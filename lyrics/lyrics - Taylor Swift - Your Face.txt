
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face
