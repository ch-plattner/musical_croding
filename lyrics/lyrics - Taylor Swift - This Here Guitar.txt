
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you 
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you 
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
This here guitar

You're my guitar

This here guitar
