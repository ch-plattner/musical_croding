
I could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use

But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway

R-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E

So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been
I don't hangout at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there
And I'm making you hear me laugh like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby

R-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E

S-A-N-I-T-Y, I hope you lose yours tonight
You made me crazy too long
So I'm working on

R-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E

Baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E
Gonna give you what you gave to me
