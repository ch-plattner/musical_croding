
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know I made your eyes burn
I was like James Dean, for sure
I'm so fresh to death & sick as ca-ca-cancer
I was sorta punk rock, You grew up on hip hop
I fit you better than your favorite sweater, 
You know, that love is mean, love hurts
You still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember, 
Baby oh
I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said I had to leave to start my life over
You were like: "No please, stay here"
We don't need no money we can make it all work
But I headed out on Sunday, said I'd come home Monday
You stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin' 
But I was, chasing paper
"Caught up in the game" that was the last you heard, Oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember, 
Baby oh
I will love you 'til the end of time

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years 
(Have always buried them deep beneath the ground)
Baby can you see through the tears?
(You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve)
Baby oh
(Have always buried them deep beneath the ground)
