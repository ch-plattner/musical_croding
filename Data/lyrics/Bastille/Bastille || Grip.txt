
As the night time leads into the day
And tomorrow spills across the sky
While the sun’s a harsh reminder why
We are feeling barely human

We don’t know what’s good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won’t discover ‘til we push it

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away
Walk away, oh it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms

We got drunk on this unholy wine
To deliver us from our old minds
A promise of a better time
'Til we’re feeling barely human

We don’t know what’s good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won’t discover ‘til we push it

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
Oh, it grips me

I would rather forget
And wash my memory clean
Oh, I would rather forget
And wash my memory clean
I would rather forget (I would rather forget)
And wash my memory clean (Wash my memory clean)
I would rather forget (I would rather forget)
And wash my memory clean (Wash my memory clean)

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
It grips me

(It grips me, it grips me)
Oh oh
(It grips me, it grips me)

Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
It grips me
