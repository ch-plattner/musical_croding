You took me to your favourite place on Earth
To see the tree they cut down ten years from your birth
Our fingers traced in circles round its history
We brushed our hands right back in time through centuries.

As you held me down, you said:

"I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told 
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines" 

Changes on our hands and on our faces, oh, oh
Memories are mapped out by the lines we'll trace

As you held me down you said: 

"I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told 
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines" 

Ashen faces in cold breeze
ashen faces in cold breeze
Armed with stories you will leave
Oh armed with stories you will leave

I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told

Cross my heart and hope to die I'll see you with your laughter lines
I'll see you in the future when we're old
I'll see you in the future when we're old
