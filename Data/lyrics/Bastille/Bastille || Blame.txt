
You go sleep with the fishes
There’s no room for you here, 
There’s no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
Cause your body’s a message, 
Send my regards to hell

Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘this is my body and soul here’
Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘you’ve got the power and control’
Don’t pin it all on me [x2]

You’ve been granted three wishes
Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth

Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘this is my body and soul here’
Fall, beg and plead 
Sing ‘you’ve got the power to control’
Don’t pin it all on me [x2]

Blame, blame, blame
(I got you, I got you)
[x4]

Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘this is my body and soul here’
Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘this is my body and soul here’
This is my body, this is my soul
Fall upon your knees 
Sing ‘you’ve got the power to control’

Don’t pin it all on me [x2]
