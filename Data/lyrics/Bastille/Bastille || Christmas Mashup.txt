[The Darkness - Christmas Time]
Christmas time, don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace

[East 17 - Stay Another Day]
Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay

[Wham - Last Christmas]
('Cause) last Christmas

[Chris Rea]
(I was) driving home for Christmas

[Mariah Carey - All I want for Christmas is you]
(And) All I want for Christmas is

[Oh Holy Night]
(To) Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)

[East 17 - Stay Another Day]
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
Oh, won't you stay another day

[Wham - Last Christmas]
('Cause) last Christmas

[Chris Rea]
(I was) driving home for Christmas

[Mariah Carey - All I want for Christmas is you]
(And) All I want for Christmas is

[Oh Holy Night]
(To) Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)

[South Park â€“ Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]
Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously, he loves you
We can make a Mr. Hanky too

[Oh Holy Night]
(Won't you) fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)

[East 17 - Stay Another Day]
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
Oh, won't you stay another day
