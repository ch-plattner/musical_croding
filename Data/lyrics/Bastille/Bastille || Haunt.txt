We make our agreements about when to meet
And I'll leave you in the doorway
The cold evening aches as it leaves in it's wake
Oh the memories left by the day

Oh and questioning why as you look to the sky
That is cloudless up above our heads
And thoughts come to mind how our short little lives
Haven't left the path that they will tread

They will tread...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

Will wisdom we learn as our minds they do burn
All the ties to naivety and youth
To adults we grow and maturity shows
Oh the terrifying rarity of truth

As you turn to your mind and youth thoughts they rewind
To old happenings and things that are done
You can't find what's past make that happiness last
Seeing from those eyes what you've become

What you've become...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

I will see you there
Will see you there
Will see you there...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you
