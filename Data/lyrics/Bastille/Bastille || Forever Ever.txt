I don't wanna talk about it [8x]

I see ahead of me a light that takes my breath
If we're only ever looking back, then how can we expect
To see each other as we are, for all that we've become
Would be friends at all if we weren't friends when we was young?
And I want to feel close to you for more than just a sake,
Of the place that we grew up in and all them times that we got baked in the park
Look, if you take me apart, you'll find half of me is you but half of me is asking me to start anew

You look the same but I don't recognize you,
I'm looking you dead in the face and I can't find you
Don't like the way we always talk in the past tense,
Can't explain the present 'til you work out what the past meant

These are the days that bind us together, forever
And these little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

There's a man I've known for years, and still to this day do I know him
I love him very much, it's very hard for me to show him
Back then and even now I feel there's something that I owe him
And that feeling should be going over time but no it's growing
We was kid mates, making mistakes, playing give take
Big hearts battling them big snakes, rattling their tails
He was like the wind in my sails, I was like the water for his keel, it was real
It use to hurt my flesh that his worn scars were heated still
He use to hurt his flesh just to see if he could feel
He took out a long straw, he was never really the strong sort
Got into the wrong sport, big swigs, long snorts
Caught in that spiral, saw attempts to help him sparkle
But soon he got so down that he got on the brown, word got around
People did not like the sound, they told me to stop popping round to see him
I kept disagreeing, soon he was a different being
He got into stealing, robbing, I still see him frequent afterwards you'd think would open eyes were throbbing
You could stop him freaking out, but to speak about the things that made him weak, his doubt
And to stop his rolling sentence, faced with paper pen to write his actions spoke dependence
Friendship became difficult to say the least, he played the beast so well
I wondered how I would ever make our peace
That's when we drifted, never argued, it just became clear
The parts of him I loved so well would slowly disappear

Those are the days that bind us together, forever
These little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and take it slowly

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and make you want me
