
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to me anymore.
And your voice is a weapon and we'll do with it what we can.
And your voice is a weapon and we'll do with it what we can.
I'll fall into your arms again, I'll fall into your arms again.
I'll fall into your arms again, I'll fall into your arms.
