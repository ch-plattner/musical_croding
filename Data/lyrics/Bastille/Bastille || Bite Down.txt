You don’t have to look any further
I’ve been waiting here for you for time
You don’t have to look any further
You’re missing what is right before your eyes

No one’s gonna stick the pieces together for you
Together for you [x2]

You’ve got your claws buried deep
Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down into me

Ooh, I’m not gonna try
Ooh, I’m not gonna try
Ooh, I’m not gonna try
No, no, no, I’m not gonna try

Oh I’m tryna keep my composure
But every time you shake coming down I die
You’ve been looking, looking me over 
I’m tired of waving my arms in the back of the line

No one’s gonna stick the pieces together for you
Together for you [x2]

Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down into me

Cuz there are only so many times
That I can come a-running
And there are only so many times
That I can come a-running for you

Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down into me

Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down into me

Ooh, I’m not gonna try
Ooh, I’m not gonna try
Ooh, I’m not gonna try
No, no, no, I’m not gonna try
