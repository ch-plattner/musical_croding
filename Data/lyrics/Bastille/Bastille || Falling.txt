"Not me...ever"
"It's unavoidable, it just happens."
"What happens?"
"When you grow up, yourï»¿ heart dies."
"who cares?"
"I care."

Walking out to the dark
Going out a different path lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town gash their eyes to the ground
Of matters to the heart
The night is all you have
You ran into the night from all you had
Found your self a path upon the ground
You ran into the night
You cant be found 
But this is your heart 

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it

Pumps through your veins

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Summer evening breeze is blue
Drawing voices deep from you
Lead by a beating heart

What a year and what a night
What terrifying final sight
Put out your beating heart

The night was all you had you ran into the night from all you had
Found your self a path upon a ground
Ran into the night you cant be found
This is your heart

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it

Pumps through your veins

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
