Just another brain on the campus 
Just another man in the field
Just another tall pile of papers 
Making it crowded in here 
Someone else's work on your thesis 
Someone else's words in your mouth 
Someone knows it's hard work and research
Taking you up in the world
Oh, never leave me out 
I stand by the sidelines
Oh, never leave me out, 
I'm standing by 

I'll watch it all from afar 
Heaven help me 
I'll watch it all fall apart 
Heaven help me 
Help me [x4]
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me

Just another brain on the campus
Just another man in the field
Just another tall pile of papers making it crowded in here
It must be so lonely, knowing what you know
Man, it must be lonely, keeping it on the low
Oh, never leave me out 
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh, never leave me out 
I'm standing by

I'll watch it all from afar 
Heaven help me
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven help me
Help me [x4]
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven, help me [x2]
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven, help me [x2]
Help me [x4]
