Ooh

Look who's digging their own grave
That is what they all say
You'll drink yourself to death

Look who makes their own bed
Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Out on the front doorstep
Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this

Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
It's just begun

Ooh

Standing on the cliff face
Highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death

Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
And this is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

You put up your defenses when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

You're putting up your armor when you leave
And you leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be, oh

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave
