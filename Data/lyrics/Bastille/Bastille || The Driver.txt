
Shout out from the bottom of my lungs
A plague on both your houses
This thing
It’s a family affair
It’s drawing out my weakness

Big boys don’t cry
They don’t ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn’t ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
‘Cause everything will change tonight

I want to be back on the ground
Where my feet touch my shadow
I want to dig my heels in the dirt
Feel it break between all of my toes
Anything to stop floating ‘round
Bring me down
Back down below, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take breath
And push the anger down
Try to remember calmness

Big boys don’t cry
They don’t ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn’t ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
‘Cause everything will change tonight

Hey now
What’s the gravity upon your face
So I’m the one who’s bleeding
Real men
Always thinkin’ with our fists
My turn to be the victim

Big boys don’t cry
They don’t ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn’t ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
‘Cause everything will change tonight

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn’t ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
‘Cause everything will change tonight
