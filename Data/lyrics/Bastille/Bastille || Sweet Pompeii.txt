[Erika:] "How are you?"
[Dan:] "Well, it's been a while since anybody asked me that."

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There's a hollow in me now

It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallow every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
If you giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me..

But if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like you've been here before?

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

If you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

"I'm great."
