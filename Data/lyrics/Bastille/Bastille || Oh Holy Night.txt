
Have been a good boy this year?

I think so.

Swear you?

No. I meant kind of a pain lately.
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I really haven't been to good this year.

Yeah.

I'm kind of sad about it, because I really like my family.
Even though sometimes I say I don't.
Sometimes I even think I don't. Do you get that?

Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
'til he appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees! Oh hear the angel voices!
Oh night divine, oh night, that leads to morn.
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born.
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine.

Merry Christmas you filthy animal.
And a happy new year.
