
I could only be myself with you around
Oh, with you around
And now there’s nothing left for me to think about
Whoa, to think about.

And it hurts like hell
To be torn apart
And it hurts like hell
To be thrown around

We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart

You stepped with a heavy tread,
And left your mark
Oh, oh, oh
Your mark on me

The space you used to fill it’s now this great black hole
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You’re out of sight but not out of my mind

And it hurts like hell
To be torn apart
And it hurts like hell
To be thrown around

We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

My yin and yang is killin’ me
gotta get back, back to the synergy 
don’t forget where I been but you’re gonna remember
when I shake my ass like a leaf of September. 

I don’t mean to kill your vibe 
but if you got it, you get it, 
and I’ve been getting this shit for a long time 

Happiness only brings heartache I’m so beyond naughty, 
and if you don’t like it then why do you want me  
I see ya, don’t front if I tickle the strings on your heart. 

You play second fiddle to my instrumental 
your critical nature departs in the middle of all of my riddles 
you’ve given up trying and now you just tear me apart
