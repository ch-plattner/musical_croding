
The weight of living, the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living
All that you desired when you were a child
Was to be old, was to be old
Now that you are here suddenly you fear
You’ve lost control, you’ve lost control
Do you like the person you’ve become... Oh

Under  the  weight  of  living?
You’re under the weight of living
 Under the weight of living
You are under the weight,
The weight of living, the weight of living

It all crept up on you, in the night it got you
 And plagued your mind, it plagues your mind
 Every day it passes faster than the last did
 And you’ll be old, soon you’ll be old
Do you like the person you’ve become...

Under the weight of living?
You’re under the weight of living
Under the weight of living
You are under the weight,
The weight of living, the weight of living


Oh tell yourself this is how it’s going to be
Oh tell yourself this is how it’s going to be... Oh

Under the weight of living 
You’re under the weight of living
Under the weight of living
You are under the weight,
The weight of living, the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living
