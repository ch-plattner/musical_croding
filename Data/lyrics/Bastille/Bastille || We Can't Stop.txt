Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet someone here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home, well,
Can I get a "hell, no! "? (hell no)
'Cause we're gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight

So la da di da di
We like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout the life?

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, they don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

Yeah ohh, oh-oh, oh-oh

To all my home girls here with the big butts
Shaking it like we're in a strip club
Remember only dad can judge us
Forget the haters 'cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Queuing up to get into the bathroom
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah, yeah

So la da di da di
We like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout the life?

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, they don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand
Oh-oh-oh

Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand
Oh oh oh

Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand
Oh oh oh

Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand

And she can't stop
And she won't stop
Can't you see it's she who owns the night?
Can't you see it's she who 'bout that life?

And she can't stop
And she won't stop
She runs things, they don't run she
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah
