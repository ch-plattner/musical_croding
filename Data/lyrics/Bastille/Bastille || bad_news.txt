
Bad news like a sucker punch, what do you say?
Air knocked out of my lungs, your cue to stay
When you hear something difficult don't back away
Some people say nothing, good ones engage

Don't turn your back on me
Don't bury your head deep
Just cause you don't know what to say

Don't turn your back on me
Don't bury your head deep
Just cause you don't know what to say

It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh it beats you black and blue before you see it coming

Bad news like a sucker punch blew me away
People fill the streets like nothing has changed
Clock hands tick along, they don't look the same
Planes fly overhead like any old day

Don't turn your back on me
Don't bury your head deep
Just cause you don't know what to say

Don't turn your back on me
Don't bury your head deep
Just cause you don't know what to say

It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh it beats you black and blue before you see it coming

Maybe I just want some words of distraction
I feel like I'm being consumed
Maybe I'm expecting the perfect reaction
To pull me back

It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh it beats you black and blue before you see it coming

It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh it beats you black and blue before you see it coming
