
I keep on looking for something I can't get,
broken hearts lie all around me and I don't
see an easy way to get out of this.

Her diary sits on the bedside table,
the curtain's closed, the cat's in the cradle
and who would have thought that a boy like
me could come to this?

Oh oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been something you said,
I just died in your arms tonight.
Oh oh, I, I Just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been some kind of kiss,
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on the list,
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again.
I'm lost and found, it's my final mistake,
she's love in my proxy, no give it, all take,
'cause I've been thrilled to fantasy too many times.

Oh oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been something you said,
I just died in your arms tonight.
Oh oh, I, I Just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been some kind of kiss,
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.

It was a long hot night, she made it easy,
she made it feel right, but now it's over,
the moment is gone, I'm following my hands,
not my head.
I know

Oh oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been something you said,
I just died in your arms tonight.
Ohoh, I, I Just died in your arms tonight,
it must have been some kind of kiss,
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.
I should've walked away.
