All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
Keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
And any old music will do

I wanna make a million dollars
I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family

All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
And any old music will do

When I hold you baby
Feel your heart beat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

When I wake each morning
Every spawn beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

Set you free
Set you free
Set you free
Set you free
Oh, oh yeah
