Ooh I'm not ready [x8]

Snakes are biting my heels
They follow through the grass
I'll keep kicking them away
What if my resolve just can not last

If I'm not ready
Life will just eat me whole 
If I'm not steady 
Maybe I'll lose control

But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole

Now the sky is getting dark
Can't you hear the thunder start to roar
So I'll be picking up the pace
Block out things I'd rather just not know

If I'm not ready
Life will just eat me whole 
If I'm not steady 
Maybe I'll lose control

But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole
Yes I pray for the ground to swallow me whole

If I'm not ready
Life will just eat me whole 
If I'm not steady 
Maybe I'll lose control

But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole
Yes I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole
