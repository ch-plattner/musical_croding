
So you want to be free
To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give, If we cry
Will we live or will we die
[x2]

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give
[x2]

Tainted hearts healed with time
Shoot that love so we can stop to the end
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die

Solitary brother is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister is there still a part of you that wants to give
[x2]
