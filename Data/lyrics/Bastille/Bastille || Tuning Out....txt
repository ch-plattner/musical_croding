
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of your dear saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night that leads to morn

Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night
O night divine

Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands
All that remains
