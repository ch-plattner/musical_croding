[Spoken (Excerpt from Psycho):]
[Norman:] Well, I run the office and tend the cabins and grounds and do the errands for my mother. The ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
[Marion:] And do you go out with friends?
[Norman:] Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

[Dan Smith:]
A scrub is a guy who thinks he’s fly and is also known as a buster
Always talkin’ about what he wants and just sits on his broke ass

So, no, I don’t want your number
No, I don’t want to give you mine and
No, I don’t want to meet you nowhere
No, don’t want none of your time

No, I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holla at me
I don’t want no scrubs

A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holla at me
Trying to holla at me at me

[Ella:]
But a scrub's checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get with no dead-beat ass
So

[Dan Smith:]
No, I don’t want your number
No, I don’t want to give you mine and
No, I don’t want to meet you nowhere
No, don’t want none of your time
No

[Ella:]
I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holla at me
I don’t want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holla at me
Holler at me
Holler at me
Holler at me

[Dan Smith:]
If you don’t have a car and you’re walking
(Oh yes son, I’m talking to you)
If you live at home with your momma
[Norman:] We're all in our private traps
If you have a shorty but you don’t show love
[Norman:] Clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don’t want no

No scrubs, no scrubs
[Marion:] Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
No scrubs,
[Norman:] I was born in mine; I don't mind it anymore
No scrubs,
[Marion:] Oh but you should, you should mind it
No scrubs,
[Norman:] Oh I do, but I say I don't

[Together:]
No, I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holla at me
I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
[Ella:] Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me
[Ella:] Holler at me
Trying to holler at me
