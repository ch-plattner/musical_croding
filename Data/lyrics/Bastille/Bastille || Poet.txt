
Obsession it takes control
Obsession it eats me whole
I can't say the words out loud
So in rhyme I wrote you down

Now you'll live through the ages
I can feel your pulse in the pages

I have written you down
Now you will live forever
And all the world will read you
And you live forever
In eyes not yet created
On tongues that are not born
I have written you down
Now you will live forever

Your body lies upon the sheets
Of paper and words so sweet
I can't say the words
So I wrote them into my verse

Now you'll live through the ages
I can feel your pulse in the pages

I have written you down
Now you will live forever
And all the world will read you
And you will live forever
In eyes not yet created
On tongues that are not born
I have written you down
Now you will live forever

I have read her with these eyes,
I've read her with these eyes,
I have held her in these hands

I have written you down
Now you will live forever
The virtue's in the verse
And you will live forever

I have written you down
Now you will live forever
And all the world will read you
And you will live forever
In eyes not yet created
On tongues that are not born
I have written you down
You will live forever
You will live forever
