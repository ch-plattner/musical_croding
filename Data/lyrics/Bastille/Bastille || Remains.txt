
I came here for sanctuary, away from the winds and the sounds of the city.
I came here to get some peace, way down deep where the shadows are heavy.
I can't help but think of you.
In these four walls my thoughts seem to wonder
To some distant century where everyone we know is six feet under.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me for all to see.

When our lives are over and all that remains.
Are our skulls and bones let's take it to the grave.
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms, I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains.

I don't want to rest in peace, we can haunt each other's dreams.
We'll fight underneath this turf, bicker away in darkness.
We'll find our way to result our way from the lands of the living.
We'll find a common ground and fall in love all over again.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me for all, all to see.

When our lives are over and all that remains.
Are our skulls and bones let's take it to the grave.
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms, I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains.

From dust to dawn.
The other's screams grow silent in defeat.
I know I chased a memory but you used to taste so sweet.
As you faded away I realised it's all over and nothing stays the same
From our skulls and bones and grave.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me for all, all to see.

When our lives are over and all that remains.
Are our skulls and bones let's take it to the grave.
Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms, I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains.
