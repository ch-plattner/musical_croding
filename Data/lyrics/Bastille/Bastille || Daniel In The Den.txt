
Moving along at a pace unknown to man
Go go go go go go
Go go go go go

And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died
Oh they would crown another
And it's harder than you think
Telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you

Dreaming along at a pace you'll understand
Go go go go go go
No no no no no

And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died
Oh they would crown another
And it's harder than you think
Telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you

Oh, to see what it means to be free
Of the shackles and the dreams
That you claim to see

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you

Oh

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love
They will come for you

And felled in the night
By the ones you think you love.
Felled in the night
By the ones you think you love.
Felled in the night
By the ones you think you love, love.
