[Angel Haze:]
Yeah
This is vocal detection
Front lining our open intellection
Outlining opening profession
This is a vocal confession
Right now your cause is at war
Screaming you want it and more
Sit down ambassador reference
Right now your voice is a weapon
Wake up to stars in the sky
Watch light revolve with your mind
Watch all the storms in the rise
And put all your palms in the sky
No more falling to pressure
No more failing acceptance
Throw all your hells towards the heavens
Cause your voice is a weapon

[Dan:]
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms

[Angel Haze:]
We dance with the devils
And make your halos the color of sinner's portraits
And smothering it means everything's lovely again
Nothing's quite as it seems
Society's altered you see
Kill all your fear in your sleep
Cause everything's formed in a dream
Breathe in insanity's grip
Words from insanity's lips
Falling from sanity's cliff
Watching your vanity slip
No more falling to pressure
No more failing acceptance
Throw all your hells towards the heavens
Cause your voice is a weapon

[Dan:]
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms

[Angel Haze:]
Pressure that deepen the cut
Run for the evil erupt
Volcanic feverish lust
That shit that even it out
Pressure is feeding the dust
Breakfast is keeping the cut
Vengeance is me speaking up
This is me speaking up

[Dan:]
And your voice is a weapon
This is vocal confession
And it's shooting you down, down, down
And your voice is a weapon
This is vocal confession
And we're shooting you down, down, down
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we'll do with it what we can
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms again
I'll fall into your arms

[F*U*G*Z/Braque:]
Choose your words and etch them on your soul
Make them heard when crowds drown out your call
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions
A wake has to be left so never falter down
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
