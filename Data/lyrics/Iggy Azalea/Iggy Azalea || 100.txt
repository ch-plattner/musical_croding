[Intro - Watch The Duck:]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me
Yeah, that's why I keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me
Girl, when you come around me
When you come around me
Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Verse 1 - Iggy Azalea:]
Time to keep it 100, I'm a boss chick but he run it
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour
In Spain wearing that Balmain
Lanvin, Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse
I got ten toads in that concrete
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit
I don't need your money, I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know I'll put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six and he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with
They talk shit but we 'bout shit
Fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be, where he need to be
I tell him "go on, it ain't no thing to me"
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back
Would you let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high class ass when you met me
My money talk, it's too bad for y'all
Y'all know which shorty's Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet
Know every bitch you had ain't never had shit
Respect that, I won't come around, no run around
You better hold me down
And the games, ain't gonna play none
Keep it A1 since day one, yeah

[Hook - Watch The Duck:]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me
Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Verse 2 - Iggy Azalea:]
Bank-Rolls'r'us, we got it
You know how we ride
No credit, no debit, no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walking by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like "Damn bitch, can't say hi?"
Then I hop in the drop and I wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he not there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinking about it
You got no idea
Don't try me man, you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new rover whip
The fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there
No asking what you doing there
Imma send my crew in there
You two gonna be ruined there
You violate, I demonstrate
Especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual

[Hook - Watch The Duck]

[Bridge - Watch The Duck & Iggy Azalea:]
100, 100 as usual
(When I come around I keep it 100 as usual)
