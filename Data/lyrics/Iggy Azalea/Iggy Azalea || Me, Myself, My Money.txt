[Hook x2]
They'd buy my shit if they could
Damn I make it look good
I'm about to paper like wood
Oh you hating yeah, you should
Cause it's just me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money

These moreschi's killing my feet
Versace shades 'cause I'm feeling low key
Case of ace 'cause the homies with me
No ID, they know me
ITG that's how you sound
Chic Luzana I ain't camera
Might put diamonds on my McLaren
Like damn that white bitch crazy
My stunts insane, yeah fuck you payin'
They pay me more 'cause I get shit
you one hundred six four
Six oh oh don't send that dough
Wash MC's stay white like sheets
Crack rock flow bitch cook that dough
Put it in the streets say took that dough
I took that dough, threw it to the ceiling
It fell on the floor, Iggy you killin' I already know
Can't tell me nothing if you already broke. I'm already on
Aiming for the stars I'm already gone
Gotta have dinner with a man on the moon
Married to the shit and the money's my groom
I'm sweeping that shit, Ey grab that broom

[Hook]
They'd buy my shit if they could
Damn I make it look good
I'm about the paper like wood
Oh you hating yeah, you should
Cause it's just me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money

All wins no losses, life of a boss bitch
All I need is an office,
I'm killing shit off.
All I need is a coffin,
Ridin' circles while they wheeze and they coughing 
Let the bullshit walk, let my money do the talking
Put up runner walk 'cause there's my target
Rodeo Drive yeah that's my target
Pull up, park it no keys shit
Push it start it, trim cocktails
His name is Marcus, haters salty
Nuts and cashews, I came with Ben and Andrew
We might just 'cause a scandal,
Find out that we menage our Nicky's handle
Yeah that's my M.O, I'm on fire
Just lit the candle, head in sky
Bitch I'm the shit, you should think so too
G shit, just gimme my money, M. O. Y.  money over you!

[Hook]
They'd buy my shit if they could
Damn I make it look good
I'm bound to paper like wood
Oh you hating yeah, you should
Cause it's just me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money

It's just me, myself, my money
In the land of the milk and honey
I came with some playboy bunnies
And Hef just said he coming
This shit right here by dollars
To stunt on hoes is my honour
This bitch must be in hell
If the devil wears Prada
Keep it real they don't want nada
Getting cheese like enchiladas
You ain't talking 'bout that money
what the fuck you sayin'
I'm cashing out what the fuck you
playing, playing, playing
You ain't talking 'bout that money
what the fuck you sayin'

[Hook x2]
They'd buy my shit if they could
Damn I make it look good
I'm about the paper like wood
Oh you hating yeah, you should
Cause it's just me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
