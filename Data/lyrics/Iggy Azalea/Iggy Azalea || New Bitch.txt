[Verse 1]
He got a house that's too big
Sits on a hill in the valley
Said he trying to move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride cause I don't want us overlapping
Spendin' money on Mac, that's cute, I get checks from them in Paris
Better check my tax bracket
What you think was gonna happen
Naggin', now he's had it
And y'all fell off like Mad Men
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch
She's no housewife, just desperate
I know it's hard to let go but accept it

[Pre-hook]
Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
'His' and 'her' gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon' hate
They gon' have something to say

[Hook]
When I hop out his new six
Fresh in some new shit
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this?"
Yeah I'm his new bitch
I'm his new bitch
And I'm spending his new cash
Few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad
Oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch
Yeah, I'm his new bitch

[Interlude - Spoken]
She be the one that be like
"Hey, girl, what's up? You in town?"
Yes, I'm in town, kissing ---- on the face, and you know this
So just say it

[Verse 2]
It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws
Driving, riding, all black suits up
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew
And what I do, it can't be compared
You well done and bitch I'm rare
So stop popping up unexpected
Stop sending threats and text messages
We too grown for this messy shit
This will be my last conversation
If you don't want no problems, move yourself from the equation

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Tell your friends to tell their friends too
He got a new chick but it ain't you
I'm just saying, you know it's true
Cry a river and swim on through
I know you hoping we won't make it
Clyde and Bonnie, let the world chase us
Ride or die where the world takes us
If we end up poor or rich and famous
I'm all he needs and more chick
His home chick
His tour chick
His 4th finger, left hand chick
And all those people go 'Damn, chick'

[Hook]
