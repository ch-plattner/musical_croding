White girl, team full of bad bitches
DRUGS Gang, I'm in the zone
Aussie ho, I put my Country on
G shit, I'm what you ain't
6'4 dip with candy paint
I get done, what you can't
White bitch down slugs, and gangstas faint
I shut it down, go and hate
I had enough of these hoes
No time to waste
Amazing grace, embrace the place
You basic bitch, get out my face
I'm on the phone closing deals
George tell em next, half a mill
On the phone closing deals
George tell em next, half a mill

Cotton candy, laced in gold
Stack that money, sushi roll
Bottles up, feeling throw'd
V.I.P it, overload
[x2]

My world, rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
[x4]

Ugh, hands in the air
This is for the bitches getting money up in here

My world, rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
[x2]

Ugh
Enough of that
Now I'm finna kill this shit
Chordz 3D with another hit
Call me the pound
I'ma kill this bitch

Pound for pound around town
I'm the illest bitch
You see me, be the realest bitch
You high off mines
You snorting shit

Higher than a motherfucker
Better never been on other rhyme
In the gutter got them saying she the other color
Me and your man, secret agents, we under covers
My team on the scene, stay clean on these other brothers
Talk shit get his nut fucking nutter butter
Iggy Pop, I'm gone bitch, burn rubber
Bottles over here, more till I die
Sparkle every bottle, see the glare in my eye
Turned over here, it's the 4th of July
White, Black, Asian, Latin Hoes, Middle Eastern
It's time to show, we run this shit, gotta let them know

Cotton candy, laced in gold
Stack that money, sushi roll
Bottles up, feeling throw'd
V.I.P it, overload
