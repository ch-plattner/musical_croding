No pussyhole can come in our place
In our arena, in our establishment
And try talk the talk and walk the walk
And act like them don't know where we from
Like we don't have the biggest in hundred
Iggy, what you say?
What you say?
Bullet!

[Hook x2:]
Classic, Sinatra
Bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Paper planes, roger that, 10-4
Got money, been had it, still gettin' more
Oh y'all in the building, but on different floors
Y'all couldn't see it how we see it on ya tippie-toes
Iggy so killing, so pretty, still pretty
Talkin' hits on hits, McGuire, Bonds, Griffey
Mash it up bring the queens of the dancehall with me
Pearl handle on the pistol, tell this world to come and get me
And I'm thummin' through designers to pick which'll fit me proper
Paid dues, climbed through the ranks, but we ain't Shabba
Need me a rude boy, something straight out the shockers
That could drive a girl crazy, all the way off my rocker
Versaces over eyelids, lookin' like Biggie Poppa
No they thought I wouldn't make it, I'm lookin' like what's the matter?
But tell them money talks, and them man not saying nada
This the new classic, signed sincerely, Lady Patra

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mavado]
She's special and phenomenal
Body strong like a stallion
She got me wild like an animal
Chop it up, eh pon de floor
Chop it up, eh pon de floor
You put your whine dynamical
Billion dollar shit, trillion dollar looks
Tell them broke bitch, read it in the books
Your thing turn up, you got Louis on your foot
You know you got gully on the hook
It's the [?]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Said she need a real man
Oh yes she want a real one
So she fuck with a Jamaican
Done (haha!)
Your body lookin' like a billion dollar
The baddest bitch you ever seen
The one I want to be my baby mama
I fuck her like my enemy

[Hook x2]
