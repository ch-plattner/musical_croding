TRAPGOLD...

I got twenty racks on my new jeans, I got ten more in my blue jeans
I walk in and I turn up, pimp tight like I'm permed up
I heard broke bitches talkin' like they rollin' like us 
Man, these bitches sound shermed up
These bitches be mad at us because these bitches so down to fuck
Cl-cl-claim that shit, I can bang that shit
Fuck me, fuck a team, I'mma train that bitch
I hope you ain't wife that bitch 'cause I know a couple homies that'll pipe that bitch
Lifestyle flashin' like a Nikon pic
And your bitch chose me 'cause you walk out with
My ass thick, and my drinks mixed, say I'm sick, I say "No shit"
Better fo' drip, and that's a fo' sip and all my flows is slow piff
Closed case, I'm killin' shit, heard your flow, I'm not feelin' shit
My brand right and I'm on one
And these bitches don't want none 
These bitches don't want none [x2]

I shine bright 'cause I grind 
Bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my time
[x4]
