
Pocket on loud, bottle full of yes
Little bit of poison, little bit of death
Little bit of ass, and a whole lotta hips
All white all night, I ain't talkin' bout bricks
That ain't cocky, that's confidence
Speak English, what the problem is?
You a 1+1 simple sum'a'bitch
I'm long divis', so hard to get
Just passed go, you a starter kit
You prevalence, can't find like this
Hard to swallow somethin' this sick
Still tryna figure how to market it
I'm a backseat rider, head held higher
Pussy tighter, always flier
Never measure up to a bitch like me, girl
You will never climb a mountain this steep, girl
We different breeds, you imperial, I'm so metric
I'm stuntin' on hoes, far as I know
None of y'all strong enough to carry my load
None of y'all down to go as far as I go
Put the still to your neck and let it unload
Like bam bam bam!
What you do that fo'?
To let you know
Know what?
To get your weight up
Sky high fly, I don't even need your paper
So now you know, to get your weight up
Sky high fly, I don't even need your paper
