In the 9/11, 9187 merk shit

Kill "A" ego, any pride
Creamating the hating, it's a murda in the making
I'm taking out shine on top
Buy all bottles from the bar, let's pop champagne
Let them niggas die of thurst, man we about hurt
When the light hit the chain all you see is fire works
Un-mute niggas turned up all the way
Shoot nigga with the swag dock holiday
I'm steady blowin' loud, broke niggas ain't allowed
Click clack bang bang, pow pow
It's a Murda Bizness
