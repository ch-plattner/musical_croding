[Verse 1]
Iggy Iggy pussy illy
Wetter than the Amazon
Taste this kitty
Silly Billy poppin' pilly's
Smoke it like a swisher
Lick this philly
Mold em ah! Soak em ah!
Hook em like crack, after shock
Molten ah! Lava drop
This should be outlawed, call me Pac
(Pu$$y pu$$y)
The illest on the planet
Better play ya cards right Mr. Gambit
If you wanna hang here, ain't no Hammock
Never, no better, law should ban it
Never, no better, law should ban it
I do it right, wit drugs understand it
I do it right, now please sir pan it

[Hook]
Left right back to the middle
Head on swivel neck till I quivel
Open ya mouth
Taste the rainbow taste my Skittles ah!

Pu$$y pu$$y pu$$y

[Verse 2]
You know bitches envy me
Cause you won't get rid of me
When you cum, I run
This cat got you missin' me
Bad Boys get a mouth full of pussy aka Listerine
Here to make you lose your mind
Gonna need a Sherlock Holmes
To solve your mystery, I'm nasty
Baby what you thinking? Aka Titanic
So much wet will have yo ass sinking
Treat that tongue like a bullet
Give me head, Abe Lincoln
This is so out this world
But no you not dreamin'

[Hook]
Left right back to the middle
Head on swivel neck till I quivel
Open ya mouth
Taste the rainbow, taste my Skittles ah!
