[Hook:]
Looking up North, while you're touching down South (muah)
I say it where I want it so you taking it out [x2]

I'm going, going, going, going, going Down South
I'm going, going, going, going, going kiss that mouth [x2]

Kiss that muah muah muah [x4]

Went down the kiss...
This pink pussy got no lipstick...
More like lip gloss when it's sticky 
Ain't no bitch bossin' like Iggy 
I'm gettin' head with my shades on 
He head over heels, he wake on 
Got his face lookin' all painted on 
When he done gettin' his taste on 
But aint no returnin' this favor 
When you get done put your name on this waver 
Makin a statement bout how you ate this 
Fittin'a put it and finna? 
I'm givin' it to you no chaser 
But this (meow) be wet on the rocks 
Iggy do fades, and braids it really don't matter 
This pussy gon' drip on them locks 
That Hello Kitty; no pencil pouch 
This pussy neat like it's stenciled out 
I got his tongue shinin', call him Mr. Clean 
It's like Listerine when he rinse it out 
I got his girls callin' on missions now 
When they say they mad 'cause they missin' out 
But I'm very fine and his face is clogged 
And he say he love it when he kissin' now 

[Hook]

Jumpin' out the dam like a motherfuckin' laker hoe 
Do me one favor, don't do me no favors 
And I get 380 every time he 360s 
Got my old dude calling, go my new dude with me 
Startin' in the A then he lead me the Bay 
Pit stop in Texas? 
Ask him "baby, how it taste, I bet it taste good' 
Pullin' out in slauson; I better taste hood 
Got me like "yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo, and Louis" 
No department stores I'm in boutiques 
If it ain't high class it don't suit me 
Got that bubblicious; that chewy 
Make your man act like a groupie 
You like fruit then imagine I'm smoothie 
Pussy Monster; give me that tunechi 
Said he want a blow fish, I'm hoodie 
Follow my legs to my booty 
Self sufficient I do me 
Broke hoes think I'm boujee 
Moody... who me? 
Why man? I'm rudie 
So I drop the top on my two seat 
While he roll his tongue on my tootsie 

[Hook]
