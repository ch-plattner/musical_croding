Fine aussie lady had a bad bitch
And she grew to be me
Fuck a dime, I’m a dollar

Bitch dine at Kitana
Rattle, Dolce and Gabanna
Diapers killin' your expenses
Bottle’s Hermes, bitch
If I burp that spit expensive
Wrong, kill a bitch with the heels
D.O.A when I step for realz
Ill, rap a ho in hole
This ain’t whole, ot’s just a drill
I’m on the stars

No chocolate bacon
Raping bars, I know
Throw that bitch in jail
Give a ho that L
Bout to roll that L. Thomas Westly
