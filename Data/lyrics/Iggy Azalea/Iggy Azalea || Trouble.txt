[Verse 1 - Iggy Azalea:]
Right
I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cause (oo) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Hook - Jennifer Hudson:]
Don't you come here thinking you ballin' (oh nah)
Ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me

[Verse 2 - Iggy Azalea:]
Opposites attract, I guess this it that
Good girl, bad guy what a perfect match
And if we (ooo), you gon' want to pay back tithes
Cause when you finish you gon' feel like you was baptized
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive
Cause you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Hook - Jennifer Hudson]

[Verse 3 - Iggy Azalea:]
I gotta beg for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position then
I shoulda never got involved in the first place
But second place never get the recognition, hmm
See what he doin' to me make have to shout it out
Got a hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters, hmm

[Bridge - Jennifer Hudson x2:]
Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

[Bridge 2 - Iggy Azalea (and Jennifer Hudson):]
I shoulda known you were bad news (oo oo oo, knew you were bad news)
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos (oo oo oo, all of the tattoos)
I shoulda known you were bad news (oo oo oo, knew you were bad news)
But I'm undecided tryna figure out if that's you (oo oo oo, trouble to me)

[Hook - Jennifer Hudson]
