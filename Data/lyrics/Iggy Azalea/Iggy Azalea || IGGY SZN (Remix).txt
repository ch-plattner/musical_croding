If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time
(Mike Will Made it)

One shot, two shot, three shot, four
This the one will bring the pretty girls to the floor
Twerk it, drop it, Miley in here
Party turnt up, Miley, Miley in here

And all the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun
Get it, all the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun, fun, fun, fun...

[Iggy Azalea:]
Every man needs some Azalea
You want it, you do what I tell ya
You play on my team and get a ring back
You don't, you gon' end up a failure
I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me
Just cause hubby is a fan of me you understandin' me? (mm)
So skip the talking baby, we too busy ballin' baby
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stallin' baby
Bitches gon' hate, while the critics critique
I pay they no mind whenever they speak
What they make a year, I can make in a week
I know you can't stand it just get you a seat
See the sky be the limit when you dealin' with me
I'm stuntin' this hard, and I ain't even reached my peak
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat
I'm feeling like I got this world on my feet
Hm, Iggz

Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy Season
Til I get what I want, baby I ain't leavin'
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show me
I just see a girl in the mirror, told her: "you the reason"
Simmer down bitch, it's Iggy Season
Simmer down bitch, it's Iggy Season
I ain't worried 'bout shit, it's Iggy Season
Bad bitches scream YAAAAAASSSSSSSS
It's Iggy Season

[Miley Cyrus:]
If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time
Turn Up
If you came here to have a good time,
If you came here to have a good time
(Pretty ladies)

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?

(1 2 3)

If I told you what I'm worth, you would throw up
So have my money on time before I show up
I'm drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs
Thinking money 25/8, no free days
If your girl dumb body, I recruit them
They ask me who you do it for, me say they youth them
Damn right, I like the life I live
Who else you know that slay like Iggz
You lil'...

Fun, fun, fun, fun...
Get it fun
(One shot, two shot, three shot, four shot)
(One shot, two shot, three shot, four shot)
(One shot, two shot, three shot, four shot)

And all the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun
Get it, all the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun

[Iggy Azalea:]
Drop down on 'em, bring 'em back up
Iggy Igg in the building, call for backup
See I don't want nothing but them stacks
So if you see a bad bitch, point her out, where she at doe?
Now clap, clap, clap, clap it on 'em
Now clap, clap, clap, clap it on 'em
So we don't wanna never turn down
So go ahead and get ratchet on

Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy Season
Til I get what I want, baby I ain't leavin'
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show me
I just see a girl in the mirror, told her: "you the reason"
Simmer down bitch, it's Iggy Season
Simmer down bitch, it's Iggy Season
I ain't worried 'bout shit, it's Iggy Season
Bad bitches scream YAAAAAASSSSSSSS
It's Iggy Season
