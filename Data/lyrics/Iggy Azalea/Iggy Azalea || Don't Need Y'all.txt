[Verse 1:]
I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
Cause I don't want none of that fake love
Cause I'm looking and all of that be made up

[Hook:]
I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone

I don't need y'all anyway [x6]
I don't need y'all

[Verse 2:]
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stress more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you haven't seen
Talking 'bout
No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
So now I need money, put it all in my discussions

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high

[Hook]
