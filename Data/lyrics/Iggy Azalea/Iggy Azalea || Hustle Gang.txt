[Intro:]
Yeah, hustle gang nigga
G.D.O.D get dough or die
You ain't got no money nigga, fuck you

[T.I.:]
Let go, hustle gang
Play no fucking games
T.I.P.K.I.N.G you know my fucking name, haha
Haters drop salt when they see the king
Chips they come to london they know how to treat a king
On highways whippin bentleys to the left side
On the eastern hemisphere hollarin west side
All we do is lay low and get high
Pray to the most high, live never let die

I swear I'm super cool, still will set fire
To a nigga then I up and go hop on a red eye
Till I'm dead I'm a live like it's all bad
They say it's all good
Platinum dog tag
Yellow gold rolley
Yellow hoe know me
In beverly hills gettin me and ballin like Kobe, Swish!
Do my dirt all by my lonely get no cody
Shot 'em dead, my bitch went and took the charge for me
In the phantom tell b-o-b hit the garage for me
G.D.O.D Get dough or die answer to God only

[Chipmunk:]
I said rose's just a pussy
Fuck her I'll go in
You can catch a hollow tip for thinking you're a king
Royalty, hustle gang keep the crown with us
The only queens around here are the girls fucking us
And the haters get skipped,
Double dutch, TIP got us strapped in gear
Press prešs double clutch
Play with the bread, meet a toaster
Need a ghost before I'm ghost
Word to the holy ghost
Yeah, I put my city on the map
Everybody's on the jack spot
On the flat room
Word to the union, everytime we're ruling 'em
Real talk, even pump the pill that keeps a tool with them
Heaven sent me go to hell money
Rolling in the deep still, I need that Adele money
Went to the grammies I need six to keep my rolley all yellow
Just the same as my bitch
North to the south I be in the mix
My location on Twitter should be writing your checks
It's bed time for your career
Pussy lay down
Car full circle of buzz
Cool I spray them rounds
Yeah from LDN to the A town
Time to make the whole world know my name now

[Iggy Azalea:]

Rocks like burning rubber
They blind just stand
But listen milf I am a mother fucker
Hustle gang you got it bad and I don't mean no usher
My hustle gang they bring them clips ok excuse me pusha
Your malice, way past average, a bad bitch
Your man texts us like dallas
Be mad at him, I'm amazing
