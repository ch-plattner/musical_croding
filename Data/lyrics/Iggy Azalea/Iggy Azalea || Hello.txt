Look, we gettin' money
We spendin' money
There's june money and decemeber money
Theres summer money and winter money
Cold-co-co-co-cold.
Clothes on top of clothes
I'm flyer than a bird and I'm shittin' on you hoes
Whatchu know bitch I'm on.
And can't nobody turn me off
And if I was a dick I would be hard but you would make me soft, my god.
He's choosing like hello hello so pretty bitch hey yellow yellow
Blond but please don't think I'm dumb
I'm getting to this bread [?]
Where's there grey poupon
These dudes is on my jock
Everytime I come you would think I was trippin shit the way they throw them ones at me

I can make you go,
I can make you move,
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do.
I walk in they like hello hello hello,
I walk in they like hello hello hello [x2]

Fuck you bitches,
You ugly bitches,
You stupid bitches,
You dummy bitches,
You dusty bitches
Don't touch me bitches whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.
No no no no no
You're not on my level,
You're not even close.
These are ferragamo baby
What the fuck are those?
Since you sniff pussies and cry baby
Go and blow your nose.
Bitch I'm on.
And if I have to tell you one more time I'll blow
Like a bomb, or a horn, or a bitch behind a bungalow at prom.
What I'm on.
I swear these bitches not.
This pussy two times. twat, twat.
Pussy two more times is exactly what he got.
After I made it hot and he spent up all his gwap
I'm talking racks on top of racks.
And stacks on top of that.
He took me to the shops and I got bags on top of bags.
You just like orphan annie get a kitchen back them rags.
You're not lookin' too good and that's too bad so sad.

I can make you go,
I can make you move,
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do.
I walk in they like hello hello hello,
I walk in they like hello hello hello [x2]
