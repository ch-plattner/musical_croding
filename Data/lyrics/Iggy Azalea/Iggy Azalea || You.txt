
Searchin' for a dude that can call me wifey
Ready for the ring, just maybe I might be
Never been a smut, I don't care who like me
I can count on one hand all the dudes that's piped me
Takin kinda long, time is movin on, been feelin kinda strong, love is on the phone
Ya sayin that I'm here, if only you could hear
My heart yellin' out, I wanted to compare
I know what I deserve, I demand the bestest
That's why all my past dudes names is ex's
Keep that thing in your pants I don't need your sex's
Better come correct when you step to a princess
Queen on the throne, listen to this song
If you out there, step into my zone
Show me how you rock, gimme what you got
Make me your one, let's hit the top

[Chorus: x2]
I need someone that's new, who knows what to do.
I need someone like you, someone like you, someone like you, someone like you

[YG:]
Hey how you doin babygirl it's nice to meet ya
Got me wanna freak ya, just by ya features
Hopin this conversation leads to a situation
And that situation leads to sensation
Left wranglers, I got em don't worry
I'm the type of dude these chicks talk about on Maury, yup
Cold story but I got alot of ex girls
So why I wanna put a alphabet above my next girl
Thug nigga, thug nigga, thug nigga
If I wasn't a rapper then I'd probably be a drug dealer
Yep and she loves me for that
Put on her favourite slow song and she fuck me to that

[Chorus: x2]
I need someone that's new, who knows what to do.
I need someone like you, someone like you, someone like you, someone like you

Better then the others
Tell them girls to get low
I dance for my baby in the room I dip low
Givin him my body, yeah I act so ex oh
On my neck where he best so papi don't let go
Are you out there? Bring it over here
If so where, hands in the air
Let's start a new life, take on the world
Grab my hand, make me your girl

[Chorus: x2]
I need someone that's new, who knows what to do.
I need someone like you, someone like you, someone like you, someone like you
