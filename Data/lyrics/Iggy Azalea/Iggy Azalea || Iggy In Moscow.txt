Listen, I hope you're listening.
Dismissing my opposition.
Good riddance to all you bitches.
I'm finished with all you bitches.
I'm cooking, I said I'm cooking. Fresh out the pot
Now you looking, I got you looking, you want my spot.

I mean its one for the haters,one for the road.
Literally, bitch, I let her go.
You ain't got a name, I Let you go.
Whoop that trick-Hustle Flow.
Do you really, really wanna go?
You take one, shit, I take 40 - Producer O.V.O
Think you know all about me like Wiki, ho?
All you do is Dream like you was Christina Milian.
I'm sorry Nicki but these hoes disrespecting hard.
Had to address the nonsense, here's a postcard.

Smell aroma. I kill these hoes.
At least they'd know their not tricked out.
Put beats in comas. Rhymes so sick. Words [?]

You're defeated before you speak it. Now deleted. End of your plan.
In time you will all see, I'm so fresh man.
Your mouth fronting, hey. It get tackled.
Nagalova, bitch. Second home: The Big Apple
Who want beef, ho? I heard cattle.
Bury bitches in the sand. I'm making sand castles.

Very likely that I'll reach a high, insane.
So I hope you got a rain coat. Ready for this rain.
Hang yourself. Stop. Let me get this cake.
Better luck next time. Oh its my time. You're [?]

And leave, rake, leave- fall
Heel bottoms look like crime scene, ball!
Red bottoms. Fans? Got 'em.
Getting in these bitches ass', yea-sodom

I'm dope as a rapper on a millie.
Bank account in a week, about a million.
George book me for a million shows.
New Classic. Take over. Straight beast mode
