[Hook 4x:]
Imma change your life, Imma change it
Imma change your life (life)

[T.I.:]
Yo, Hustle Gang homey, real talk, no bullshit

[Verse 1 — Iggy Azalea:]
You used to dealing with basic bitches
Basic shit all the time
I'm a new classic, upgrade your status
From a standby to a frequent flyer
Pop out your past life, and I'll renovate your future
Then I integrate my genius shit we purchasin' not perusing,
Yeah, I love your hustle, baby
Just let me add a little bit of muscle, baby

Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up
And I'll up your wages on a private island, dolo
One across the Cono
Them broads before me was locals,
Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn

Stamped passports where they all pass ports 'til the clocks fast forward
Then we got blue shores where they don't do chores, we just get chauffeured

Damn, this is the life
Exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand,
And they landing on top of foreign mansions

[Hook 4x:]
Imma change your life, Imma change it
Imma change your life (life)

[Verse 2 — T.I.:]
If you could listen more than you speak
I get you everything that you need
I'm talking 'bout red bottoms LV
Even extensions plugs in your weave
I be blowing on strong weed when we ride
And everybody just lookin'
But ain't no nigga gon' holla
They like nah shawty she tooken
Ima get you up out that coffee shop
Pick you up and leave you marked where you wanna shop,
And let me show you that watch you supposed to wear
Get up out that Honda Civic and get your ass in here
Tell your mom and dad you're straight,
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet
Hustle gang got your chest,
Ain't no time for stress

[Iggy Azalea:]
We spend our Winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors
On acres without the neighbors
We fast-forward four years more
We long way from piss-poor,
And all the shit that we endure
I told you what you was in for so

[Hook 4x:]
Imma change your life, Imma change it
Imma change your life (life)

Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could

Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby I could help you make that change
I could show you how to do this thing

Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby I could help you make that change
I can show ya, show ya (show ya, show ya...)

[Hook 4x]

Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could

[Outro:]
Once you go grace, you never go good
Imma change your life, Imma change it
Imma change your life (life)
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
Imma change your life, Imma change it
Imma change your life (life)
