[Kendrick Lamar:]
Said I'm a fuckin monster 
A massive attack will haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that
After that I went for thermometers
Popped them all then popped them in the jar
Tracy veronica holla back
They promise theres no pajamas
Insomnia when attack I attack like pirahana
Theres hit your block like a comet
And you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silence is excersize 
And that trigger strapped
Rock with us Metallica competition 
No talent I'm in the jungle
Loud enough just might stumble
Upon a pack of lions no lying
My soldiers dying
This is like rap alliance is lining with
Stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying
Pressure a stretcher is needed paint prosthese of your living dead
Your stuff is a giga pet
You niggas cant see me unless you watchin that TV 
Ill hold your hug in my silouette 
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit till I feel my breath start stinkin my fuckin chest
She fuckin the fuckin best mean my dick is the dick of death 
Mean I'm killin that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip

Yeah dre
Me and Andre the giant 6’7” and climbin
Whether your storm to your climbin
Whether your beat makin a rhyme and 
Bumpin some feelins huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans
Glasses, palmin’ asses that probably came with a great tan
I’ll be the motherfuckin mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fuckin frogs rectum
While you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible
Probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera barely passin up celicas 
Tellin us about shit
Hiii power in your mouth bitch
And top dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you bout
About face and army outfits the general’s head
Means the hustlers and the criminals there
Pinnotens reach the pinnacle of life in despair
And me I solemnly swear
To handle mine like a taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never asked and I lie for it
Only difference is I be spazzin and still a pow for it
Put me in a category
I don't know whats a sadder story
Guts and glory your pain bore me
You ain't really lived it
I’ll take you to a block where they crippin
A piru that’s 5’2” gun bigger than the torso of pippen
Bitch I been doin it since before you niggas ruined it
Show me something different
You either kissin dick or givin me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies
I know your statistics
Who your bar he more like my assistant
Get lost have an egg and a biscuit
Break-fast when we aimin them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin
Q, Q

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Ahh, double up said what the fuck
Give me some I’ll throw more poppin
Sagrets droppin soon they watchin
9s thats locked and load explode
Druggin ford I'm slowly known
Mary up some swisher sweets
LA nigga probably eats
Shrimp for the ragin beats
XO, henney, scrape the kief 
Bangin c I’ll bang your beat
Put them niggas next to me
Stoppin for them give the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
All them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still I'm ventin 
Air condition coolest breezes, ill diseases 
Grip my pen and shoot my semen
Still I'm coming 
Mouths is runnin
I was learning gettin knowledge
And describin she a goblin
We be mobbin over bitches
Stickin missus she the business
Ghetto witness pussy frenchin
Just a mission poppin off like on a mission
Proposition gettin money drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Cop a head gon bust nigga
Heatin up the winter nigga
Somethin to remember nigga
Hella sick I gotta spit
Curse with a verse like god told me kill this shit
Load a clip hecklin cops
The hoover king
Ba da bing by the dingaling
Natural hoover
Ving rhames with a vision clearer than visene
Asian from bejiing 
Money making compton cream
Feed a weak thats when it stop
Start with rain drops
Autobots, space shuttle I'm shittin on your car lot
Boy stop
Could've at least got a saturn huh
Hiii power see a pattern huh
Puttin on chops like I've never been freed
Toon to the knees still I'm shootin up scenes
Cheese and a nigga thoughts succeed 
Promising scenes ba da bing bing bing
