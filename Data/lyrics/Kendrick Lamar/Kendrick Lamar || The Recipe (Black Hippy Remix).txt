[Ab-Soul]
Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast, E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right), I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off, and they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say, to live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach - I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls

[Schoolboy Q]
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye); women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored 
Come and join the wave (aye); girl, what is your name 
Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout (uh); a little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth, little something on your couch (uh); know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it, she said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise, bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Dr. Dre)]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather (from all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather - don't it sound clever, come and play
Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA

[Kendrick Lamar]
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some
Three W's only for a three day, run
Bitch, take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no, nun (shit)
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I’m wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault, then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that yola, ask (Keisha) she'll confess
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on (No Make Up) (uh)
Medicated, please my nigga no telling where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at the W, she got double D's bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm trying to dive in the (Swimming Pool)
Left stroke, right stroke, whats the best stroke, that stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro, Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga

[Chorus]
