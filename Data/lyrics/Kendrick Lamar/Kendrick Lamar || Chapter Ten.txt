Babies from 80s don't know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of the feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen
I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
On the real
This is your generation
Show, show your pain
