[Kendrick Lamar:] 
Hold up is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school
J-305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit
[3x]
You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv, but no freestyle, I never do
Ya lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti'
Ya overlookin' every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on ya like I'm boutta break a levee (HOL UP!)
That pussy petty
Yeah ya nails did, ya hair did, your cellphone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a hummer her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make ya mine.. (ho)
Tried to make some time.. (ho)
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line.. (ho)
Her dream soap Versace, she fall for Armani
I only deal with rich niggas, fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now, I'm on my own now, I'm poppin'
Change my phone now, when I get home now, I got options
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies same car note that's overdue?
I know

[Gotye - Sample of "Somebody That I Used To Know":]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing... 
[fades out]
