[Intro:]
I wanna hit line drives
Wanna lose weight?
For you
Hey, what's up doc?

[Bridge:]
Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it

[Hook:]
And I run it, yeah BLUH
Yes I run it, BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
I run it, BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
Yes I run it, I run it
Yeah BLUH yeah

[Gunplay:]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, motherfucker, hope y'all amused

I run it BLUH, BLUH, BLUH, BLUH
And I run it BLUH, BLUH, BLUH, BLUH
Yeah Yeah BLUH
Yes I run it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna ride
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks, had nothing that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy delight
Tell a story that I'll never flourish 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see you fully
Young, that's a covenant that I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody go tie your shoe
Nobody grew up by (by) your rule
Nobody horn your gun, how come, your tongue say killer then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Lit a whole leaf, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lighting bolt
Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new Dame, one stripe, and you a zebra look alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun
Do things we'll never learn soon
And the error where we wanna earn soon
That's an error, you can smell it in the air
Everybody really doomed
That's why I backed on you motherfuckers
All ya'll can suck my dick
All them days that the county buildings
I"m bout to make my momma rich
Cartoons and (cereal)
I ain't felt this (good since)
Scrooge McDuck (here we go)
Elementary hood shit

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'm a aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gone flip that car
AK's for the whole hood
House lit went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
Overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Darkwing Duck, lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama hauled in the clutch, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no drum machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everybody corner (dash for it)
Get a toe tag, when you play tac with a task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
Cartoons and cereal

[Intro]

[Gunplay:]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth just for you
Motherfucker hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit got lots to gain
Just another player with lots of game...
Never had shit got lots to gain
