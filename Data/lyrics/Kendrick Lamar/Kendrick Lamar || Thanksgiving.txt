[Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 

[Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I (deliver)
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Chorus]
