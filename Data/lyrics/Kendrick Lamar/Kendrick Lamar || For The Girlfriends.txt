[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Abba Zabba
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best, you know?
Beautiful shit
But this time around I want to do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig'?
Hop on them keys real quick my nig'

[Chorus]
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like

[Kendrick Lamar]
Check me out, she say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick, put it down like this
When I listen I want to close my eyes and feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap/rap around me and grab my hips
So enticing, on point like the helmet of a viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I can get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she want to vent
Now she can talk about her boss and I can give advice
or she can take the panties off and I can eat the pie
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune, you know why?

[Chorus]
This shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like
Ha-ha-ha, yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Abba, this shit my girlfriend will like my nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look, we be in the car bumping my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 P.M.
It's a club banger, catchy hooks and 808s
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first eight bars she loving the track
Even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop
The way she react, she like that's hot
till I start talking how many hoes I got
How many I've fucked, how many I've misled
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch, uh
Though I'm on some cliche rapper shit
I know she thinking all my lyrics, they're accurate
She so cool though
Don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo
She will still play it even though I sound rude yo
and disregards to them provocative records, one thing that I do know

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar (Ab-Soul)]
This something that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend will like
Ne-ma-ne-ma-ne-ma-nem [laughter]
Told you that my girlfriend would like...
... other hoes tonight
'Soul! (This shit my girlfriend will like too, haha)
(Kendrick, I got you)

[Ab-Soul]
This a great idea
This will be girlfriend joint right here
So I'ma kick the shit she like, it seem right
like a pair of jeans that fit tight around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
at the movies, her body-language gets read
like a ruby, cause she a work of art
No help from Julie, I'm a beast and she's such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from a narc but best under cover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
like an iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me, I mean me and her
I mean her and I, it's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me, you know where Herbert is
On her mind like she on mine, uh
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend would write
if she was me talking bout her, DJ...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend would like
Now I'm sure to get some cutty
