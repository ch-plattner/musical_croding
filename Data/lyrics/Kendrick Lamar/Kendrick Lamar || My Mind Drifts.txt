
As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff
I begin to catapult off the cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we’re not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO, I hate y’all but I spread love like mayo
That spreads slugs
My brain matter is a brain fatter
See my vision or my vision’ll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
You copping fitted caps, I’m about to go and cop a halo
rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius
I enter rap with the inner-city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap
