
Man, Beyonce, I'm mad at you, man

[Chorus 1]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
till I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like 'No, no, no', I was like twelve years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you're on the road
You wore braids with a banging body
Looked like you did Pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when LeToya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry, cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserved to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I'm just saying
They cool, but you? You something like Wonder Woman
And I just want to hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eating Hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished

[Chorus 1]

I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
I gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
She's jealous of you B cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
like Ice Cube way before the Mack 10 feud
She like, you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
I said, so, I'm five-hundred mill' away, there's still hope
Anyway, I had feelings way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for taking up for you
I would have stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay shoulda did that, I thought he had your bizzack
What happened Mr. Izzo? Hopico with Frederico?
He used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on 'Ether'

[Chorus 2]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm

I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J. Blige concert
with an 'I Love Mary' shirt, then find Jay-Z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out, Sounwave, hurry up, take the pic
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet I'ma steal his cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit
Like you don't the back of my knees right, so this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger, guess what, I'm throwing it (cling)
You heard the sound, so you know I did
Ha-hahhh, that should get him
I should break 'em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah true that
I'ma put the plot in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never worked

Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don't be mad at me bout this song
Start-, ay Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it'll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nig' got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?
