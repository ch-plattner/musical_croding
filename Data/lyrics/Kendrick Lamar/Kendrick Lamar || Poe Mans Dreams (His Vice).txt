Smoke good, eat good, live good [4X]

I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC' phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right just so you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good [5X]

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Kendrick Lamar]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful, the city got my back
Before that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be
out of work, laid back, while he

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good [5X]

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move, and now that we took it up to the cathedral
cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking bout?
We out here rotating under the five Ps
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking bout?
Doing my thing, cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
from the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking bout? Church is definitely on the move
and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talking bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking bout?
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, chuuch! Ism
