
Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim. 

But like the trees we cut our names in, 
There must be an explanation, 
Guess it didn't given off rain. 
I need reasons why you're leaving 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought was a star. 

Diving off into the deep end, 
Honestly believe you'd be there, 
When I jumped in, 
Is ain't your territory, 
We had the perfect love story, 
except ending. 
Nothing comes true, 
When it comes to you. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

And I was too cloudy, 
It's not my fault I just couldn't see. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought it was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim.
