
Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if i'm alright, 
Think about what i, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and i was right, 

But i can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home and cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
And i know, 
Someday you will...

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed, 

And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 

Written on the back of my hand
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand
