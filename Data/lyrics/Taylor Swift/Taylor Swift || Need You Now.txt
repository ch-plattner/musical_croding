
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
That I’ve come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now

I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you now
And I don’t know where you are
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you cause I don’t need you now

I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say
“I need you I need you”
I don’t need you now

Don’t need you
Don’t need you now
