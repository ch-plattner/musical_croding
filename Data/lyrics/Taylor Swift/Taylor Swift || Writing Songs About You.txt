
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind 
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do, 
I'll keep writing songs about you
