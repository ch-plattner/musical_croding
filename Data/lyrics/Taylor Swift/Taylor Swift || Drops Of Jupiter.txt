[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.

Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
