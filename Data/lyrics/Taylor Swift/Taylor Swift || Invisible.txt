She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by.

And you can’t see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me.

[Chorus:]
I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you,
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through.
She’s never gonna see the light
No matter what you do.

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize.

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you.
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
