[T-Pain:]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}
And T-Pizzle {T-Pizzle}

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth 
And Diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat, whoa oh

[Taylor Swift:]
Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a make ya

[Taylor Swift:]
Straight to the top, yo

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a take ya

[Taylor Swift:]
You can call me T-Sweezy 
Now I'm a rap star

[T-Pain:]
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster

[Taylor Swift:]
You don't want to fight me

[T-Pain:]
Straight to the top

[Taylor Swift:]
In my extra small white tee

[T-Pain:]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!
