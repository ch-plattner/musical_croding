It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day
