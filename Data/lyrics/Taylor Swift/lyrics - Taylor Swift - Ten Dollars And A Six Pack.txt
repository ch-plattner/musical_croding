
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
