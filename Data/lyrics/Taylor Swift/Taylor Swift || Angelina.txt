And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come [?] and purpose she
But I don’t cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
He’s funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not, I’m not oh
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way
