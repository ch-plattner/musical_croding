
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh
