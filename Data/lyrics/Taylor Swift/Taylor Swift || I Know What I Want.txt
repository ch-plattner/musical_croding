
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream

I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Don’t try me
Don’t fight me
You be you and I’ll be me

They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you

Your mum and daddy’s walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

So sorry, don’t worry
I’m sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
And it ain’t you oh

Oh baby, don’t persuade me
I know that you ain’t used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say I’ve always known
What I wanted, it’s true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I get what I want

And they say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
And you’ll will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
