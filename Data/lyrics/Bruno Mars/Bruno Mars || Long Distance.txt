There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time

And I'm running out of things to do
To get you off my mind
Oooh...

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday

With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me

Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days
While I'm away

Ya know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon
Coming home soon

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again
Oh!
With you is where I'd rather be
(Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
(You were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
It's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)

Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)

With you is where I'd rather be
(Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
(You were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, It's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
It's so hard it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me

There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time
