I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shuttup and take it
Look at the monster you created

You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shuttup and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created

Yeah

Killa on the run run run run run run run run

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

Killa on the run [repeated]

Goodbye
[Click-clack]
