[Verse 1:]
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know

I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

Oooh

[Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do

And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose

[Chorus:]
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

[Bridge:]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

[Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
