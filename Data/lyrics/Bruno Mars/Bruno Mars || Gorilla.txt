
Ooh I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down

You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise it's a killer,
You'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You just smile and tell me, "Daddy, it's yours."
'Cause you know how I like it,
You's a dirty little lover

If the neighbors call the cops,
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT â€’ we don't stop,
We keep rocking while they're knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby,
[Clean version:] Give it like you wanna!"
[Explicit version:] Give it to me motherfucker!"

Oh, look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise it's a killer,
You'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you
You [x3]

Oh, you with me baby making love like gorillas

Ooh, yeah
You and me baby we'll be fuckin' like gorillas
Ooh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, baby, baby, oh yeah, yeah)
You and me baby making love like gorillas
