
All you get back, coming to the stage, is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name where your stacks at
This pretty little thing I swear won't let you down
Watch her drop it like... hey

It's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile

Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like... hey

It's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile

Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile

Watch her...

It's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile

Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile
