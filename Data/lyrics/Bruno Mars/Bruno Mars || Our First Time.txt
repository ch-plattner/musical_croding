[Intro: x2]
Don't it feel good babe
Don't it feel good baaby
Cause, it's so brand new babe
It's so brand new baaby.

[Verse 1:]
And now now here we are (here we are)
In this big old empty room
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go, is all the way (ah, whoo)

[Break:]
Is that alright?
Is that okay?
Girl, No need to be nervous
Cause, I, got, you, all, night
Don't you worry bout a thing (no no no)

[Chorus:]
Just go with it, go with it, go with it (and I will go real)
Slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it (and I will go real)
Slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

[Verse 2:]
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooo girl you're my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, oooh girl you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away (babe)

[Break:]
Is that alright?
Is that okay?
Girl, No need to be nervous (no no no, no oooh)
Cause, I (I've), got (got), you (you), all, night
Don't you worry bout a thing (no no no)

[Chorus]

[Intro x2]

Ooooh oooh baaby!

[Chorus]
