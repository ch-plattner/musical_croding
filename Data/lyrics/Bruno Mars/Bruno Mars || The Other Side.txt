Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun

It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like
Until you try

[Chorus:]
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just gotta decide
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for

It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
Until you try

[Chorus]

If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you's would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we living on the other side

[Chorus]

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
