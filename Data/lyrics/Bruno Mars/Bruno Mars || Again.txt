
Hands over my head thinkin' what else could go wrong
Woulda stayed in bed, how can a day be so long

Never believed that things happen for a reason,
But how this turned out removed all my doubt so believe
That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you,
So I'd do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubt
So believe that for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you so I'd do it all over again

Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong could turn out so lovely
Yea, I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldn't change a thing
Yea, yea
I'm a do it
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again

Do it all over again
I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong could turn out so lovely [x2]
