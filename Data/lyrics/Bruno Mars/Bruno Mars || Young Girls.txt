
I spent all my money, bought a big old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honies
Oh, yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

[PRE-CHORUS]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

[CHORUS]
All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death for me, the death for me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like "Everything will be okay"
Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist
When you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

[PRE-CHORUS]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

[CHORUS]
All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death for me, the death for me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

You, you, you,
You, you, you
Yeah, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death for me, the death for me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
