He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby ain't scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare
[x2]

You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true
