It seems like every other night 
You pick a fight..fight
I kind of know i do the the same
Be calling you out your name
This is not what lovers are suppose to do..do

You tell me to go..go
I start walking out..out
When we both know..know 
What we're all about..bout 
We fuss fight and scream 
And its all because of our love 
But you and I both know we never giving up

Everytime I try to leave something tells me to turn around round..round..round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down..down
Cause I know we can work it out,work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Everytime I  try to leave we find a way to figure it out
Thats why I always turn around

Now wait..wait before you say..say 
Something you know you'll take back later on today..day
Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you bay
All I ask is that you always appreciate me

You tell me to go..go
I start walking out..out
When we both know..know 
What we're all about..bout 
We fuss fight and scream 
And its all because I love you
But you and I both know we never giving up

Everytime I try to leave something tells me to turn around round..round..round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down..down 
Cause I know we can work it out,work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Everytime I  try to leave we find a way to figure it out
Thats why I always turn around

Thats why I always turn around for you you you you you you you youuuuu
Aint nobody that can love me like you love me
Thats why i always turn around for you you you you you you you

Everytime I try to leave something tells me to turn around
