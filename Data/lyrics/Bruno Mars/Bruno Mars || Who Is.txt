Oh, I was perfect,
for the circus,
if she dared me I'd do it,
love makes you stupid.
I gave it up, but I guess it was not enough,
cause she never seemed satisfied.

Oooh ooh

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect.
Well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is?

Ooooh oooh Ooooh
Ooooh oooh Ooooh

She set the bar,
just above the stars,
a rocket couldn't reach it,
but i still kept on reaching.
She watched me try,
at least a thousand times.

If she loved me she'd stop me, but noo.

Oooh ooh

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect.
Well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is ?

I saw something worth my future,
So wrong, so wrong.
In my mind I would tell you soon
But I guess I wasn't wrong

Oooh ooh 

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect,
well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is?

Ooooh oooh Ooooh
Ooooh oooh Ooooh
