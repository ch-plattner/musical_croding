[Verse 1]
She wakes up in the morning 
Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion 
While she's wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club 
The way she's showing off to her reflection

[Break]
Every morning I watch her from behind 
But she don't know 
I pretend I'm sleep 
But I don't miss a show

[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day 
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the Mirror
Oh she so cute, cute, cute,
Dancing in the nude, nude, nude
My favorite part of the day is 
When she dance in the Mirror

[Verse 2]
Its late in the evening we've got dinner 
Reservations, she's taking her time
But I don't mind waiting
I don't get impatient cause
When she gets naked Oh the
Temptation (oh the temptation)
You make me wanna cancel all
Of our plans keep you right where you stand
Just wind up seeing you dance

[Break]
Every morning I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm sleep 
But I don't miss a show

[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day 
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the Mirror
Oh she so cute, cute, cute,
Dancing in the nude, nude, nude
My favorite part of the day 
Is when she dance in the Mirror

[Brakdown]
Oh she singing to herself like
Daa da daa da da da da (oh)
Whao she singing to herself like
Daa da daa da da da da (oh)

[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day 
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the Mirror
Oh she so cute, cute, cute,
Dancing in the nude, nude, nude
My favorite part of the day is when she dance in the Mirror
