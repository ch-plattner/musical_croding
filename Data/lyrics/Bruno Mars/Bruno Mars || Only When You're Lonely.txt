
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you wanna call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Cuz I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl 
with no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cuz now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Cuz I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cuz now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
