Well, looky here looky here
Ah what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding

I love you so, hey
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You'll tell me
Baby baby please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play (when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
To every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say:

Run run run away, run away baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get get away get away darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run run away run away baby

Ah yeah
Well, let me think, let me think
Ah what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies

That I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it!
