Eyy-eh-eh-ehh
You said that I was so not afraid
You said that I was just a [?]
But I'm not trying my best to owe it
You told me that I'm not to follow
And you only knew what you do, babe
If you only saw what I was
But I'm not try'na bet this only
Cuz you can't count my own deals on it
Oh I wanna touch ya with the lights on
Oh I wanna freak you with the light-
My lonely girl you're my only girl
This is so not cha fault
You're my only girl (Yeah)
