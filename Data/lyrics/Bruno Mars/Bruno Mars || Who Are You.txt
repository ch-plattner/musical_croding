
You use to tell that you loved me
Yeah that's what you would say 
You use to buy flowers even out on valentines day
You would surprise me with a dinner even though you just ate
But what happened? baby, what happened? 

[Chorus]
We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do 
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go 
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
And I don't recognize you no more 
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh, woah oh. 

You use to look me in my eye but now you just look away
If I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay
Oh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night
I promise, it's gonna be the last time

[Chorus 2]
We've been through some changes 
Like we in different places 
And now you think that you can just do what you do 
Without any consequences 
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do 
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore 
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
And I don't recognize you no more 
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
What happened to the man that you were before? woah 

What 'chu want me to do (do) 
I'm not gun' chase after you (you) 
Tell me how can I get (get) 
Back the man I first met (met)  

[Chorus 3]
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore 
You're just a stranger (don't know you no more)
A stranger and I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?
