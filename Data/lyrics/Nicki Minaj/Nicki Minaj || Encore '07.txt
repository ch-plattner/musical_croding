[Speaking: Nicki Minaj]
Thank you
Thank you for coming out tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for)
New York City (chea)

[Verse 1:]
Who you know fresher than Nick
Riddle me that
Mammi you itty bitty
Can't mirror me back
Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dat
I live and I learn but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run got weight to burn
Ease off the gas then I make the turn
Three off the pass they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill
Why when they see me bitches gotta go ew
Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea)
The rain and the pain
I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game
I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon do
Came out the coup petite with tall boots

[Chorus:]
Can I get a encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls
They're such a bore
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for)
After me there shall be no more
It's my time I need ya'll to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for)

[Verse 2:]
Look what you made me do
Look what I made for you
Knew when I paid my dues
That I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know is that I push a beam
All they sees a pretty face
How I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn)
She was right, she was dead right
How was I to know that would be her last night (last night)
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind
Won't come when I call, but he just in time
So I come when he call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it
Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it

[Sample: Linkin Park]
(Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
As be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Can I get a encore I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar
