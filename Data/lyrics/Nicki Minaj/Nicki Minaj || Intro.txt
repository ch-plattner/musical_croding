
You know, a lot of people ask me
why I feel, that, you know
I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And, umm, I don't know
People seem to be under the impression
that, I made it to this point, FAST
And, y'know obviously for me
I don't feel like that cause it's me y'know
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years
But, every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far
Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten
until you look around and, and you look at the people who
who, who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that, that no matter what, it's
in the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
It's not gonna be about my connections
It's not gonna be about my looks
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most
Annnnd, I want it the most!
