Step your pussy up and all that
Am I forgetting somebody? I'm not forgetting anybody am I?
Oh you know what you're right
Somebody brought the name up
I don't know if they'll even understand
Do they even know this guy, out here in the United States?
Umm, a little dude named, Dwayne Carter
Dwayne Michael Carter, umm, y'know
He runs a label called Young Money Entertainment
And umm, y'know, he's my sensei and I'm the ninja
And umm, I love him very very fuckin much
And umm, y'know, just have to shout him out
Say thank you for EVERYTHING you've done
Y'know cause we're totally 'bout to take the globe by storm
So, umm, I can't wait. Bye! ("HOLIDAY SEASON!!")
