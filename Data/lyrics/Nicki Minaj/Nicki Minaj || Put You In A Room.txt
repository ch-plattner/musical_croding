[Hook x2:]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 1:]
Every time I come to fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Oh, are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Every time I try to fuck with you
Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds
I could be fucking with them other niggas
I know you ain't them other niggas
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches
Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it, you keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off
I ain't gonna lie, no I ain't gonna lie like it was just his fault
But I know if a nigga lose me, then nigga, Oo-ee, that's his loss, young nigga
