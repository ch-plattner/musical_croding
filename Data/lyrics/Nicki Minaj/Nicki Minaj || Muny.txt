[Chorus:]
Oh no we don't play with silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Give me the muny, the cars, the case loads, the mun-mun-muny, the yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
Yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
Yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
Yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, muny, muny

[Verse 1:]
Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation
Top five tax bracket in the population
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why
I ain't got to wonder if I want to lease or buy
And i dictate how I'm gonna piece the pie
I ain't talkin' about no muthafuckin pizza pie
Caus' I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans
Na, homie you gon' need a bigger cock-pit
Caus when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit
(Aye, yo captian, aye yo cap', I, I don't wanna hear that navigation, baby pa'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I'm in the UK but just for one day
Whose to say I won't come back again
Materialistic I'm narcissistic, my shoe game is mean it's so sadistic
I took a learjet to cop some lipstick, yeah I'mma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Ros√© you sip your mistake my flows' a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators, Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson, I'm on the bike doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin', Gucci bag just to put the coke cans in
(Hey, yo, Anna, hey yo Anna Wintour, I'ma need that cover baby girl, it's Pink Friday, ya dig)

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Material, I'm always on that new shit
Material, this shit is exclusive
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)
Material, don't ever get the truth bent
Material, I could get you the blueprint
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)

[Outro:]
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls (girls, girls, girls)
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls
