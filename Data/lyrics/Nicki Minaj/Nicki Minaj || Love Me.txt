I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus
You win, you lose nothing to improve
You on the pedestal hood with no roof
I know that you want it but you're scurred
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl
You don't understand you should be my man
Baby, baby, baby if you let me
I could make you love me

I could be Trinity you could be Neo
I could be the mistress you the CEO
Keep in doin' the leelow in the Matrix
They be on that fake shit, they be on that spaceship like
Like love me honey all them other girls dumby
I'm a young money bunny
Look, look you the only one for me
When the peeps are out of town we in chummy with dumbies
Listen,listen I'm the one they call
When it's 3 seconds left I'm Chris Powell with the ball
Now, now that's nothing but neck
You know the starbucks getting nothing wet
Now come on

I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus
You win, you lose nothing to improve
You on the pedestal hood with no roof
I know that you want it but you're scurred
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl
You don't understand you should be my man
Baby, baby, baby if you let me
I could make you love me

I could be Jada you could be Willy
When you talking shit I say oh you so silly
You could be the wine and I could be Whitley
Make me feel good like Haley and Billy
No it's no the monsters ball but I like to monsterball
Hoppin on the drop then we be shoppin' 'til we cap the mall
Kawasaki then we off for flight
Watch a fight, pussy poppin' on my pepper light
This one's for you, this one's for oh said this one untrue
This one's for the crew, take a swig of the brew this butt's for you

Said I really like it when you come around
Feelings I can't show there's a God I hold it down
I don't mean to be blowing you off
I just gotta make sure when I step I ain't wrong
You be fine as hell I don't wanna play myself
So I act like I really don't care
If you only knew what was really true
Is that I only wanna be with you

I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus
You win, you lose nothing to improve
You on the pedestal hood with no roof
I know that you want it but you're scurred
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl
You don't understand you should be my man
Baby, baby, baby if you let me
I could make you love me
