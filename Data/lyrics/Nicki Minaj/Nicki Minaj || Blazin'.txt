[Chorus]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing, feels like I'm

[Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me,
Had the power to be the best B in the league?
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly, yo
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed but I am the addendum
So where my dawgs at, Randy
Matter of fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
'Cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,
Ah, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha
I'm the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

[Chorus]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

[Kanye West]
Ugh, yeah, ugh, this is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is the greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flying they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think, without makeup you still bad as hell
Imma grab your waist, then Imma grab your face, and
Then Imma taste it, then Imma blaze it
Hello, all my bad girls, this just in yeezy heard the beat
Like he fucked her best friend and she let him back in
And he just did it again, he crazy, he blazing, he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy,
I'm saying too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is a phase, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per', uh
Prada coloured babes
It obvi' we the ishh and I'm rolling with my bricks
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our style's so diff'
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favourite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin'
Nicki, what you think, I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha

[Chorus]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

[Bridge]
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

[Chorus]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
