[Hook:] I gets crazy [x32]

you know..it's like when i feel really crazy, i just get my broom and fly away...i go real real far away.
Young Money.
That's...that's that's just what we do.
Ya know,i mean  we wear straight jackets, and we, we,we, we st-stay ya know in padded rooms.
And ya know, and fly away.

I just came out of the mutherfuckin Old School
Got my Mac notebook with the Pro tools
Yahh Bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad "WOOF WOOF" flyer then a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mid-LA eating Mangos
Keep a couple Pink Toes in my Sandals
Got some Bangles all over my Ankles
Such a Star they say I'm a Star Spangle
Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Banner
I am the Rap Hannah
Mah Mon Montana so fix your Antenna
I keep three hoes, But don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then Reindeer in the Winta (In the Winter)

[Hook:]
I Get Crazy [x4]
I I Get Crazy
I Get Crazy [x4]

[Nicki Minaj:]
So I got a Badd Bitch mentality
Cause I just came from another Galaxy
I be with the President up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office then the Lights Out
Cause I am the Wicked Witch I'm' the Nickster
And I keep a Bad Bitch on my Jickster
But I leave her in a second for a Thicker
Rockstar little mama with a Guitar
I am Nicki El.Em.En.Oh.Winsky
I mean my name Ring Bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker
Tell that Niqga Link her
Cause I'm' looking for some Good Brains from a Thinker

[Hook:]
I Get Crazy [x4]
I I Get Crazy
I Get Crazy [x4]

[Lil Wayne:]
1, 2, 3rd Floor
Hospital Bound
Niqgas is Doors and I knock Niqgas Down
Straight jacket crooked, I hear you Lookin
I promise I'm Hard, And I swear you Pussy
I ain't crazy, No yes I am
Right up in the Coo-Coo nest I land
I'm fly now Eat mah Bird shit
Yeah I'm' crazy, I'm crazy about your Bitch
Wild Animal on mah Bewildered Shixtt
I love Brain so I'm' Looking For a Nerd Bitch
It's' Nicki Minaj, The Superb Witch
And Weezy F. Baby, No Weezy F. Crazy

[Hook:]
I Get Crazy [x4]
I I Get Crazy
I Get Crazy [x4]
