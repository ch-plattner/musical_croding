If this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, There’s some things
I should have said to you
First of all
Every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man I really am proud of you

Second of all I gotta say thanks
You really did alot
For my out of state banks
With that being said
Lets get down to the real
I still don’t understand
What went down with the deal

And I been waiting on you
Just to give me the word
You know, A couple nouns
And a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls
That be flippin’ the bird
Tryna get up out the hood
And get into the ‘burbs

But everything you said
Was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings
Just to wait on you

But what I don’t understand is
Why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready
To get totally behind me
I mean honestly, How could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry
And I’ll always be Hermione

I’ve been lonely
I’ve been waiting for you
I’m pretending that’s all I can do
The love I’m sending
Ain’t making it through to your heart

Dear Wayne
I’m writing another letter cause
You never did respond
It’s been a couple months
See when I speak
I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing
That they gonna hear

But this will be the realest shit
That I ever wrote
You see me falling
Why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up
But now my times up
I swear to God man
I thought you had it lined up

But if the Lord
Had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad
With some metaphors
Knockin’ on a set of doors
Knockin’ on heavens doors

Let’s play a game, Just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Lets act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes
Started running to me
And you was running out of breath
But you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on

You could take your own life
And you’re a sinner, I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you’re reading this letter
I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
If you’re reading this letter
I done pulled the trigger

I’ve been lonely
I’ve been waiting for you
I’m pretending that’s all I can do
The love I’m sending
Ain’t making it through to your heart
