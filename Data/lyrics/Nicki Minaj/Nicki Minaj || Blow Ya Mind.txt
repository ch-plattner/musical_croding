[Chorus:]
She said her name was Nicki, she came to play and her body was sick, yeah
She kill when she walks, so sexy when she talk
Aw, you know she gonna blow ya mind
Okay, Nicki

[Verse 1:]
Did these bitches fall and bump their little heads
I got 'em like, ah, which one of them I'ma dead
Cause when they get sick they start to cough bread
So (cough, cough, cough) just cough up that bread
The body look right, plus we crop heads
The Rolls-Royce Phantom, yup, the drophead
And that just goes to show I'm that bitch
I 26' inched the rims with black lips
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem

Boy, I put this pussy on your chinny, chin, chin hair

[Chorus]

Boy, I put this pussy on your chinny, chin, chin hair

[Chorus]
