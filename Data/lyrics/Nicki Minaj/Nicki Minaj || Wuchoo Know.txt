Chin checker I'm da chin checker

[Verse 1:]
It was a quarter passed 3 when I ran into rell
Didn't forget my keys cause my name ring bells
A lil white tee some addidas with the shells
Tun in the coup oh! shoot broke a nail
Let me let me think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22
And if a bird try to get out of the cage
I bitch down new york times front page
I went to starbucks I wanted to get a frapo
Then had a snapple apple with the capo
That's fendi but that's irrelivent
Threw him a couple benjies now I'm da president
And I'm nicki and nicki so picky
Slick like ricky flow be so icky
Class is finished you'll be home bout 3
So all ya rap bitches what ya'll know bout me

[Chorus:]
What ya know bout me
Whatchu whatchu know bout me
What ya know bout me
Watchau watchu know
They say the girl is a fool the girl get it boppin'
The girl get them crills and the girl get it poppin'
What ya know bout me
Whatchu whatchu know bout me
The girl gettin money alot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin somethin from me

[Verse 2:]
Got some nice titties yes they are pretty
That's how I got the s the 550
That's cause I gets I gets I gets busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me
I'm badder than the dude at the neverland
In a money green coup with a leprechaun
Holla at'em get a four leaf clover
Go go against me guaranteed ya over
Now all the kids sweat nick like a mexican
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan-trum trum trum
Ya slow poke betta run run run my lil coke
And s-m-I-the l-e and ain't one thing they could tell me
Cause I write write write my own shit
I'm the one like I'm the culprit

[Chorus]
