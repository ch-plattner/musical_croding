Ay Yo
Eeny meeny miny mo
I'm p-p-pickin hoes
To pucker up
And kiss my ass under the mistletoe
Yes I am about my cake
Just call me Ana Mae's
I keep a gentlemen
First name Benjamin
Don't mess with Washington
Don't mess with Abrahem
Patty cake, Patty cake
Better get the bakers man
Frosted flakes is on my finger
Fruity Loops is is on my wrist
Fruity Pebble barbie pendant
Don't forget to ice my kiss
Now where my girls at?
That stack money
That young money
That cash money
I walk the red carpet
You clean the red carpet
Go get your Vacuum
Don't you get me started!
