[Nicki Minaj:]
Step up in the party like my name was that bitch
All these haters mad because I’m so established
They know I’m a beast yeah I’m a fucking savage
Haters you can kill yourself
In my space shuttle and I’m not coming down
I’m a stereo and she’s just so monotone
Sometimes it's just me and all my bottles, all alone
I ain’t coming back this time

[Chorus - Will.I.am:]
I can’t believe it
It’s so amazing
This club is heating
This party’s blazin’
I can’t believe it, this beat is banging
I can’t believe it (I can’t believe it, hey)
Hey check it out
Check it out [x10]
Yeah yeah I’m feeling it now
Check it out [x3]

[Will.I.Am:]
Step up in the party like my name was Mr. T
All these hating maggots ain't got nothing on me
Honestly I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki "Willy" you get super O.G.
Hunny’s always rest me cause I’m fly fly fly
Dummies they can’t touch me cause I’m floating sky high
I stay niggerrific you don’t needa ask why
You just got to see with your eyes

[Chorus]

[Will.I.Am]
Check this motherfucker out
It got me in the club, in the club, just rocking like this

[Nicki Minaj]
Da done done
The sun done
Yep the sun done
Came up but we still up in dungeon
Da done done
Yep in London
Competition? Why yes, I would love some
How the fuck they getting mad 'cause they run done
Mad 'cause I’m getting money in abundance
Man I can’t even count all of these hundreds
Duffle bag every time I go to suntrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation just for emphasis
And I don’t sympathize 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put an iron to your face you old wrinkled bitch

[Will.I.Am:]
Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio hotter than a skillet
We in the club making party people holla
Money in the bank means we getting top dollar
I’m a big baller
You a little smaller
Step up to my level need to grow a little taller
I’ma shot caller
Get up off my collar
You are chihuahua I’ma rottweiler

[Chorus]
