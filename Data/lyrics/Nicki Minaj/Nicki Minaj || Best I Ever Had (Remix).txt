
Baby you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever
I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say

[Chorus:]
You the fucking best [x4]
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had [x3]
I said you the fucking best.

[Drake:]
Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I'll be over there
(Yup!)
I be over there
Shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
(Ha!)
And you don't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, "you ain't bringing Drake along?"
You know that I'm working
I'll be there soon as I make it homeeeee
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one they never get confused with cause

[Bridge:]
Baby you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever
I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say

[Chorus:]
You the fucking best [x4]
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had [x3]
I said you the fucking best.

[Nicki Minaj:]
Ayo you the only one that see the real nicki
I can show you chill nicki cause of how you deal with me
And they knock my blocks down you come and you build with me
Even though you real busy he's that fucking real drizzy
It's so amazing I figured out this world is ours for the taking
I figured out that when I go out and those people scream
That some of them are living bi-curiously thru me
That's why I put the s on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm
And I'm a' make you beg cause you look pretty when you begging
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around eleven
So let me put my books down
Excuse me if I look down
Guess I'm a little nervous
When I'm at your service
Look at what you took downnnnnnnnn

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Baby you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it

I swear I could spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down
Every time you hit me up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
I make you beg for it
Until I give it up
You say the same thing every single time

[Chorus:]
You the fucking best [x4]
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had [x3]
I said you the fucking best.

[Drake:]
Sex, love, pain
Baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could prolly sell a blank disc
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the pictures
And niggas will buy it to and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine, paper girl well money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I could make your pussy whistleeee
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
Who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix then you should really get your feen on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yah slot till a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin

[Bridge:]
Baby you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it

Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus:]

You the best I ever had
Best I ever had [x3]
