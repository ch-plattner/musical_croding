
I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slay Goliath with a sling
In this very moment I bring, put it on everything
That I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavy weight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
South side Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters,
Sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that what we done this moment
Will be syndicated, I don't know
This night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive

[Drake:]
When I tell them hoes bow, bow, bow to me
Drop down to your knees
Young Money, the mafia, that's where the love cease
I'm in a Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing Target Practice
All these Bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the C.E.O., 500 degrees
Shout out to the O.V.O. Red wings and Fatigues ah
Niggas wanna be friends,
How coincidental, this was supposed to be ya'll year?
We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed, he ain't even rolled
These niggas be dropping songs
They ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home...Yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki nick getting married today
And all you bitches that be hating
Can catch the bouquet
Ooh, yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a little more, I could hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it
I'm partly surprised
I swear, damn, this one for the books
Man, I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really trying to make it more than what it is
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive

This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive, alive
