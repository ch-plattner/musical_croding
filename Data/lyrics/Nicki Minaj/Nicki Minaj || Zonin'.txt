Pretty lou out in LA
Said when I'm in LA
Then hit up his cell-ay
Cause he got something nice
He wanna put in my belly
He wanna bump and grind
Sorta like R. Kelly

See money ain't a thang
'Cause my doe is like woah
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like yo
Let's make some videos
Get the benny boom crew
I'm hoppin out the rov's
In my jimmy choo shoes

I'm the boss bitch you know
I like to talk shit
I'm heavy in the streets
So you gon' need a forklift
And daddy lemme cum in your mouth
Like the dentist
I'm not the apprentice
Don't finish your sentence

Baby we ain't gotta talk, We could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then baby I'm aget you in the zone
'Cause you think we're all the same
But you're wrong
Just get me some patron
And baby I'ma get you in the zone

Zonin [x6]

Dolce gabani bani
Than I can be your little
Playboy bunny bunny

See you know what I mean we could sip a lil (weed)
Sweatin, heavy breathin
I can tell that you fiendin
See you're already thinkin that
You must be dreamin
Get them strawberries
Bring another whipped cream in

Lemme get ya cup of patron
I'ma get ya in the zone
I don't let the microphone hypnotize me no more
Listen daddy let me jump on
I'ma keep my pumps on
You know it come wrong
Plus my something dumb long

Baby we ain't gotta talk, We could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then baby I'm aget you in the zone
'Cause you think we're all the same
But you're wrong
Just get me some patron
And baby I'ma get you in the zone

Zonin [x6]
Baby I'm about to have you
