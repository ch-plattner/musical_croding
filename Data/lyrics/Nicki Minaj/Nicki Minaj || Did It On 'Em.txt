All these bitches is my sons
And I'm a go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick I would pull it out and piss on 'em
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let those bums blow steam, radiator

That was an earthquake bitch
Shitted on 'em
You got the ground shaking
Man, I just shitted on 'em

Shitted on 'em
Put your number 2's in the air
If you did it on 'em

You must have lost your fucking mind
Shitted on 'em
You must have bumped your fucking head
Man, I just shitted on 'em

Put your number 2's in the air
If you did it on 'em

This stone is flawless, F 1
I keep shooters up top in the F 1
A lot of bad bitches begging me to F 1
But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Those were fresh ones
More talent in my mother fucking left thumb
She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb
You ain't my son, you my motherfucking step son

I don't know what layaway look like
Shitted on 'em
Bitch, I can't even spell welfare
Man, I just shitted on 'em
You got me mistaken with your mother, hoe
Shitted on 'em
Put your number 2's in the air
If you did it on 'em

All these bitches is my sons
And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix
Bitch I get money so I does what I pleases
I live where the motherfucking pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty, disgust me
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the Duff-b
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me (ew)
I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick, I'm a have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I spray you with a germinator
Move back bugs, matter fact
You know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone Nair

Shitted on 'em
Man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Put your number 2's in the air
If you did it on 'em

Shitted on 'em
