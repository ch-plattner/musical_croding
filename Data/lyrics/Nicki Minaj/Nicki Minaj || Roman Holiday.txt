[Hook: Nicki Minaj as Martha Zolanski]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman
You'll be okay
(Stop it mother please)
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
(Get me out of here, mother)
Take a little break, little break
From your silencing
There is so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday (Roman holiday)
A Roman holiday

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
You done, you tight?
You suck at life?
You don't want a round three
You'll suffer twice.
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari
I am the ultimate Svengali
You, You bitches can't even spell that
You, you hoes buggin'
Repel that
Let me tell you this, sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
Cause my flow's so sick
And I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freaking zoo

[Nicki Minaj as Martha Zolanski:]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman
You'll be ok
(Mother stop it please)
You need to know your station, Roman (I cant take it)
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break
From your silencing
There is so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday (leave me alone mother)
Roman holiday (I hate you)
A Roman holiday

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Witch, twitch, bitch!
Motherfucking right, this is World War 6
This right here might make a bitch die
And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry
And if you being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eating
They dying of hunger
Motherfucker I need, who the fuck is this whore
And yes maybe just a touch of tourettes
Get my wigs Terrance go and get my beret

[Nicki Minaj as Martha Zolanski:]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman (Mother your a psychotic lady)
You'll be ok
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
(Get me out of her mother)
Take a little break, little break
From your silencing
There is so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday (Roman holiday)
A Roman holiday

[Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski

Talking about me, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker, to be talking about me
Them bitches must be smokin' a couple of OC
They want the outline, I give them a goatee
God damn, motherfucker, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker, to be talking about me
Them bitches must be smoking a couple of OC
Ha Ba Ba Ba Ga Gum the goatee
