You a bad bitch Ima call you Lassie
Just left the tour last date Tallahasse
Don't mind me
Even witcha GPS couldn't find me
Lookin at this boy Ima call him McDreamy
I was wonderin if he got a good Dick Cheney
Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!

[cassie's part...]

Is that my cue
I'm lookin for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT sc-scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Loui Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him
Thought he was a queen I dr-dr-dragged him
Dodged to the room and whipped out the magnum
Slim, trim, also light skin
Now P-P-Peter put the pipe in
Yes sir I am that bitch
Fuck U Silly like the rabbit
*giggles*
Giddy Up Giddy Up
Now wake Diddy up Diddy up Diddy up
Young Money Nicki
Badboy Cassie
You wanna minaj
Now lets get nasty
