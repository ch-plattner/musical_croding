[Chorus:]
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more and

Your love, your love (yeah) [x4]
Your love, your love [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Yo(yo)
He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim
Wa-wa-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

[Chorus:]
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more and

Your love, your love (yeah) [x4]
Your love, your love [x4]

(yo, yo yo yo)

[Verse 2:]
He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubberband
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam
I mean that nigga must be from tha motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the Sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
"S" on my chest let me get my cape on
He so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Konvict just like Akon
Cuz you know the snitches be puttin a jake on

[Chorus:]
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more and

Your love, your love (yeah) [x4]
Your love, your love [x4]

Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Your Love, your love, your love, your love
Baby, youâ€™re the illest, your love
Your love
