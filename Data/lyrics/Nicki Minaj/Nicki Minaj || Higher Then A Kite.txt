Hello world
Young Mulla baby!!!

[Nicki Minaj]
Murder dem Murder dem aust one word body a third of them'
Kick kick game can't injure Nicki, that's why they nick nick named me Ninja Nicki,
I'm such a yes, and your a no no,
Live with a dragon, and wear a Kimono,
I'm from the Philliphines, badder than Billy Jean,
Is that why I get more head than a gulliten?
Lookin dumb truck, cause you bumbs suck,
Where da arm, where the fXXk is my nun-Chucks,
I'm in Tokyo with the CokekeyO, somebody sleepin in my bed like Nokio,
I'm gettin illa then, poppin a pill again,
I'm on the Island, and I'm lookin for Gillgan,
And where my timberland, O God I'm trembling,
Can't find my keys, but I know I hear'em jingiling,
Your such a Marilyn, Monroe Manson,
I got some heroin, wanna go dancing?,
You at the door? ok
I'm bout to come now
Gettin numb now
Don't let me come down
Sniffin on sum good blow
It's like I'm sniffin on a temple
And I can't come down now
Cause I'm a higher then, higher then, higher then a kite

[Lil Wayne]
YEAH I do wat I does
I come through this bxxxh wrist blue in cause
I'm so five star suwop to the bloods
And before I had a mirrow I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin I knew where I was
Datt datt dirty dirty south see my shoes from the mud
Who can youu trust? Who can you love?
When love kills like they gave cupid a gun
It go (BLAOW)
Like u shooting for fun and sometimes the solution is execution for some,
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one AM in the conclusion is that you loosing the sun
Don't induceing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest I mean the stupidest buzz blunts I get stupid as duh
I swear my dubbies Is uhh fat and just like it you can't get lit
Sxxt don't stink when you shitting in a bank
Let a man run an errand I'm a hit him like aye
Look him in the eye and a nxxxa might blink
Aim at his head and I nxxxa might think (listen)

[Nicki Minaj]
Sniffin on sum good blow

And I can't come down now
Cause I'm a higher, than higher than, higher than a kite
