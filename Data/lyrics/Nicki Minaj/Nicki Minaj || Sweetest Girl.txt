[Intro:]
[Niia]
ah ah ah ah

[Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne)]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
See I'mma tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]
Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

[Niia] She used to be
[Weezy] She used to be the sweetest girl

[Nicki Minaj]
but when a good girl gone she gone forever
and you cant make it rain without the stormy wheather
and its funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
would've never happened if I would've stayed in doors
would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
cause now I'm hot but the credits say I'm just looks
they say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out
cuz when I cum out niggas get their umbrellas out
I take the l cuz I don't wont to see my brother loose
been through it all but i can never fill my mothers shoes
and I don't want a hand out
I just want my ad lipes to get paned out
and I just wanna tell the girl that could feel me
that I just play the card a nigga deal me
see everything I been through could've killed me
that's why there really nothing you could tell me
you see I live for the bill, I die for the bill
but I make sure I read the bi to the bill
and everytime I write I'm persise in my skill.
its more out of life then just ice in your grill
you wanna fuck me blame me
fuck you pay me
this is what you made me (where my money at)
say you want to drape me turn around and rape me 
nawl you ain't mistake me (where my money at)

[Hook - Nicki]

where my-where my money at 
whe-whe-whe-whe-where my money at

where my girls at (hey)
where my girls at (yea)
if they be fronting
then tell them yo where my money at (where my money)
where my money at
where my-where my money at 
whe-whe-whe-whe-where my money at
