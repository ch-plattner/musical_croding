[Nicki Minaj:]
I got a fetish for boys that's pushing them nice toys
A fetish for dem boys that's fresher than altoids
I got a thing for a dude in a fresh pair of Mauri's
If he rocking 'em right then I might let him call me
He put the Prada bag with the Prada heels wid it
The Louis dufflebag had about a mill in it
From here to Trinidad, man I should've been did it
Cause everything I had I just doubled them digits
That's the kinda dude that can roll with the President
Sit up in the Rolls maybe roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi, he love my spaghetti
He let me do my thing he ain't never act petty
If he ringing, I'm dipping, put the ring in my lip and
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think?
Now he spending and tricking, so the chickens is tripping
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Ha ha hahahaha HA!

[Lil Wayne:]
Good Evening New York! [Water crashing against shore sound]
That mean I live by the beach
Sand on the welcome mat
Flyer than a Felt and
Black ties, black rims
Just to help em look good in the summer
My car look better than your woman
My woman look better than your momma
And I don't wanna name or number
Just some brain from her, naw
I ain't came in a Hummer that's a Bentley Marlow on her
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners
I'm a gunner like a hunter with a gun
With a deer right in front 'em
Ima send him two [?]
Let Nina Ross Tongue him
Oh back to the subject
I'm balling without a budget
I'm a big spender
But I ain't done yet
Ima keep that shit running
Like I'm on some [?] son and
On a Sunday
I'm [?] you don't wanna [?]
You do it but I done it
I stun it
I spun it

[Hook:]
That's what my girls say
Errday my birthday
Young Money sipping rosay when we thirstay
Uh huh Okay c'mon
