Shut 'er down, run up into town I'm a have to get the crown, I'm the Youngs Queens
Bitch with the platinum sound, None of ya girls can steal my shine, Fendi brought me to
The game, Now I'm in my prime (yup), stay humble, stay low, stay on the grind
I don't needa a light but I stay in the lime,

[Verse 2:]
Guess what Nicki spit crack like yayo, yup matter fact when I rap

Don't forget the mayo, Words in the street that Nicki don't play doe,
Bitches pop shit but they soft like play dough, gotta lotta banks so she wanna be
Me, I gotta full tank little momma on E, I fly first class overseas on this BB, snapple
In my hand and it's strawberry kiwi, I ain't even make it, and these girls wanna be me
You Mrs. Me too like you always say me me, I'm who they believe in, mami
Don't even, Soon as I put the keys in I switch like seasons, get a couple beats from my
Nigga dough bezy, why would I go hard when this shit is so easy,

[Hook x2]
