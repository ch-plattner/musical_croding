[Shanell]
You watched me fall
Stood over me as I hit the ground
Then he whispered his name in my ear
Such a dark familiar sound

[Shanell - Chorus]
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer

[Nicki Minaj]
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?
Why when I leave you crush my car (?)
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?
Why when I leave you crush my car (?)
mma put on my long poofy skirt

Man I should have known he would do me dirt
So miserable i’ma stomp through the puddle
Cupid’s got a weapon gotta part with the devil
Tell him that i’m done tell him that i’m not here
Hit him with the lamp i’ma hit him with a chair
throw two sign im done with son
slo mo as the bullet raise from the gun.

[Shanell]
I I I I thought I could trust him
But I I I I didn't see it coming
Cos cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer

I should have known
By the way he took my breath away
And the way he held me
Often hurt me
He told me love was pain
I saw the winding road
Spinning out of control
Surrendered to his wrong direction
Now I don't know where to go
Cos cupid's got a gun
Cupid's got a gun
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer

Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer
