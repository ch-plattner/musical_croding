
Zippin, I'm zippin, I'm zippin
Soon as they come out I'm dippin
Big ass closet, I'm trippin
Big booty strippers, I'm tippin
Big ass chain, I'm heavy
And it didn't cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggaz in pocket
Superbowl; Grammys
What a hell of a jammie!
All these bitches my sons
I'ma get 'em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said bitch?; Fuck you, porn star
I don't do shotgun, I be driving my own car
I don't do shots neither, I'm buyin the whole bar
Holy moley, G copped me a Rolly
I ain't catchin the puck
But iced out like a goalie nigga

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train

I travel more than you walkin with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, runnin game to the matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my category
You like a Rav 4, I'm like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man I merc them ads
When I re-up on "Reloaded" I'ma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot, when I'm out I'm spotted
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-n-niggaz on Banshees is speedin
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leanin
Damn, a bitch late for a meetin
N-N-NYPD comin
Bellbock way, we gunnin
Double our engine hummin
Actin a fool, we dumbin

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
N-N-Nintendo and we in the end-zone
I don't give a fuck hoe, like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like? What the fuck it's hittin fo'?
Tell them bitches "Y-y-y-y-you ain't about that life!"

[Sounds of motorcycles speeding by]

[Chorus]
