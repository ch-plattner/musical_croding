[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]
I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch, 
Do you in the bathroom of the Airplane. 
Do you on a balcony, in the Taxi, 
Cause I can't get enough of that thing

[Nick Minaj:]
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom. 
You can tug on my Gesuppies and my Badgley Mischkas. 
I'm a ba ba ba, I'm a bag of fun.
I'm a pro with them balls like AND 1. 
Now lets go, Mexico that's where we next to go. 
Do him like his momma make him eat his vegetables. 
Can call me a stage mom, boy you best ta blow. 
Or you can even call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go". 
You know I'm spoiled lil daddy, stomps the floor. 
We can do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store. 
We can do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan. 
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon. 

[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]
I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch, 
Do you in the bathroom of the Airplane. 
Do you on a balcony, in the Taxi, 
Cause I can't get enough of that thing
Say we can do it anywhere- 
(Crazy places) 
I wanna freak you anywhere-
(Crazy) 
We can do it anywhere- 
(Crazy places) 
I wanna freak you anywhere- 
(Crazy)
