[Verse 1]
I drove for miles 
Just to find
You and find myself
All these screams
All these voices
In my head
You gave me strength
Gave me hope
For a lifetime
I never was satisfied

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up

[Verse 2]
It's not your fault
I'm a bitch
I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast
And I feast
When I conquer
But I'm alone
On my throne
All these riches
I came this way
All this way
Just to say hey

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up

[Bridge]
I'm givin up baby
I'm givin up baby
(feels like I've been driven for miles)
I'm givin up baby
(and I can't seem to silence these voices in my head)
This time won't you save me
(please save me)
This time won't you save me
(please save me)

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
