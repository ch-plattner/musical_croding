Alot of rap niggas be trynna play hard

They call me Nicholas, style defined as ridiculous
I beg your pardon, meet me at da garden
#1 draft, I'm New York's pick & I don't lose like dem dudes on da new york knicks... (check it)
I'm over seas rockin hella capris, in da west indies eatin delacasies... I tel em
Dey want cain like erica... please
Brotha your money young like goverment cheese
Dese broke rappers always rappin bout a pink truck, I'm only happy wen I hopin out da brincks truck
And I don't need a 16, I got a sentence... I goes on a fucka like an entrance
Dese old bitches betta change dey denture, wen I get in da game dey gon play da benches
Fuck your friendship, pay attention
Bitch get at me, I'm a pay my henchmen

And if dey ain't got da gat, dey got da knife on
Your too wack to get up on one of y song
U gotta deal, cause u was givn up da coochie prolly, but I'll arrange one hit like oochie wallie
And u'll be gon to November like Wyclef, I hold wieght & I ain't talkin bout Biceps
I rep Queens like da crown, wen I'm in da town, ask Yung Joc... it's goin down
Kisses to my bitches and my niggas, getta pound

Bitches don't kno da half, like dey flucked at math, give a fuck about a bitch & da clique she with
Unless u doin dem numbaz like arithmetic, young nic.holla bac & turn up my shyt
