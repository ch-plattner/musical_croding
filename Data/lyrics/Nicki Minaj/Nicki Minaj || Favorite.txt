[Verse 1 - Jeremih:]
I don't want no drama
I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed to be a problem
Every time I get around you, babe
I just want you to need me
You might really wanna try me, babe
All I know I want a rider
All I know I want a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah...

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider
You should pull up in that Spider
You should let me hit the mic
And I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter
Let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed
I'm a bad lil bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'mma write ya
You on the road? I'mma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody, that can add to
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen
When you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him."
I just wanna be your vixen
Give you something real wet, to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Hook - Jeremih:]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Verse 3 - Nicki Minaj:]
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, wanna humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Berkin where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Went to Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Hook - Jeremih]

[Outro - Nicki Minaj (Jeremih):]
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know

(You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a ride, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ayy
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite)
You should already know, you should already know

You should already know, you should already know
