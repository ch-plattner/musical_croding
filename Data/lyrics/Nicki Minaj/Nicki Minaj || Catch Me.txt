
Extracurricular, parallel to none,
I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the oh now that's just ridiculous
We could've cleared up all these particulars
That could've been the homicide vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah you was p'd off
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you telling me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the affect they call a snow ball,
Next thing you know I was running down the hall,
Saying, "Please come back, I have given my all."
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all

[Chorus:]
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for ya
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on ya
I'm waiting for you, waiting boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me,
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me

You wanted oh so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me conquer
And maybe I shoulda never taken you from herr
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Could've called back just to say some
I'm a fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doing well, exclamation!
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all

[Chorus:]
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for ya
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on ya
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me
Could you catch me, I am waiting on you to catch me

Oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK
It's, it's whatever you say,
Eh, eh,
It's whatever you say,
Eh, eh,
I am at your disposal.

My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you,
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me
Could you catch me, catch me catch me
Could you catch me I am waiting on you to catch me, catch me catch me
