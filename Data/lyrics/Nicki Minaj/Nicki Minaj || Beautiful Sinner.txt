
South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap Korea and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon

Chu wan me to leave then take it d-down
You see me come out of England at dawn
You say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad Trinidad, my island

I see you in here dancin'
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws
You're perfect in my eyes
And maybe I'm na√Øve for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art

I didn't know that bad could love so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good

Beautiful sinner

I bet you're heart of stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art

I didn't know that bad could love so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good

Beautiful sinner

Maybe you're the master of disguise and you are..
Putting on and you're really the saint, the good one.
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby take me now

Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art

I didn't know that bad could love so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good

Beautiful sinner
