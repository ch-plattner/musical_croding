[Nicki Minaj:]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my play pen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So I think that I'm going in for the taking
Hear through the grape vine that he caking
W-w-we could shoot a movie, he could do the taping
B-b-boom, boom pow, this thing be shaking
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating
('cause I know he got a wife at home)
(But I need just one night alone)
(If he keep playing them kidding games)
(I'm a run away aye, I'm a run away aye aye)

[Chorus:]
I-I-I wanna give you
One last option
I-I-I wanna give you
One last chance
I-If you're looking for the
Main attraction
Just hold on tight and
Let me do my dance
If you want it I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom

[Nicki Minaj:]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
'Cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So I think that he gettin' that Green like Goblin
Hear through the grape vine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, kabang, like Rambo
Boom, boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he could understand my lingo
('cause I know he got a wife at home)
(But I need just one night alone)
(If he keep playing them kidding games)
(I'm a run away aye, I'm a run away aye aye)

[Chorus:]
I-I-I wanna give you
One last option
I-I-I wanna give you
One last chance
I-If you're looking for the
Main attraction
Just hold on tight and
Let me do my dance
If you want it I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom

[Nicki Minaj:]
Boy I'm in this club, slow mo
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you're feeling me from the jump

You got that hot shit, boy ya blessed
Let me feel up on your chest
Flex it, you the man

Come baby lay down, let me stay down
Lemme show you how I run take you to my playground
Come and get this va va voom, voom (whoo-)

[Chorus:]
I-I-I wanna give you
One last option
I-I-I wanna give you
One last chance

Main attraction
Just hold on tight and
Let me do my dance

Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
