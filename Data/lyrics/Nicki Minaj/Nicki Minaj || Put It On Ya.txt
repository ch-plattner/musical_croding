And I'm groovier than stella
I'm flyer than a flier could you get me some repeller
I I mean I need repellet t-t-taste like watermellon
I'm buying if you selling if you lying than I'm telling

I supersize fries and the m is for Minaj
Heard you a dopeboy and I stay around your heart
I got some good pay it could get a nigga shot
So I go get more A's than a leather with the dye

Le-le-let me let me stop
Le-le-let me make it pop
You need some good bucks like you playing hopscotch
So let's go and get the chalk my Naomi Campbell walk
'Cause I'm a bad bitch like bark

Uh Shawty I wanna know if you got hang time
And if you think that you could beat it by a landslide
Don't lie you could see it in my eyes
I got some good cookies and I got some good pie
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
