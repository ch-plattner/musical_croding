[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj]
I guess I went commercial
Just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set though
I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global, yep
Your ad was local
Where we shot it was a lot of different agriculture’s
So I laugh at hopefuls
Nicki pop, only thing that’s pop is my endorsement
I, fuck around I have to go and reinforce the glock

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj]
Is it me or did I just put these rap bitches on the map again
You mad cause I’m at the Grammys with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I’m who you be channeling
Why they never bring your name up at the panel then?
Hottest MC’s, top five!
You need money, I got mine
More knots than Eric from Basketball wives (ya dig?)

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 3 - Nicki Minaj]
I couldn’t do your TV show I needed ten more mill
Not 10 on the back, I need 10 on signing
Give that shit to a washed up, bitch I’m winning
If I had a label I would never sign you hoes
Take bitches to school then I columbine these hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch you washed
All you hoes cryin’: Christopher Bosh

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 4 - Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, now when I tell ‘em it’s Barbie bitch
Yes I really do mean that it’s Barbie bitch
Ask Mattel, they auction my Barbie bitch
Raggedy Ann, could never be a Barbie bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel scraping
I’m out in LA, at the Ice Age taping
I’m chillin’ at the top I got ample time
Bite me, apple sign

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 5 - Lil Wayne]
Kush on my breath, cocaine on my tongue
Eat that pussy make it numb
She can’t feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun
Fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly smoke a blunt
That mean I’m a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch try Yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell ‘em hoe slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi
That’s a Nicki Ménage à Trois
Ha

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Verse 6 - Lil Wayne]
My shit so cold man, it don’t even stink
Destructive ass nigga, watch me break the bank
Weezy F, and the F is for Fill in the blanks
And I say shout out Mack Maine
Back yard bully
And the weed purple like a black girl pussy
Word, middle finger on the trigger
Uh, so that it mean, fuck a nigga

[Hook - Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
B-b-bang, my shit bang it bang bang

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Bang bang-bang, my bitch bang
She bang bang
Well that’s cause my bitch is Nina Ross and
She bang b-bang bang
Bang bang, she go bang, bang
(Bang-bang, bang, bang-bang)
We bang, bang-bang
Bang, b-b-b-bang, bang we blood gang
