
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the World
Now I’m sitting on top of the World
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World

[Verse 1]
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch
That's when everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kids that can’t do no more

[Chorus]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the World
Now I’m sitting on top of the World
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World

[Verse 2]
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops
Cuttin’ school gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They’ll break in your door, might break in your jaw
They’ll bring back a lye if you bring them an O
But what you really ain’t know they airborne for stardom
With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin’
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sargeant
Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em
No heats is on ‘em
Cause grandmamma prayed that he’d leave the corner.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire, 23′s almost higher
Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas that be huggin’ the block
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
I see you without a man, might erase ya son
Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

[Chorus]

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
We winning, winning

Narcotics on the track.
