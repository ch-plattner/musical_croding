Where my str8 jacket at... I'm a psycho
Where dat white blo, y dey copy my flow
If it's not young money, it's a typo
Dere dem lights go, we don't talk to five-o

We don't t-t-talk, talk 2 five-o
Dere dem lights go, we don't talk to five-o
If it's not young money, it's a typo
Dere dem lights go we don't talk to five-o

Young money cycle, st8 jacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn 2 informant
I bring ya 2 ya door step, loose slips, sank ships nigga
So I'm a bring u 2 da bottom of da ocean (uh chuuch)

Coulda killed em with da first and da second weapon
DJ Unk em with da hand, I 2 step and deck em
Den I grab da choppa, blue flame houston reck em
Kick a snitch head thru a goal like David Beckam
Make way, respect em
