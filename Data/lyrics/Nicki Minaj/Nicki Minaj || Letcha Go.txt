[VERSE 1:]
Babe boy you must got nicki twisted
I would've left before but you insisted
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core I gotta leave you
How could you love me and humiliate me
You ain't my man don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me
A lil bitch when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days
From the slum to the runway
Runs in the hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say
At night I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
Cause when they said it I said creep on who
No not my boo
Ain't what he gon do

[CHORUS:]
Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

[VERSE 2:]
Why you saying you ain't feel her
You was in the villa
She was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin on a miller
My bitch pam had the hidden cam like killa
Funny how ya win some
Ya lose some
Never worry where your income would come from
Cause no matter where you was I held you down
Up north to uptown
So how you sound
Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes
If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak
Strick nine one time in your welchs grape
Quit lying
Why you lying
I watched the tape
Now get up out my dressing room
Give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned
Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn
To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl

[CHORUS:]
Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
