
Feel the beat at the drum
Move like you really wanna be number one
You could beat out the comp
Run like you really wanna be at the top
Stop, adrenaline rush cause
You have been identified as a hustler
Topic of discussion repeat it like a percussion
Chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love

Damn diggity dog
Let them bums stay mad cause we're living it up
Shelve tops is on
And I'm popping, like I'm popping
Like a popping some corn

And now, I don't wanna take you
If we fall down
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow

Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right, now, it's something you can create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah baby this is your day
It's time to masquerade

Bass bass
Feel the bass in your face
Hit the finish line
First place in the race
Yes, king kong on your chest
Running and I'm coming up
Baton to your left
Yup, you could be who you want
You could be who you is
Never be who you aren't
Never ever fold under pressure
Desperate times, get desperate measure

Damn diggity dog
Let them bums stay mad cause we're living it up
Shelve tops is on
And I'm popping, like I'm popping
Like a popping some corn

And now, I don't wanna take you
If we fall down
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow

Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right, now, it's something you can create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah baby this is your day
It's time to masquerade

Imma call you afro cause you're never bald
Fuck all you bitches and I'll never call
Next day, suck my teste
I ain't playing games
Bitch but check mate
Breaker 1 9 [x3]
All my party people let me see ya one time

Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Right, now, it's something you can create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah baby this is your day
It's time to masquerade
Right now
