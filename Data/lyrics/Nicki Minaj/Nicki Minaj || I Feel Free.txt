[Ricky Blaze:]
I feel free.
I'm rollin with my niggas and we jus bought the bar.
I feel free.
Shawty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star.
I feel free.
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right.
I feel free.
Most of all 'cause I got life.
I feel free.

Send 3 more bottles to table 5.
We buyin' out the bar, we livin' out life.
We gettin' all right, shawties watchin' us.
We like another club 'cause we straight dangerous.
Me and my dudes, me and my crew.
We lockin' this down, ices so good.
??
We shuttin' this b- down.

I feel free.
I'm rollin with my niggas an we jus bought the bar.
I feel free.
Shawty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star.
I feel free.
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right.
I feel free.
Most of all 'cause I got life.
I feel free.

[Ron Browz:]
I just signed the deal so everything is all good.
Made a mood and get my n- out the hood.
Same place where Murda Mace once stood.
Ferrari cars interior all wood.
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me.
Lui Vuitton ? , models on me.
Heavy chains, nuttin' hollow on me.
I'm a star now, all the problems on me.
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her.
I Don't care what chew say, I'm cuffin' her.
She's hot, nigga can't get enough of her.
N- champaign, I can't stop touchin' her.
Her pretty eyes is killin' me, her glossy lips is stealin' me.
After the club Ma, we can chill in the V.
Tonight is our night and Ma, I feel free.

[Nicki Minaj:]
Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad

You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free

I'm free [x3]

[Chorus:]
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shorty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all 'cause I got life
I feel free
