[Nicki talking]
Yo, SB. I think it's my time... 
You know why? My tears have dried, 
And I know that no weapon formed 
Against me will prosper. And I truly 
Believe that my haters are my motivators. 
Young Money. 

[Chorus] 
If you could you would get rid of me, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? 
But I won't let you get to me (to me) 
You should already figure I'ma go hard. 
If you was as real as me you would never 
Let another girl sit in yo throne. 
I done put the choke hold on now 
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" 
I am, I'm Still the one to beat. 
Ain't in a rush from these streets 
I am the streets. I am gettin it in until the end 
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! 

[Verse 1 - Nicki] 
Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie 
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie. 
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells bitch buzz me in 
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian. 
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine.
Hit em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby 
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda 
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar. 
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up. 
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up. 
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner, bitches like nelly and kelly got a dilemma 
These birds all fly south in the winter, fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner? 
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle 
Skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle. I'm a bad bitch no muzzle. (no muzzle). 
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja, 
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks 
I'll have the rap bitches for dinner. 
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis 
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki 
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasakis 
Shout out to the back east salt fish ackes 
kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky. 
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky. 
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski. 
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed. 
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.) 
OOhhh! 

[Chorus] 
If you could you would get rid of me, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? 
But I won't let you get to me (to me) 
You should already figure I'ma go hard. 
If you was as real as me you would never 
Let another girl sit in yo throne. 
I done put the choke on now 
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" 
I am, I will, I gots to win. 
I'm still lookin around for my 
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end 
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! 

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne] 
From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder. 
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water. 
Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say shit 
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun 
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip. 
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship 
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick 
And me, I'm that nasty son of a bitch. 
I still got that bitch cum on my lips 
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip 
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip 
I wear that metal, no olympic, but I can still 
Make you tumble and flip 
You fuckin wit me if you fuckin wit Nick 
They ain't fuckin wit me ,they ain't fuckin wit Nick 
Your girlfriend and she just split 
Cuz she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick 
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick, as long as she be fuckin rich 
That's why I keep my luggage cuz, I swear yall's a fuckin trip. 
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger is just punching bitch 
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich" 
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit 
Red drank, blue pill, white dust 
Yes I love my country bitch. 

([Wayne:] yeah!... guitar.) 

[Chorus] 

Wish you could get rid of Young Money, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? 
But I won't let you get to me (to me) 
You should already figure I'ma go hard. 
If you was as real as me you would never 
Let another girl sit in yo throne. 
I done put the choke on now 
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" 
I am, I will, I gots to win. 
I'm still lookin around for my 
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end 
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD!
