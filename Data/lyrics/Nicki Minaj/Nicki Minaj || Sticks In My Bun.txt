[Chorus:]
I done put two sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm D-M-C like Run
Listen mami I'm the muthafuckin one

[Verse:]
You don't like me you just like my flow
Just booked a show but I might not go
Nigga said he didn't have a pole for my hoe
Damn why a nigga tryna fuck up my dough
When it come to me it be like they go
They tell me to stop but I'm like hell no
Now everybody watch my M-O
Nicki been hot since you rock shell tops
Yessir

Ha ha ha ha
Gotta laugh at that
Bitch give me the ball I'm a pass it back
Spit nothin but crack got bags of that
When it come to rap I master that

[Chorus:]
I done put two sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm D-M-C like Run
Listen mami I'm the muthafuckin one
I done put two sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm D-M-C like Run
Listen mami I'm the muthafuckin one

[Verse:]
You can spot me from a mile away
Nicki sexy any time of day
Word on the street is that I'm chinese
No lil mama I'm just high off haze
Don't fuck a dude if a dude don't pay
Don't suck a dude if a dude dirty
When it come to you gotta look purty
Sit up in the groove get your weave curly, hey
Sim simma
Pass me the keys to my beemer
Wish I had a booty like Trina
Nigga get your green up
Stay in the sky like Nina
Flights to Japan, Tiran and Korea

[Chorus:]
I done put two sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm D-M-C like Run
Listen mami I'm the muthafuckin one
I done put two sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm D-M-C like Run
Listen mami I'm the muthafuckin one
