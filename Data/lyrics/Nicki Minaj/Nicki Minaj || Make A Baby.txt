If you get lost boy
Then I will find you
You'll be my rock boy
and I will climb you
But you don't notice me
It's like I'm not even here

I see you in the A
I see you in the bay
I see you everyday
But I don't know what to say
So I'll be at the ball
Till 12 'o clock ay
I'll be your conderella ella ay

Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe we m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me and we
Can make a baby let's make a baby

Let's make a baby, l-l-lets make a baby [x4]

I'll be your sun boy
And I will guide you
You'll be my wave
And I'll always ride you
And I'll give anything
To prove that I really care

I see you in the A
I see you in the bay
I see you everyday
But I don't know what to say
So I'll be at the ball
Till 12 'o clock ay
I'll be your conderella ella ay

Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe we m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me and we
Can make a baby let's make a baby

Let's make a baby, l-l-lets make a baby [x4]

When they seen a girl stuntin'
They thought that I was frontin
I'm not Kanye but you can't tell me nothin
I been around the world from London to Japan
I'm on the l-l-lair, L-l-lookin' for my man
'Cause ohh he's so gudda
He m-m-makes me stutter
The french vanilla trucks
Inside peanut butter
The girls wanna see him
The boys wanna be him
Get paid like perdium, from the am till the pm
So where the fucks the flashlight
Where are my binoculars
Somebody go tell him I get wetter than talapias
And I am bipopulars, Oops I mean bipolar
Search the whole solar
Ain't a bitch colder

Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe we m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me and we
Can make a baby let's make a baby

Let's make a baby, l-l-lets make a baby [x4]
