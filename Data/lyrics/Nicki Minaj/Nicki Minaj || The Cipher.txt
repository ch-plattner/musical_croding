Call Me Darcula cause all i do is count chips 
ya money minnie I aint talkin bout the mouse trick 
These girls runnin like i jus threw da bouquet 
They know I'm Headed to the top lik a 2pay 

Now all the bums be wonderin where I beez at 
If you aint a BARBIE its none of ya freakin beezwax! 
These little rappers I could see dem in my dash cam 
I know they grouchy like oscar up out the trash can 

Im on stage you can sit the crowd 
I be up in leer jets make a left at the cloud (Ha-Ha)
I Think she need the helomlic she the chockin kind 
She gets no burn no smokin sign (CHA)
Metaphor heaven 
So they approve Nicki like my credit score seven 
Mac'n'cheese six fry chicken da guts 
And Im killin dese bxtchez mike vickin it UP!!
