
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it

This is for the little girls that say ,Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act all sadiddy
You be all on the block or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up and don't come to the hood
And how they raise their nose up like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight till it's time for picture
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bus, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can't do no more

I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it

This is for my lil homies that be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes they be passing their digits
Carry up on the block getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school getting off whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough might break your jaw
They'll bring back a lot if you bring them an o
But what you really ain't know they airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter they can't turn no dodge
No matter the scauldron lieutenant or sergent
Aitforce the army airforce in army
For tits is on em no heat is on em
'Cause grand mama prayed that he'd leave the corner

I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it

I remember when I was everything in the fire
I know I got fire 23's on my tire
Shout out to my brothers Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah my money getting higher
One time for my niggas that be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas that be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls that pushing their own ride
Still she ain't no ride 'cause bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad when I blaze the gun
I see you without a man might erased your sun
But look when you blow up everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody on the coma

I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it
