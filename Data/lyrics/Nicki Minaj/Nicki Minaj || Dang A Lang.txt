I Mean You Know Just Juggle Your Balls Like The Ringalin Brothers
I'm The Harajukku Barbie I Ain't Tripping On Your Chain
I Mean Look I Got The Sports Package On My Range
I Just Dip In The Pink For The Pink Effect
D-Diamonds On My Neck For The Link Effect
And I Was Wondering If I Can Lip sync on that
You Know My Name Rings
Ring Tinkle Bells
WaWatch (Check)
Chain (Check)
They Be On A Rain Check
I Be On The Move
They Be Reaching But They Can't Catch
I Be With The Baddest Bitch
On The Island Styling
Black Miley cyrus Saying Hi To Pirates
I Be Singing Them Ballads
When He Tossing My Salad
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is
Colorful Carrots
I Be Singing Them Ballads
When He Tossing My Salad
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is
Colorful Carrots
Oh!
