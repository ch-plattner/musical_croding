[Talking:]
Welcome to Star Box
Yeah shawty I'm tryna get me some thick thighs and some chinky eyes.
I need a real good box
Oh ok
A real good box.
Okay, aye yo Nick!
Yo?
Yeah shawty out here want umm a #3
Oh, alright tell him to come around to my window, I got him it's nuffin.
Oh alright.
And yo you know the slogan right?
Yeah, I know how it go
Pussy by any means.

[Chorus:]
First I take they order at the Cuchi Shop
Then I send 'em a girl that can make her coochie pop
And then I smuggle all my money through the ? spot
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam.)

And there ain't no returns at the Cuchi Shop
We don't wanna hear it burns at the Cuchi Shop
Just listen and you'll learn at the Cuchi Shop.
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam.)

[Verse 1:]
What you need thick thighs and some chinky eyes?
Super size all your sides like your biggie fries.
For a better prize you can get some better pie
Strawberry, apple, cherry even lemon lime.
What you want them B cups or them C cups?
For your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups?
French vanilla threesomes that come in D cups
They eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much.
I'm bout that fast money, money ain't got no patience.
But if them boys come run like you on probation
Listen up, I'm a send ya to the location
Write it down, take a picture, make a notation.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Relax lil nigga cut the bull (cut it out)
We tax niggas no deductible (get it out)
So what it is? What it ain't? Nigga state ya name.
You know we got them umbrellas if ya make it rain.
So what you want them good girls or them bad ones?
I got them girls make ya wish ya never had none.
Cause you'll be spending beaucoup in my spot shawty.
This nigga acting brand new like he just bout it.
Up and away like Mighty Mouse
You can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss
Cause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam
You getting it? I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam,
I'm the madam!

[Chorus]
