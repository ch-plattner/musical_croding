[Nicki Minaj:]
Oh I Get, Oh Okay
Niggas tryna, niggas tryna, tryna be on some slick shit
How you gone do a freaky girl song and not include Nicki Minaj
I mean come on now you no my fuckin name (let's get it)

[Gucci Mane:]
She's a very freaky girl don't bring her to momma
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'

She's a very freaky girl she get it from her momma
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'

[Nicki Minaj:]
You wanna a freaky girl, welcome to Nicki world,

Umm let me think, what can I do to kick it off
How bout I cum all on your dick and then I lick it off...
I mean sumthin so funny when it get soft,
I lyk to play witt it, squeeze it lyk a stress ball
He said he lyk to hear the sound of me slurpin it,
Turn off his phone cause' them hoes keep chirpin it
Tell me that I got the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it I can be his O' Girl,
Fuck I look lyk turnin down sum head,
I mean dats sorta lyk a bird turnin down sum bread,
You can eat it lyk a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet,
I'm a freak I love to beat,
Juss don't get none in my sheets
But everytime I pop the coochi Gucci start choking (and)
Now I'm kinda scurred I got a feelin Gucci stalkin me
Sex game kinky, niggas call me pinky
Fuck a president, I am Nicki Lawintzky

[Gucci Mane:]
Very freaky girl don't bring her to momma
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'
Then you get some brain in da' front seat of the humma'

[Lil' Kim:]
I'm a very freaky girl, very freaky girl girl,

Coochie ova flowin lyk sumbody let the fosset run
Bust one nut I ain't done I got more to cum

Chew on me lyk sum bubblegum, I lick it lyk a lollipop
Once u taste my honey bun

You kno pain is pleasure, can u make shed a tear
Smack my ass, grab my neck got em cumin everywhere

Now he callin me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin me on shoppin sprees, he wanna buy me Gucci
Zoomin lyk I'm Boosie on the back of his Suzuki
And I ain't even sex him all I did was let him eat my fuckin coochie
