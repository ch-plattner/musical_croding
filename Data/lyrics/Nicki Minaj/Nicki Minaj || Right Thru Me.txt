[CHORUS:]
You see right through me how do you do that shit [3X]
How do you [5X]

You let me win, you let me ride, you let me rock,
you let me slide and when they looking,
you let me hide, defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated but looking back,
it made me greater, you always told me,
forget the haters just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it, down to a science, why am I trying,
Know you ain't buying, I try to fight it, back with defiance,
you make me laugh, you make me hoarse from yelling at you,
and getting at you, picking up dishes, throwing em at you,
why are you speaking when no one asked you.

[CHORUS 2X]

What are we doing, could you see through me,
cause you say Nicki and I say who me?
and you say no you, and I say screw you,
then you start dressing and you start leaving,
and I start crying, and I start screaming,
the heavy breathin', but, what's the reason,
always get the reaction you wanted,
I'm actually fronting, I'm asking you something
YO, answer this question, class is in session,
tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,
capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,
OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,
you knew my hand, you can turn a free throw to a goal,
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

[CHORUS 2X]

Stop!
Stop!
Won't you just stop looking through me 'cause I can't take it, no I can't take it

[CHORUS]
