Ayo Corey, Listen man, If there's one thing I can't stand
It's you know these nondescripts
Acting like they don't know who the hell I am
You know what I mean, So that's why I gotta run down
I'm Nicki Minaj Nicki Lewinski, The black Hannah Montana
When I do it it get done (done done)

You must not know who I am
I don't get the spot 'till 2am
Don't be mad lil mama cause you not in
Everybody wanna roll with the crew I'm in
Look

They wanna know why I'm posted at the bar
I tell them I'm just signing posters at the bar
But really y'all know why I'm posted at the bar
Y'all bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar

I get cake 'cus I always got a hustle
I prompt weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout muscle
Club everyday but that ho ain't me
Cause I be home with the scale like do-ray-me

I mean I walk like Onami, I mean Naomi
I keep the thing on me
And you know it ain't a bitch that's got a thing on me
That's why he wanna go and put a ring on me

He be like, Oh God girl you bad
He be like, Oh God girl you bad
I be like, a million here a million there there
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair

You must not know who I be
On my way to ti chi of the l.i.e
Don't be mad cause you not a ninja like me
Think she badder than Nicki thats a l.i.e
Bitches know I'm half gone, I got my skii mask on
You bitches is too busy getting T-bagged on

When I do it, it get done, two sticks in my bun
Pull up in the 6hun, They be fixin the run
Corset Louis Vuitton it be up in my boobs
I just left petite Vuitton let me buckle my shoes

Hold on lil daddy let me fix my soup
I got that presidential cooch
When he see it he salute
I am the mistress, Stay with a rasta
If you get at him, I'll turn your brain into pasta
In spaceships yep we came in with NASA
Even out in Mars we the stars, Oh my god

They be like, Oh God girl you bad
They be like, Oh God girl you bad
We be like, a million here a million there there
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair

You must not know who I are
Sucka sucka mc's call me siyar
I'm the ninja my adlibs say hi-ya
Konichiwa sayonara
Listen, I am the girl, The girl they call Nicki
I am young Nicki and Nicki so picky

And I am like Jada, Halle and Kimora
No I'm not in church but this is Christian Dior
I'm not impressed, I'm not impressed with you
I'mma need alot of cheese and some mustard too

Cause I get more green then the vegetable
They say I'm rude, Yeah I'm rude like huxtable
I mean Rudy, I'm tutti fruity
And I got some good cookies so they blew it and took it
I'm so Marylin Monroe
When the wind blow I'm Marylin Monroe

They be like, Oh God girl you bad
They be like, Oh God girl you bad
We be like a million here a million there there
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair
