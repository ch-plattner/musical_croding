[Chorus]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher (going up in flames)

Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swim in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like what you doing Nicki? Branding
Suck a cockpit prepare for landing
I'm branding, I ain't talking about Presley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed be?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'ma violate your asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint Tropez on a big boat
On my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out in case you bitches get a slick throat

[Chorus]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher (going up in flames)

Won another round, willing get the ref
Got the clothing line popping and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfucking Queen 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chilling with executives
Check the charts,
All my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though
All you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation
So it's off with your head decapitation
Send em up in flames like a firemen
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk,
I live it
And I'm calling a travel
If you don't stay on your pivot, bitches

[Chorus]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher (Going up in flames)
