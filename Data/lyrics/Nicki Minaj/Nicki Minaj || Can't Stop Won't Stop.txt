Good morning New York,
Good afternoon New Orleans,
Goodnight America,
This Is Young Money...Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
They don't make us to break us, no I'm with the bakers
I'm gettin' bread with dread up in Jamaica
It's them young stunners, Nick and Lil Weezy
Nick, I'm the chick that go getta like Jeezy
Fall back 'cause I do this here
Step your bars up or you're through this year
Yep, it's only right that the whole block's there
Hopped out the air in the blue and white Lear
I'm here, I'm lit, long hair, don't care
Steady starin' at my ear, 'cause my ear on glare
Now it's not hard to find me, top behind me
You be Harry Potter and I'll be Hermione
I'll be early, I'm the girl they
Call the one like I'm my first birthday
I'm in that Range Rov, rockin' that kango
That pussy real good, it tastes like mango

[Hook]
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we
We get down and we, we get down and we
Boys they, boys they love me
[Dj Scratched] (Chromed out Eleven Hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we
We get down and we, we get down and we
Boys they, boys they love me

[Hook]
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we
We get down and we, we get down and we
Boys they, boys they love me
[Dj Scratched] (Chromed out Eleven Hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we
We get down and we, we get down and we
Boys they, boys they love me

I'm on tour 'til my money's like the bus height
Ice lookin' bright, see me comin' like bus lights, Weezy!

(Nicki Minaj...)
(Young Money...)
(Fuck with me Fendi)
