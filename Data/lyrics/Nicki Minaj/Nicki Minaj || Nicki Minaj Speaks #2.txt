
Okay so I'm just, y'know
briefly run down my shoutouts, um
Shoutout to all of the deejays
that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love
I love you right back, um
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, y'know
just cause he has really nice eyes
and y'know he's really sexy and all that
Um, shout out to, my baby Big Mike
and Trapaholics, and, um
Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama
Um, I also have a very crazy manager
Her name is Debra Anthony
And um, she's psychotic, she's bi-polar, um
but nevertheless she's mine, ALL MINE
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane
and I have to share her with, OJ Da Juice
and I have to share her with the So Icey boys
and, y'know Waka Flocka Flame and all that but
y'know she's all mine anyway [echoes]
