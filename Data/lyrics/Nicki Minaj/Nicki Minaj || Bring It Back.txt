I don get to the spot till 2 am
Don't be mad lil mama cuz you not in
Errbody wanna roll with the crew I'm in
They wanna know why I'm posted at the bar
I tell 'em that I'm just singing posters at the bar
But really, I on know why I'm posted at the bar
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar

I get cake cuz I always got a hustle
I pump weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout my muscles
At the club every day but that hoe ain't me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back
When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

I hate a dude that be actin' like he get dough
But you know money short like Sisco
Actin' like he got funds for days
Tryna act like a man, yeah the one with dame
I hate a dude with a mad bling-a-bling
That shit don't make up for no wack ding-a-ling
I hate a dude that be pushin' a Benz
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends

Nigga please, what the fuck you done for me
Say you're under company but can't have company
I guess the Lord jus' be tryna humble me
How the fuck you eatin' tuna and its not bumblebee

When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back
When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

I hate a girl that be stuntin' in the game
Iced out chain with a best friend name
Cuz them the girls that be swervin' in my lane
Why they lookin' for change in they boyfriend Range
I hate a clown touch down to my town
When the cheque comes she short like bust down
I hate a girl stay singin' in public
Everywhere I got they be singin' some dumb shit

Fuck her gettin' a deal, I had one too
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that's my boo
It make you mad when they front like they right
They need help like they only got 5 on it

When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back
When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back
When I step up in the spa that's a rap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
