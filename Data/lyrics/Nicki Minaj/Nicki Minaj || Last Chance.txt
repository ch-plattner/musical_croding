[Nicki: Verse 1]
I could've been had fame, jump shot with a stupid ass aim
Caus' you couldn't get around the last name, so my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill right, switched up the flow but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah I still might Imma just do me when it feel right
You could bring it anyday, natural bad ass NBA
Thats my initials, thats why officials don't blow the whistle, bang, bang, the pistol
And I'm bossy, can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn the flow nasty, coffee don't you do like the pope and cross me

[Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki: Chorus]
Yeah this is my last chance, last chance
Yeah this is my last chance
And shoot, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)
And I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

[Nicki: Verse 2]
I get it in though, no sexueal innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on, until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches, p-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll, pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savy, similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this my flow's a crisis they screamin high pitch
Gun cock, pause, and I'm well away of the gun, yours
Tell 'em that I'm willing for the top Forbes, headed to the top, dot, org

[Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki: Chorus]

[Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki: Hook]
All the days of my life, I have been waiting for this time
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes
Anybody trying to stop me, better not fuck with me this time
Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky

[Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki: Chorus]
Yeah this is my last chance (this is your last chance), last chance
Yeah this is my last chance
And shoot, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot
Only one chance one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)
This is my life and I only got one yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Saftey's off and I put it on stun (I'm ready to shoot)
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
