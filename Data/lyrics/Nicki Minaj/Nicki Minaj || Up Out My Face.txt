[Rap 1:]
Mariah
I was in the million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away, well the mice will play
Lol smiley face, Have a nice a-day
Cause pop-pop-pop it goes my rubber band
So stop-stop-stop sa-niffin' that contraband
Cause you was penny pinchin'
My account's laced
Attention, about face

[Rap 2:]
Stylin' on 'em, big B's brought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the Penthouse
Cop those then we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose
They be like she next, Kawasaki T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left
Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on it
Vroom vroom, with the pickup truck
That blue and yellow, yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave 'em, hit him with that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in a yellow bag
