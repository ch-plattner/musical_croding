[Verse 1]
Why is that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurting me
I could say I’m done with it, but it lurks in me
So I’m a just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces
Yeah, that’ll make me transform to Hercules

[Chorus]
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I’m a fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I’ll be twice as bold
So, do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not it’s just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin’ twice to just breathe
Then you say I won’t survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It’s a joke, it’s a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed
I’m a woman, hear me roar

It’s a joke, it’s a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed
I’m a woman, hear me roar

Now it’s a joke, it’s a game,
Why am i still keeping score?
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed
I’m a woman, hear me roar

It’s a joke, it’s a game,
Why am i still keeping score?
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed
I’m a woman, hear me roar
