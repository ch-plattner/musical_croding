[Talking:]
Nicki minaj, dirty money, I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm about to master these bitches man

[Verse:]
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to calli
Used to push a pink dinali, now it's chevi impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys, now I get my work it out like biggidy bally
I sed to go hard, used cop the brim
Used to take the dolla car, used to shop at vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean cover girl wen I say "easy breezy"
Jimeny cricket, let the master in, when it come to bad bitches I'm the last at kin
I'm bringin S.E.X.Y. B.A.C.K. if nicki ain't the best suck a D.I.C.K.
I'm young nicolas, my style rediculous
I herd your money funny, well mommy I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack I guess I'm a crack addict

[Talking:]
I don't know man, I think these bitches is real scared right now, like dam I got these bitches shaking in they boots man,
Dirty money, ayo pri, bring the next verse in my nigga

[Verse:]
I used to make a dollar stretch like a pilati, now I gotta play the potty n it's up in ginadi
Gotta push the masserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate me I'm like one of a kind
They think I'm making fun of them when I b like nahh nahh nah nah
Thas the track lil mama look nahh nahh nah nah
Do wat I do it, like I do it for the tv
Bitches must be blind cause these bitches can see me
Do it all for gp, tell em to suck a pee pee
Monday LA tuesday I'm in DC
Get a ticket or u only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics lil mama I can dig it
I show u how I do it
What do s really magic
Abra cadab tricks are for kids silly rabbit
