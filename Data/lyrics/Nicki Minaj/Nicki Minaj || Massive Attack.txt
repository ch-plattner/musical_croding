[Nicki Minaj]
It’s Barbie (barbie, barbie, barbie)

[Sean Garrett]
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla

[Nicki Minaj]
Tom-tom like in Lebanon
Hotter than in Pakistan
Click click click Young Nick the atomic bomb
yeah, see ya then you lick ya tongue, bet that
It tastes good getcha some
Wicked, got ten bad bitches
We sh sh shut it down
Now the club got glitches, dig it?
and while you do that GT's pullin up
yeah, spaceship E.T's in the cut, yeah
Pop a bottle just to get my head right
Tell the doctor go and get my med's right
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
If we didn't return with a big rocket launcher

[Sean Garrett - Chorus:]
Massive attack, mm Massive attack
Got the bomb bombs make the whole club go back, eeeh
Bend the knees, jig em bring this one back back, eeeh
like a swagger mum, bring on this track, eh
Massive attack, mm Massive attack
What's the numba mean, no more say that's that eh
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night until we see the sun

[Nicki Minaj]
So, so hot in here it feels like a jungle (yeah)
Me don't like boys that ain't Jumbo (yeah)
One time bust a shot for my champion girls,
tell 'em guys super size me a combo
Know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Running through the jungle – Rambo
Liberace tango
Swinging on a vine, mango (mango)
So call me Simba little mama
'Cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that choppa just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me Mr. Miyagi and the phantom of the opera
Goin blocka muthafucka
Got that big rocketlauncher

[Sean Garrett - Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Detonatin a bomb, detonatin a fire
Rosé by the bucket
Money make an attire
Detonatin a bomb, detonatin them hits
Gonna buy out the bar
Oh my (oh my) bitches is rich
Ya better duck when it comes
better duck cause it's comin
Best believe when you ru-ru-ru-runnin
Now tell that bitch that Nicki said this
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster!

[Sean Garrett]
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla

[Sean Garrett - Chorus]
