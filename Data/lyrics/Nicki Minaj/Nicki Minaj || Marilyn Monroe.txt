
I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure, yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like I’m at the end of the road

I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

It's like all the good things
They fall apart like…
Like Marilyn Monroe

Truth is we mess up
'Til we get it right
I don't want to end up losing my soul

I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me I’m worth it
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)

Call it a curse or just call
Me blessed if you can't handle
My worst you ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
