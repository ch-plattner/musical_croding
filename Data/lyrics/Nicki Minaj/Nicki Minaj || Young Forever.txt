
I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely, pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be OK, come with me
I never knew you would lie to me
Take everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever

I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear, only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever

This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

Don’t say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever

You’ll always be mine, frozen in time
Young forever (young forever)
