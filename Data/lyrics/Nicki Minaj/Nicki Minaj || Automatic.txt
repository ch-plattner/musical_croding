
I can't control the way I'm moving my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

It's automatic I'm a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you best how tonight

It's automatic my condition's unknown
There's no remedy, and no antidotes
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki, so bad tonight, night ah ah ah ah

I can't control the way I'm moving my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic

It's automatic some might call it insane
I assure you I'd be stuck in your brain
You be falling for me boy
Yeah just like a domino tonight, night

It's automatic when I'm rockin the beats
Systematically I'm dropping your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki, so bad tonight, night ah ah ah ah

I can't control the way I'm moving my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic

Press rewind, press rewind
Einstein, I'm looking for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland, Scotland, I get idoled in South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bring the bill, bring the bill, bring the bill
Shut the club down, and bring the bill

I can't control the way I'm moving my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
