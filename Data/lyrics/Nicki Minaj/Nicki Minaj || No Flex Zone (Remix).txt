They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel
I treat it so special
Now your ho jealous
Freak Hoes got several
They tens or better
I'm a trendsetter
I'm a go-getter

Hell no you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a perc' now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches, make a nigga dick soft
Bitch ball like I'm at tip off
Get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and bone jeans I can slip off
Bitch I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for 5 years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me
Do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought You Knew Better
Do your fucking research
You ain't know this the no rip zone
This the "You can't beat Nick" zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt's home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nic's magnitude
Even if they had a longitude latitude
Listen up ho this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury, like an episode of ER
Bitch I'm hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skill, ain't nobody wanna see her
Motherfuckers flexin, motherfuckers acting
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain't pushing out I'm a give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you're ugly it's a no text zone, it's a no sex zone, it's a no flex zone
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you're ugly it's a no text zone, it's a no sex zone, it's a no flex zone

No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel
I treat it so special
Now your ho jealous
Freak Hoes got several
They tens or better
I'm a trendsetter
I'm a go-getter
