[Verse 1:]
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auction
Cause we pack show Cel-tics like Boston
You see me in the lobby taking pics I'm flossin
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches but approach with caution
You be talking slick and honestly I can see why
You don't know me and I ain't talking bout TI
Just when they thought I was done for the winter I
Came out stunting I'm such a big spender I
Two of everything but no I'm not a Gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game, cause you know I only fuck with ballers (yep!)
Them is my type of niggas, shot-callers
I been around the world I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow I'm groovy bitches
And no you're no match for my oozie bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like wetter than jacuzzi bitches

[Chorus:]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that can steal my shine.
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch.

I'm the baddest bitch
The mistress I'm the baddest bitch.
I'm the baddest bitch
Trick-trick-trick please I'm the baddest bitch.

[Verse 2:]
[laughing]
Half a bar just to laugh at em
High school if he ball throw my math at em
And if he want some pussy that's a no-no
I only fuck with bad bitches no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj I'm the talk of the town now.

[Chorus]

Baddest, the baddest, my pussy's the phattest I'm bad.
Bad.
Bad, bad.
