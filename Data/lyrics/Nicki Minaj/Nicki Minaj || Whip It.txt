It's real nice, and slippery inside
Rise, guy, come get this pie
Ri ri ri ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it, I pick it up slow, I want it, I kick in the door
Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch

Squeeze my body, rock my body,
Boy, you make me go
Na na na na na me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
Na na na na na me go

We gon'...

Hey stranger over there
I'm really liking that way
You whip it whip it
Yeah, I want you everyday
You're so right, you're so tight
You got my world spinning
You got my world spinning
My head goes round and around, round and around
Now I'm thinking
If we could be, stranger what you say?
I'm really liking that way
You whip it whip it whip it whip it

Na na na na na we go

Na na na na na we go

Squeeze my body, rock my body,

Na na na na na me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
Na na na na na me go

We gon'...
