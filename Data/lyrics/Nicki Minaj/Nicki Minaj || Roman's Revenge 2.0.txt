[Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzing
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen, haha, plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencing
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Lil Wayne]
I eat your face off
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake off
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball
I beat your brakes off
H-H-Hi, I'm Tune', salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch, pardon the goons
Throw dirt on the floor and get caught in the broom
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got money and the power
A woman in the shower
And she don't want nothin' but my johnson, Howard
Sour D's and a swisher sweet, sweet and sour
You scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Huh, I don't know what y'all on
Please, I go in like goin'
Drink drink in my hand with the world in the other
The uzi go "brrrrrrr", stutter
Ha, life is a puzzle, jigsaw
All I do is win, my name should be "Victor"
Old-ass rappers, I'm still the shit, old-ass Pampers
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin'
I'm just pluckin' my ashes, I'ma puff it and pass it
I'm a fuckin' assassin, you should jump in a casket

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Nicki Minaj]
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"N-N-N-Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!)
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Manning, Eli
These bitches calling me (Manning, Eli)
