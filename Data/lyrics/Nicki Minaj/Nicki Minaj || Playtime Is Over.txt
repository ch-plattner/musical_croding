[Nicki Minaj:]
This the one they was waitin on baby
I had to do it

Just when they thought it was safe to play I
Hit'em with the N.I.C the K.I
I'm tinkerbell he's peter pay-a
To these rap bitches I'm mother may-a
I wanna kno why you waste your yime
On these rap hoes that don't write they rhymes
Get a can of a sprite with a twist of lime
Money money money always on my mind
Coupe color purple no I'm not celie
We run new york like we play relay
My flight took off yours has been delayed
Give it to them early bitches so don't be late
Play time is ova when I spit bars
My mixtape bring
All the boys to the yard
All the boys want Nicki
All the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yea they love me long time
Yes I'm the girl that you heard of
I commit murda
I body bitches I don't need a burna
Queens, oh yes I rep queens
Little white T, plus sum tight jeans
I make it heard for these chicks to breath
Wrist on freeze I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin money like it grow on trees
Stay on my a Q'z I stay on my P'z
After I'm done the you will acknowledge
I'm the president never went to college
I'm a bad bitch I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch holla when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin
Got the illest dude in the game speakin my name
I'm the one, I'm the one you heard me
Same number they stiched on mcGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it will you reimburse me
Let me put on my pumps let me grab my skirt see,
I am such a lil ladys let me do my curtsi
Fuck a dry pussy bitch cause I know she thirsty.
