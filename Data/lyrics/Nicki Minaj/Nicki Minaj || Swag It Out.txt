[Nicki Minaj:]
Dear Tiara why these bitches so mad now,
You know they went and put my flow up in the mad house
Just left the court room, Yeah me and my cold-izlle
We got them sniffles that'll make a nigga nose tickle
Anyway I'm nice, you know my price I'm such a D girl
Fish scale so they think I work at Sea World
Now you the pussy cop cause I make this pussy pop
If you throw some ice up on it you can have this pussy-pop
Aw su-sukie ride him like my suzuki
You know my coochie got him lookin' like pookie

[Lil Kim:]
My money up front, I don't do rain checks
Money over niggas, that's what I call safe sex
It's the Q-U-double E-N-B-double E
Champagne bottles shake, Oh so bubbly
And I'm always tryna come again
Sorta like a nympho but only for the benjamins
Young nigga got a sweet tooth for the kim again
Say he like how it sweet like cinnamon
Taste like candy (mmhmm)
Under my vicky panties
Got his ass sprung he want me to meet his family
Can we just cruise for all the haters
Sip Dom P and get high as a sky scraper

Gone baby swag it out, Gone baby swag it out.
