Tell dem pause like a sentence, mi using the comma
Mek we visit Marc Jacobs and call the weddin planner
For a romantic settin in the middle of di savanna
Cause love is in di air and ah wave like a banner
Now the heart inna mi chest is like a hammer!

Worst when you go backshot
None ah dem nah have that
Some of dem running we a go tell dem gal yooo
We a go tell dem gal yooo
