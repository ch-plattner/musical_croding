
She's so pretty
She know they want her but
She's so sididdy
They can't afford her but
All the boys there when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights beam bright got the best boobs
I call her double R my rough rider
We hit a couple malls then I remind her
Cuz on the road of life she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter than a coke bottle

She super charge cars anything for Minaj
And she could only park in the superstar garage
'Cause she-she-she-she bad if anybody ask
Her bags is boss cuz her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover

Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash

She's so dope
You know she even help me transport the dope
That mama stay around that white like the pope
They get the canine but they can't smell the coke
Now you tell me why is it,
Now you tell me why is it
Don't need the ricker's visit
That is beacause I'm about the colour of the ghecko lizard
She L-Lewinsky hold ya bosses
Come around town 300 horses
Power she devour got them gettin' divorces
I don't stop for officers

And now we hit hydrolics
That's for the left turn
We dive the piece she got more horses than a western
You know she beat weight so she don't eat late
A vegetarian and she sippin' on that V8

They try to gas her they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her liquors poppin'
We call it armarol
We chuck the deuces up

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rove, I-I-I love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rove, I-I-I love my Range Rover

Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
