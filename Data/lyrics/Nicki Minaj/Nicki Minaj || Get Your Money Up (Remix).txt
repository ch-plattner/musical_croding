[Nicki Minaj:]
Uh huh, yo yo I need all the dudes in the club get ya money out

Stop, now let me see your booty drop

[Keri Hilson:]
If you think your impressin' us with your ice and your dub
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
If wanna wow me, get your money up

Get your money up boy, get your money up
I wanna see somethin' bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up boy, get your money up
You gotta throw somethin' bigger than a hundred bucks

Now slide, slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, you can provide them
Might even act a fool while your hittin' it

When you see me in my days blow a whole lot of change
Tell your boy don't get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, there's nothin' to discuss
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up

Get your money up, get your money up
Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
Get your money up, get your money up
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Get em Keysh

[Keyshia Cole:]
If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly woman
And still livin' with your momma, get your money up
Ridin' big whips, can take care of your kids
Why you lookin' at me? Get your money up

When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You actin Hollywood, you know how we roll
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

[Keri Hilson:]
Get your what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth
You need to put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothin' to say but get your money up

Get your money up boy, get your money up
Know you wanna see somethin' better than them autobus
Get your money up boy, get your money up
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks

Get your money up, get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself)
Get your money up
Get your money up, get your money up
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

[Keyshia Cole:]
Okay now slide, slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it

[Keri Hilson:]
Now grind, grind get yourself some big money
And don't forget about me when you're spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay don't be screamin' out hey girl
(Wait, now let me see your booty drop)
