B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in the cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

That's my ice cream man, my rubber band man
Like to rock a bandana, and, and
He need an antenna
The way they watch him
Be cuter than Santana

Ice cream man, make my ice cream quickly
Imma let it sit, I like my ice cream slippery
Hickory, Dickory, call me Mike Vickory
Imma bad bitch, woof woof, I'm so thickory
Can I lick your, can I lick your ice cream cone
Do it like E.T. I make a nigga phone home
I really like vanilla, but my favorite color chocolate
Chocolate, chocolate, gargle it and gargle it

Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in the cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream

That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream

(Look what you're doing to me)
My ice cream man, 'cuz I can make him scream
Like a Summer Jam fan. And, and he tellaban tan
He fuck with young Nicki, since I came from Band Camp
Ice cream man, make my ice cream quick
They nominate Nick, I like Mahagondal thick
Just put a lot of nuts, Imma lick it off the tip
I fuck with real thugs, I'm not a Chippendale chixx
Now if you see my man, that's my ice cream man
Cuz I never grow up, I'm just like Peter Pan
Baskin Robins, turkey hill buyers
That other bitch bologna
So I call her Oscar Meyer

Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
