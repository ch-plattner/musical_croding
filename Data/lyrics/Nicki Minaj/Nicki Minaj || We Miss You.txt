
Why'd you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene summer night
I wish that you would have waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember

I guess I had to pay you back to your lender
I guess I had to send you back to The Sender
But then again maybe you're gone till November
And maybe this is just a part of the agenda

Why'd you have to go so soon
We miss you

Why couldn't you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should've put my pradas on to come and find you
I could've told you that them niggs was behind you

I could've told you all about my intuition
I could've even brought the extra ammunition

But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you
Should've known from day one I couldn't trust you

Why'd you have to go so soon
We miss you

Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding
If you in a better place then you free
Well then why cant they make me believe it

You said that you would leave these streets
And I know you didn't mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bullet proof
And I'm mad cause you the best that I ever had

Why'd you have to go so soon
We miss you

I'll never love again.
