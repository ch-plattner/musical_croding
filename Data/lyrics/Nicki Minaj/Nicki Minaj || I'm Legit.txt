[Hook 2x — Ciara:]
I-I-I'm the shit
With no makeup
Don't have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine
I'm a dolla worth a dime
Real bosses stand up
Ladies throw your hands up
And say I know I'm cute
I know I'm fly
You ask me why
Cause I'm the shit

[Verse 1 — Nicki Minaj:]
Beat 'em like they stole something
Beat 'em like they stole something
All this booty here got them dreaming
Let me hold something
Lemme lemme hear that boy
Lemme lemme rear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car
And let me steer that boy
Real big pretty titty
Shut down any city
If you want the kit kitty
Gotta get the key for me
All new everything
Plus pay the rent fo' me
If we in the wilderness
Bitches pitch a tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get my body
Long hair no make up doing pilates
Those niggas don't stand on my damn zanotti's
All them bitches is my sons but who's the daddy?
I-I graduate with honors
I ball Nate O' Conner
I did a freestyle then I got a shoutout from Obama
Yes, Yes I am ill
I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons birth control I am on the pill
What I gotta do what I gotta do to 'em
Step up in the club everybody like who 'dem
Girls, girls, me and my girls
Watcha done did I need some referrals
Motherfuckers know I'm the shit legit
And if a motherfucker don't he can suck my dick
I tell 'em everybody else is my opposite
I put 'em on the gang give 'em 5 percent

[Hook 2x — Ciara:]
I-I-I'm the shit
With no makeup
Don't have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine
I'm a dolla worth a dime
Real bosses stand up
Ladies throw your hands up
And say I know I'm cute
I know I'm fly
You ask me why
Cause I'm the shit

[Verse 2 — Nicki Minaj:]
I'm like really famous
I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos
All this famous heinous
Lemme lemme hear that boy
Lemme lemme rear that boy
All this money coming in
But I never share that boy
No lipstick no lashes out
But I got a real big ol' ratchet though
I said dude yo dude you packing out
He said he want good box like Pacquiao
I said well my name Nicki and it's nice to meet ya
If ya really wanna know I give ya my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we looking for some ballers alopecia
I hate wack niggas
I should really slap niggas
These niggas tripping when I put them on the map niggas
How you gonna break that
How you gonna fake that
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls caked high
Sleeping on me no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down no matches though
No they can't keep up they molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch with the cash's flow
L-L-Looking at me like it's my fault
T-T-Trying take sneak pictures with their iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that's what young Harriet died for

[Hook 2x — Ciara:]
I-I-I'm the shit
With no makeup
Don't have to curl my hair up

I know I'm fly
You ask me why
