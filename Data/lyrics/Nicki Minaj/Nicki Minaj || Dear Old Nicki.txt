[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I try to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waiting tell me you ain't 6 feet under
And tell me that you're coming back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?

So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I can't see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I should've kept you with me getting at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your powers
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in you

They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I can't see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
To that

And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
To that
