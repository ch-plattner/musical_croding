Excuse me little mama but you can say I'm on duty
I'm looking for a cutie
A real big ole ghetto booty
I really like your kitty kat and if you let me touch her
I'll know your not a bluffer, I'll take you to go see Usher
I keep a couple hoes like Santa I keep a Vixen
Got that Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees (wooh)
Alotta bread, (wooh) no sesame seeds
If I'm in yo city I'm signing them tig old bitties
I'm plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy
The girls wanna minaj, yeah they wetter than the rainin
Usher buzz me in, everybody loves raymond
