[Chorus:]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected my life reflected

Daddy was a crack fiend 2 in the morning had us running down the block like a track team

[Verse 1:]
When he burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my queen and I ain't even British
She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent
She saw something in me that, 'til this day I don't know if I could be that
But I'm a die trying and when I'm done crying
Grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
and should've thrown a book at you 'cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

[Chorus: x2]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected

[Verse 2:]
Damn I wanna run to you
Hold you and kiss you tell you how I miss you
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's officially over and I can't let you go
But I gotta let you know all the shit I did make it feel like I'm dying real slow,
'cause no one understands me they don't know what to do when I'm hurt when I'm angry
You was my friend and my man and my daddy,
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me anything I ever needed knew you had me
'Cause of you all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you that's the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
I finally understand the true meaning of karma

[Chorus: x2]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected

Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to busy tryna have fun
and now I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'cause god knows I was better than that to conceive then leave you the concept alone seems evil I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhere to the nonsense listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the fuck would they know what I was ready to do
And of course it wasn't your fault
It's like I feel it in the air, I hear you saying mommy don't cry
can't you see I'm right here I gotta let you know what you mean to me
when I'm sleeping I see you in my dreams with me wish I could touch your little face
or just hold your little hand if it's part of gods plan, maybe we can meet again

[Chorus: x2]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected
