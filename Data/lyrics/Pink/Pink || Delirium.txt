
So she thinks she's got a new boyfriend
But the two of them have never met
She's already got his name tattoo'd
In a heart across her chest

Well his picture's plastered on her wall
But he has never called
And even all her friends
They say you're livin a delirium

Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada -- um

Secretly she's stalking him on the street
Making sure she's one step behind
They even went to the movies together
Or atleast they stood in the same line

She tells everyone he sends her flowers
And all them letters he sent her, too
And they talk on the phone for hours
Its obvious she's come unglued

Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada -- um

Every night you'll find her all alone
Fantasizing 'bout the brand new home
And she's waiting
For the bells to ring-a-la-ding-a-ling

Oh, god, she's lost her mind
And her friends tell her all the time
That its make believe -- this guy she sees --
Its her disease, she's living a delirium

She's so happy that she found someone, but she's still living in delirium
She's so happy that she found someone, but she's still living in delirium

Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
(she's so happy that she found someone, but she's still living a delirium)
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
(she's so happy that she found someone, but she's still living a delirium)
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --
Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in deliri --

Badadadadadadadadadada, babe, you live in a delirium
