I do not trust, so I cannot love
(can't no man be trusted)
Oh no no no
And I would not dare to open up
(this life of yours is dusted Pink)
Well my rent's past due and now my car won't start, I hate the bus
(well aren't you glad you have somebody to talk to)
Tell me what do they see when they look at me
Do they see my many personalities

[Chorus:]
Can you help me
Does anybody hear me
Can they even see me
This is my reality, oh oh

(can it be my turn now, is it my turn Pink)
Said I'll say it again, you're my only friend
(I protect you from the world, I basically protect you from yourself)
Though I can't go on, I'm not satisfied with this being the end
(this is just the beginning)
Tell me why can't I just reach up and simply touch the sky
Tell me why can't I spread my arms and fly and fly and fly
Tell me why can't I say this, why can't I do that
Tell me what do they want from me, tell me how to act

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

So I'm putting it all on the table
(tell em' Pink)
You don't know me well enough to label me, sick, or even disturbed
When you break it down I'm just two girls
Trying to blend, trying to vibe
(trying)
Trying to live just one life
(so hard)
Everybody's got insanities...I got a split personality
Tell me why can't I just reach up and simply touch the sky
(why can't you)
Tell me why can't I spread my arms and fly and fly and fly
(you can)
Tell me why can't I say this, why can't I do that
(just do it)
Tell me what do they want from me, tell me how to act
(I can't, I can't) 

[Repeat Chorus 3x]

Can you help me
(talk to me, talk to me, don't ignore me, I can't take it)
Do you hear me
Do you see me everytime
(oh calm down, it's not that serious, we'll be just fine without them)
It's all mine...it's my reality...it's just too much for me
(you're my friend, you're my friend...Pink!...Pink!)
