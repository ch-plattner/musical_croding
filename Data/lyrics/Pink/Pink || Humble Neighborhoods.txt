
We don't wanna go home
We're bad people and we do bad things [2x]

[Verse 1]
Here we go, don't ya know
We're the ones that keep it wicked
Rock n' Roll, all good, mix it up
That's my ticket
Cruisin' in my Cadillac Escalade trickin'
Sometimes like it easy, sometimes
Like it rugged
Keep control, don't ya know
Hit the floor, run for cover
Flew around the world about fifty times over
From New York to LA to the white cliffs of
Dover, the road can be my enemy
The road can be my lover

(watch how we do this here
yeah, watch how we do this here) 

[Chorus]
From the humble neighborhoods 
We're takin' over the dance floor
From the humble neighborhoods
We're gettin' out of control

[Verse 2]
Here we go, hit the road
We're the ones that make it crazy
Mix it up, try luck
This ain't time to get lazy
Meetin' at 11 in the hotel lobby
Same faces, different places
NEver knowin' where we going now
Someday I'm gonna die but it
Won't be from boredom
If you've got the skills then I suggest
That you throw down 
Meet us at the spot 'cause it's
Gonna be a showdown
Naw, you can't ride the bus
Man you better cool down

[Chorus]

[Verses 1]
[Chorus (Out)]
