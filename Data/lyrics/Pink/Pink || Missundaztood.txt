Go Damon 
Go Linda 
Go Pink 
Hahaha yeah 
It's me 

I might be the way everybody likes to say 
I know what you're thinking about me 
There might be a day you might have a certain way

But you don't in my luxuries 
And its me, I know I know my name 
Cuz I say it proud 
Everything I want I always do 
Lookin' for the right track 
Always on the wrong track 
But all you're catchin' are these tracks that I'm
layin' down for you 

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night 
There's a voice I am hearin' sayin' its alright 
When I'm happy, I'm sad, but everything is good 
Its not that complicated I'm just missundaztood 

There might be a day everything, it goes my way 
Can't you think I know I'm superfly? 
I might see the world in a world inside of you 
Then I just might say goodbye 
And its my name I know, I say it loud cuz I'm
really proud 
Of all the things I used to do 
Cuz its the wrong track 
Lookin' for the right track 
And all you're catchin' are these tracks that I'm
layin' down for you 

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night 
There's a voice I am hearin' sayin' its alright 
When I'm happy, I'm sad, but everything is good 
Its not that complicated I'm just missundaztood 

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night 
There's a voice I am hearin' sayin' its alright 
When I'm happy, I'm sad, but everything is good 
Its not that complicated I'm just missundaztood 

Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Lookin' for the right track 
Always on the wrong track 
But all you're catchin' are these tracks that I'm
layin' down for you 

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night 
There's a voice I am hearin' sayin' its alright 
I was taken for granted but its all good 
Cuz I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood 
Said I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood 
I said I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood 
I said I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
UH! Yeah, yeah, UH! UH! UH! UH! Bring it back,
UH!
