This my rap song 

1-2-3-4 
I get really sick and tired of boys up in my face

Pick up lines like "What's your sign" won't get
you anyplace 
When me and all my girls go walking down the
street 
It seems we can't go anywhere without a car that
goes "Beep-beep" 

Cuz this body is a priceless piece of lovin'
unconditionally 
So, Mr. Big-stuff, who you think you are? 
You was thinkin' you's gonna get it for free 
No, no, no, 

Hey ladies 
(Yeah!) 
Let 'em know it ain't easy 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Let's come togeta' 
Sista's 
(Yeah!) 
Its time to be greedy 
Nothin' good comes for free 

Mirror on the wall, damn I sure look fine 
I can't blame those horny boys, I would make me
mine 
When I pass you in a club, "Ooh, lala!" you gasp 
Back up boy, I ain't your toy, or your piece of
ass 

Cuz this body is a priceless piece of lovin'
unconditionally 
So, Mr. Big-stuff, who you think you are? 
You was thinkin' you's gonna get it for free 
No, no, no 

Hey ladies 
(Yeah!) 
Let 'em know it ain't easy 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Let's come togeta' 
Sista's 
(Yeah!) 
Its time to be greedy 
Nothin' good comes for free 

Hey ladies 
(Yeah!) 
Let 'em know it ain't easy 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Let's come togeta' 
Sista's 
(Yeah!) 
Its time to be greedy 
Nothin' good comes for free 

No jealousy, no envy girls, c'mon, let's work it
out 
No freebies in the limousine, that's not what its
about 
Let 'em know there's work to do, give it up he
won't call you 
Respect is just a minimum, go on girl and get you
some 

1-2-3-4 

Hey ladies 
(Yeah!) 
Let 'em know it ain't easy 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Let's come togeta' 
Sista's 
(Yeah!) 
Its time to be greedy 
Nothin' good comes for free 

Hey ladies 
(Yeah!) 
Let 'em know it ain't easy 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Let's come togeta' 
Sista's 
(Yeah!) 
Its time to be greedy 
Nothin' good comes for free  

Let's come together 
C'mon girls let's work it out 
Let's come together 
We'll show them what we're talkin' bout 
Let's come together 
C'mon girls let's work it out 
Let's come together 
Let's come together 
Let's come together 
Nothin' good comes for free
