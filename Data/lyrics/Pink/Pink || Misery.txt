Shadows are fallin' all over town 
Another night and these blues got me down 
Oh, misery! I sure could use some company 
Since he's been gone I ain't been the same 
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain 
Guess its all meant to be 
For love to cause me misery 

Oh misery! Oh misery! 
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me 
Seems its my destiny 
For love to cause me misery 

And, oh! I've been down this road before 
With a passion that turns into pain 
And each I saw love walk out the door 
I swore never get caught again 

But ain't it true? It takes what it takes 
And sometime we get too smart to leave 
One more heartache for me 
Another night of misery 

Oh! And oh misery! Oh misery! 
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me 
Oh misery! Oh misery! 
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this
heart make a fool of me 
Seems its my destiny 
For love to cause misery, oh 
Misery 
Guess its all meant to be 
For love to cause me misery, oh, no, yeah 
Misery
