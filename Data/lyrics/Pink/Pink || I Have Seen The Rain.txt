I have seen the rain
I have felt the pain
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I don't know where I'm going
I don't even know where I've been
But i know I'd like to see them again.

Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder baby
I've stopped wonderin' what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier ho-oh they've said I should've been more
Probably so if i hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war.

I have seen the rain
I've survived the pain
Oh I've been home 30 years or so
And I'm just stepping off of the plane

Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder baby
I've stopped wonderin' what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier ho-oh they've said I should've been more
Probably so if i hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war.

We have seen the rain, together
We have survived the pain, forever
Oh it's good to home again
Its good to be with my friends
Oh it's good to be home again
It's good to feel that rain
