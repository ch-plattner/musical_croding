
Screw fear, it's contagious
Infecting everything
It makes me do such stupid, stupid stuff
I say things I never mean
What exactly do I think?
Who am I protecting?
If I fall it'll blow up in my face
That's just crazy

I'm delicate, I'm sensitive
Please try to be more careful
You're mean, you're a lunatic
Let's try to make this fun again

It's only love, give it away
(It's only love)
You'll probably get it back again
(It's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love, not a time bomb

I'm tired from last nights fight
I wish I hadn't started it
I hate when my fear speaks for me
It makes me nasty
I thought we could start again
Go back to the days when we felt like friends
It's all too serious for me
And I know I'm guilty

Matchsticks and poison
That's what I add to the fire
My dear, I'm frozen
Turned from a saint to a liar

It's only love, give it away
(It's only love)
You'll probably get it back again
(It's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love not a time bomb

I don't want to be precious
I don't want to feel stress
Life is for the living, 
But not a living hell
So take it
Take this
Oh, you can have all of me
Take it
Take this
Here, you can have everything
I don't want to be flawless
When I go I want the cuts to show
So take it
Take this
Oh, you can have all of me
Break it
Take it
Oh, fuck it, have everything

It's only love, give it away
(It's only love)
You'll probably get it back again
(It's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love not a time bomb
(It's only love)
(It's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love not a time bomb
