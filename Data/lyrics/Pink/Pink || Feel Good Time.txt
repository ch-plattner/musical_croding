
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.....
[laughs]
we go where we like,
we got over time,
we get paid to rattle our chains

we go in the back, 
paint our money black,
spend it on the enemy

sleeping in the church,
riding in the dirt, 
put a banner over my grave

Make a body work,
make a begger hurt,
sell me something big and untamed

[Chorus]

Now our time, real good time,
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)

now our time, a real good time
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)

now our time, (SAID NOW OUR TIME),
a real good time (ITS A REALLY GOOD TIME!)

B-a-a-a-a-by of mine

we know how to pray, 
party everyday,
make our desolation look plain
(not 2 sure if unsafe is the rite word)

riding in a rut, 
till the powers cut, 
we dont even have a good name

sleeping in the church,
riding in the dirt, 
put a banner over my grave

Make a body work,
make a begger hurt,
sell me something big and untamed

[Chorus]

...Now our time, real good time, oohh
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)
now our time, a real good time
(doo doo........)
now our time, (NOW IT OUR TIME), a real good time 

B-a-a-a-a-by of mine

doo doo doo doo....baby....i can fly...yeh
(sell me sumthin big and untamed) 

now are time, real good time ......oh, 
(doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
now our time (I SAID NOW OUR TIME),
(doo doo doo doo doo doo)
real good time (ITS A REALLY GOOD TIME)
now are time, real good time .....

Feel good, 
Real good, its the same old saying

Real good,
Feel good, dont got no more brains

Feel good, 
Real good, its the same old saying....yeh 
Feel good,
Real good, i dont got no more brain!
