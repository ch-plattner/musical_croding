The King is dead but the Queen is alive, 
Off with his head I am done with his lies, 
A fair win I have fought for my life,
A clean slate after all this time,

A revolution and now I am in charge, 
My evolution is to shoot for the stars,
His first mistake: he underestimates, 
He didn't bother to appreciate

So, rah rah rah!
Sis boom fuckin' bah! 
There's a party in your honor, 
But you won't be there whatever, so, 
Three cheers for the one that got away! 
You were just blah blah blah, 
I was oh my god, 
And unlike your anatomy, 
I'm glad I had it in me, 
Now The King, 
The King, the King, 
The King is dead! 
But The Queen is alive 

I guess the village didn't raise you right, 
Don't think nobody's gonna mourn you tonight, 
No more licks to wet your appetite, 
You make me sick, I didn't wanna fight

I thought we ruled the heavens and the earth, 
I really thought I was the only girl, 
Your secrets have all been revealed to me, 
You've been dethroned there goes your legacy! 

So, rah rah rah!
Sis boom fuckin' bah! 
There's a party in your honor, 
But you won't be there whatever, so, 
Three cheers for the one that got away! 
You were just blah blah blah, 
I was oh my god, 
And unlike your anatomy, 
I'm glad I had it in me, 
Now The King, 
The King, the King, 
The King is dead! 
But The Queen is alive 

There are consequences in this life, 
A punishment that fit the crime, 
Your last words, I heard I'm sorry, 
Now look at me in all my glory! 

The King is dead but the Queen is alive, 
I wear your crown and I look quite nice, 
I almost let you get the best of me 
But no one's ever gonna get the Queen! 

So, rah rah rah!
Sis boom fuckin' bah! 
There's a party in your honor, 
But you won't be there whatever, so, 
Three cheers for the one that got away! 
You were just blah blah blah, 
I was oh my god, 
And unlike your anatomy, 
I'm glad I had it in me, 
Now The King, 
The King, the King, 
The King is dead! 

But The Queen is alive!
