
Please don't come around talkin bout that you love me
Cuz that love shit just ain't for me
And I dont wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doin is runnin your mind games
Don't you know my game beats these games
So your best bet is to be straight with me

So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk, I'll walk, yeah it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, what you think about that
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically, I'm through with you
Whatcha wanna say, had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're beggin me to stay

[Chorus:]
There you go, lookin pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talkin bout you miss me so, that you love me so, why I let ya go
There you go cause your lies got old, look at you
There you go

Please don't come around talkin bout how you changed
How you said good-bye to what's-her-name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from round you, cuz my life was all about you

So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah, it's like that
Had your chance, won't take ya back
Now what, whatcha think about that
And when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through wit you
Whatcha wanna say
Had to have it your way, had to play games, now you're beggin me to stay

[Repeat Chorus]

Oooh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time
Don't you wish you still were mine
Don't you wish I'd take you back
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh
Didn't miss a good thing till it was gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long, till you came runnin back
Missin my love, there you go

[Repeat Chorus 3x]

So there you go, there you go
