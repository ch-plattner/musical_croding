No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend 
I was too deep, I can't let you go and just jump
in 
At times I would push my feelings aside to let
you feel 
I'm novicane I'm numb and nothing's real 

Like the coldest winter, I am frozen from you 

I was weak before now you made me so numb 
I can't feel much for you anymore 
I gave you my all, my baby 
I'm numb, numb, numb 

But the tears were silent inside you see 
But the tears were silent inside you see 

I laid there quiet, watched you have your way
with me 
I might have cried, the tears were silent inside
you see 
You called me names, made me feel like I was dumb

I didn't feel a thing and now I'm gone, gone,
gone 

Like a battered child I got used to your pain 
But you know its cuz 

I was weak before now you made me so numb 
I can't feel much for you anymore 
I gave you my all, my baby 
I'm numb, numb, numb

I was weak before now you made me so numb 
I can't feel much for you anymore 
I gave you my all, my baby 
I'm numb, numb, numb 

Don't feel a thing, don't feel the pain 
Numb, numb, numb 
Said 

I was weak before now you made me so numb 
I can't feel much for you anymore 
I gave you my all, my baby 
I'm numb, numb, numb 

I was weak for 
Said now I'm numb, numb, numb 
No, no, no, no
