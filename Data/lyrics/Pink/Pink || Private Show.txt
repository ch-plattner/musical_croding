
Silly you, silly me
To letcha in and put a move on me
Yeah yeah yeah
Never once asked for love
Always took it for what it's worth, memories

[Bridge:]
See I dont wanna meet on a lonely street
Where the talk is cheap and the price is sweet
I'm not that girl, Im not that girl
And you dont wanna see the other side of me
So I'm gonna hit ya off and I'm gonna set ya free
Before you fall too deep, don't fall too deep

[Chorus:]
He don't know
I'm gonna be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay, I'll let him go
Cuz all he wants from me is a private show
Ohhh...

He's all talk, think's he knows, how this game's supposed to go
For everyone
Still it seems, he can't see
Thinks he's just usin' me, usin' me

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

He don't know
Maybe if he wasn't such a gigalo, (a nasty hoe)
I would let him stay, instead I let him go
Cuz all he wants from me is a private show 
Ohhh...

He dont know
I'm gonna be the one who's gonna let him go, I let him go
Private show, oh no no no no
He don't know, I let him go, nasty hoe
Ohhh, pri-vate show, he don't know, he don't know
Let him go...even if he wants to stay I'll let him go
Cuz all he wants from me is a private show...oh oh oh
He don't know...oh oh oh...he don't know
