I can remember the very first time I cried 
How I wiped my eyes and buried the pain inside 
All of my memories - good and bad - that's past 
Didn't even take the time to realize 

Starin' at the cracks in the walls 
Cuz I'm waiting for it all to come to an end 
Still I curl up right under the bed 
Cuz its takin' over my head all over again 

Do you even know who you are? 
I guess I'm tryin' to find 
A borrowed dream or a superstar? 
I want to be a star 
Is life good to you or is it bad? 
I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have? 

Lyin' awake watchin' the sunlight 
How the birds will sing as I count the rings
around my eyes 
Constantly pushing the world I know aside 
I don't even feel the pain, I don't even want to
try 

I'm lookin' for a way to become 
The person that I dreamt of when I was sixteen 
Oh, nothin' is ever enough 
Ooh, baby, it ain't enough for what it may seem 

Do you even know who you are? 
I'm still tryin' to find 
A borrowed dream or a superstar? 
Everybody wants to be 
Is life good to you or is it bad? 
I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have? 
No 

Sorry girl, tell a tale for me 
Cuz I'm wondering how you really feel 
I'm a lonely girl, I'll tell a tale for you 
Cuz I'm just tryin' to make all my dreams come
true 

Do you even know who you are? 
Oh, yeah, yeah 
A borrowed dream or a superstar? 
Oh, I wanted to be a star 
Is life good to you or is it bad? 
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have? 
I guess not, oh I guess not 

Do you even know who you are? 
Oh, I'm tryin' to find 
A rising dream or a superstar? 
Oh, I have a all these dreams 
Is life good to you or is it bad? 
I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have? 
No, no 
Do you even know what you are? 
A rising dream or a fallen star? 
Is life good to you or is it bad?
