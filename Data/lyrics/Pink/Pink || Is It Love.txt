[Chorus:]
Is it love, or just a curse
Do you feel good when I hurt
I need your heart to open up
If this love's not real, then it's just my luck

Mommy help me, I need your help
This little boy, he took my love
And he says these things that make my body pump up
But then he runs leavin me un-done
And I don't understand
For sex he said he'd be my man

[Repeat Chorus]

Daddy listen, I gave it up
I'm not your little girl
My cherry, and all the trust is missing
But please listen, what do I do
I know you wanna hurt him
But I like what he do, he's only doin what you used to

[Repeat Chorus]

You never told me bout the birds and the bees
Or bout hide n' go seek or what he gets when he finds me
The biggest mistakes in the choices I make
Won't you help me decide, what's goin down in my mind

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

That thing you're puttin on me
Has got me so confused
Won't somebody help me, tell me what should I do
In my heart it feels so good, is it just a curse
Will it get better, or will it get worse

[Repeat Chorus To Fade]
