[Chorus:]
Can't take me home to mama cuz she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you f***** with me
Don't say you're fallin for me, don't tell me you adore me
Cuz all you're thinkin bout is f***** me
Can't take me home to mama cuz she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you f***** with me
Don't say you're fallin for me, don't tell me you adore me
Cuz all you're thinkin bout is f***** me

Why'd ya even talk to me, baby were you curious
You knew you never had a love like this
My love was serious, had you delirious
Don't front, I felt it in every kiss
You try and play me, like I ain't your lady
When you just told me that you love me and you want me as your baby
Understand me, cuz I know we can be
Just as happy as anybody, let your heart feel me baby

[Repeat Chorus]

What the hell was on your mind
You thought I had the time, to be your little undercover thing
But see I can't deal with that, so you better just split with that
Come at me real
Quit playin these silly games
How can you love me, and then just leave me
Because you see somebody looking
And you think they disagree
Well they don't feed you, so why you care boo
Cuz the best love you ever had is right here with you

[Repeat Chorus]

I don't want nobody else but you
But if you keep playing, then I'll make you the fool
Cuz it's a Pink thang
It's the way you would wanna get with me
Oh, it's a Pink thang
Tell you, your mama you're just gonna hafta see

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
