Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Pink Airlines
We hope your flight is enjoyable and our flight attendants are here to insure your ride is as pleasant as possible
Seat backs and tray tables must be in the upright and locked position during the take-off and landing
All carry-on luggage must be stowed in an over-head compartment or under the seat in front of you

Waiting on a ticket
'Cause you're looking for the ride
You're feeling on top
'Cause you're flying through the sky
You wanna have your cake
And you wanna eat it too
Everybody's always pointing fingers at you
You're damned if you do
You're damned if you don't
We're always doing all the things
That we say we won't

[CHORUS:]
Here we go
We're riding on a whim
Connecting with a rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles
It's a catch-22
Yes, we're flying round in circles
It's a catch-22
yes, were rocking round in circles 
It's the catch-22

[SPOKEN:]
If you are seated in an emergency exit aisle and feel as though you are unable
Or unwilling to assist in case of an emergency, please notify a flight attendant immediately
All eletrical equipment, including cell phones, 2-way pagers, portable CD players, laptops, etc.
Should remain in the off position until the pilot notifies us that we areat a safe flying altitude of 10,000 ft.

Looking from the outside
You're always looking in
You think you fixed the problem
'Til it comes right back again
And life seems like a trap
You're trying to get out
You're searching for you cheese
'Cause you feel like mighty mouse
You're damned if you don't
You're damned if you do
You've seen all the signs
But you haven't got a clue

[CHORUS]

You are in, you are in
You are in, you are in
You are in for the ride
Of your life

[CHORUS]

[SPOKEN:]
We realize you had many choices and on behalf of all of us at Pink Airlines we'd like to thank you for flying with us
We hope you have a wonderful stay wherever your destination may be
And remember, be careful when retrieving your items as during the flight they may have shifted and might fall on you
Or your neighbor's head and knock you the fuck out

[CHORUS]
