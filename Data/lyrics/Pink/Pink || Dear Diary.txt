Cuz you're the only one that I know who'll keep
them 
Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
I know you'll keep them, and this is what I've
done 

I've been a bad, bad girl for so long 
I don't know how to change what went wrong 
Daddy's little girl when he went away 
What did it teach me? That love leaves 

Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
Cuz you're the only one that I know who'll keep
them 
Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
I know you'll keep them, and this is what I've
done  

I've been down every road you could go 
I made some bad choices as you know 
Seems I have the whole world cradled in my hands 
But its just like me not to understand  

Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
Cuz you're the only one that I know who'll keep
them 
Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
I've been a bad, bad girl 

I learned my lessons 
I turned myself around 
I've got a guardian angel tattooed on my shoulder

She's been watching over me 

Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
Cuz you're the only one that I know who'll keep
them 
Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
I've been a bad, bad girl 

Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
Cuz you're the only one that I know who'll keep
them 
Dear, dear diary, I want to tell my secrets 
I've been a bad, bad girl 

I've been a bad, bad girl
