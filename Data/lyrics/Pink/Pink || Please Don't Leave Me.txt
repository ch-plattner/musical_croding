Da da da da da,

I don't know if I can yell any louder,
How many times have I kicked you out of here
Or said something insulting?

Da da da da da

I can be so mean when I wanna be,
I am capable of really anything,
I can cut you into pieces,
When my heart is broken.

Da da da da da

Please, don't leave me [2x]
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty.
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest.
But baby I don't mean it,
I mean it, I promise

Da da da da da

Please, don't leave me, oh
Please, don't leave me (don't leave me)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

I forgot to say out loud
How beautiful you really are to me.
I can't be without.
You're my perfect little punching bag,
And I need you.
I'm sorry.

Da da da da
Da da da da

Da da da da da

Please, please, don't leave me
Baby, please, don't leave me (no, don't leave me)
Please, don't leave me
(I always say) I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this

Please, don't leave me (yeah)
Please, don't leave me
(I) I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this.
(please, please) please, don't leave me,

Baby, please, please, don't leave me.
