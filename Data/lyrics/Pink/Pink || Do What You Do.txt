Some people like the summer when it's hot
Some people like the winter cold
Some people speak they minds when they wanna
And some other people ain't so bold
Whatever it is that you do you should do
You should do it wit ya head held high
So when you're doin your thing it's cuz you wanna
And they never can ask you why

[Chorus:]
I say do what you do
Say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Cuz it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you gotta do it your way
I say do what you do
Say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Cuz it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you gotta do it your way

Some, they like it easy
When others, they like it rough
But ain't nobody gotta like it but you
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy
Whatever, you should do what you do
How could they tell you that you coulda-shoulda-woulda
When ask them can they walk in your shoes
Cuz it's your life and you do what you wanna
And remember baby, it's all about you

[Repeat Chorus]

So if it's on your mind, then you should speak your piece
And say what you say
And if you want it done, then you should get it done
And do it your way
So if it's on your mind, then you should speak your piece
And say what you say
And if you want it done, then you should get it done
And do it your way

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus Again [after the long break]]
