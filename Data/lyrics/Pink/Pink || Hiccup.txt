[Chorus:]
Why everytime I try to tell you how it feel
It's like a hiccup-cup come and it won't come-come
Soon as I think I'm bout to share my lovin
That's when the hiccup's comin
Why everytime I try to tell you how it feel
It's like a hiccup-cup come and it won't come-come
Soon as I think I'm bout to share my lovin
That's when the hiccup's comin

You're like a cough on a rainy day
You know the kind that gives you chest pains, yeah
And just as things start to feel OK
Then here you come to break away
You love me hard and you squeeze me tight
You let me go then you pick a fight
You make me wanna scream, cry, and shout out-loud
Boy, you got me spinnin round-and-round

[Repeat Chorus]

My thoughts, they kinda shake-y
Everytime I get around you sweet baby
Sometimes, I don't know what I'm tryin to say
Just tell me baby, tell me things are gonna be OK

[Repeat Chorus]

I get all choked up inside
And I don't know what to say
Sometimes I wanna just run and hide
But you just stand in my way

[Repeat Chorus]

Why everytime I tell you how I feel
It's like a hiccup-cup come and you know the deal
Pink don't think before she speak
But you got me feelin, feelin, feelin kinda weak
Why everytime I tell you how I feel
It's like a hiccup-cup come and you know the deal
Pink don't think before she speak
But you got me feelin, feelin, feelin kinda weak

[Repeat Chorus]
