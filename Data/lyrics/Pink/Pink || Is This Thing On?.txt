Got your voicemail
Can you call me, at a hotel
There's something that's weighin' heavy on my heart
And heavy on my chest
I'm the lone night, you're the morning
I annoy you, and you bore me
And it's hard enough to make it through a world that's already a mess
All in good time, we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy

[Chorus]
Tell me, is this thing on?
How do we keep this new
How do I keep you into me, into me 
Without faking it too
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose
Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing, the hardest thing to do

And I want you, to want me
Like the first time you saw me
I know we're ten years on
But in my head we're still young and dumb
It is so hard, to let go and replace you
I still love you
I just wanna find the thing that made me think 
This was the one
All in good time, we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy

[Chorus]
Tell me, is this thing on?
How do we keep this new
How do I keep you into me, into me 
Without thinking it too
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose
Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing, the hardest thing to do

It's the hardest thing, the hardest thing to do

Tell me, is this thing on?
How do we keep this new
How do I keep you into me, into me 
Without faking it too
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose
Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing, the hardest thing to do [x2]
