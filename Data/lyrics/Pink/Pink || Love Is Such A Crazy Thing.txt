
I never thought I'd find someone
But you came along and made me see
That you were the only one for me
Boy, I love you constantly

[Bridge:]
You are my love, my only love
Baby my heart belongs to you
Be with me, don't play with me
If you want love just let me know

[Chorus:]
Love...love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is this love for real
Oh love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is this love for real (love for real)

I dreamed of someone like you before
But I never thought I'd get the chance
To romance someone as sweet as you
I hope you feel the same as I do

[Repeat Bridge]

Love, love is such a crazy thing (crazy feeling)
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is this love for real (boy you are my love)
Love, love is such a crazy thing (love is such a crazy thing)
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is this love for real (oh my love)

[Repeat Bridge]

Love, love is such a crazy thing (it's too crazy for me)
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is the love, is it real, is it real
Love, love is such a crazy thing (love is such a crazy thing)
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel
Is this love for real, love for real
(baby I think of you, I wanna be with you, I don't understand, is this love for real? 
You see I dream of you...every night and day. 
I don't understand, is this love for real? 
Love's such a crazy thing...)
