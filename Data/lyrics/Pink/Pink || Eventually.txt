I am an opportunity and I knock so softly 
Sometimes I get loud when I wish everybody'd just
get off me 
So many playas you'd think I was a ball game 
Its every man for themself, there are no
team mates 
This life gets lonely when everybody wants
something 
This might have been your fate 
But they'll get their's eventually 
And I hope I'm there 

Surrounded by familiar faces without names 
None of them know me or want to share my pain 
And they only wish to bask in my light, then fade
away 
To win my love, to them a game 
To watch me live my life in pain 
When all is done and the glitter fades, fades
away 
They'll get their's eventually 
And I hope I'm there 

I drank your poison cuz you told me its wine 
Shame on you if you fool once 
Shame on me if you fool me twice 
I didn't know the price 
You'll get yours eventually 

So what good am I to you if I can't be broken? 
You'll get yours, yes you'll get yours 
Eventually
