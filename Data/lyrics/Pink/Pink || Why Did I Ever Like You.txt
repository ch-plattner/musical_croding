There was a 5.8 earthquake today 
and it kinda got me thinking
I'd still have all my hate for you in tact 
even if I lost everything

What did I say
Why are you shaking your head 
You know you done me wrong
I may be crazy it's all in my head
But I want you darling gone

Why did I ever like you
What did I see
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion 
A Magic trick on me

eh eh eh eh [repeats for a bit]

It's hard to believe I ever laughed at anything you said
Cos you're just not funny
Who would believe I'd let you do all those things
Oh I guess the joke was on me

I tried to be zen
I've even asked all my friends
To help me let it slide
But all I see is your face
In my favourite place
And I can't help but wonder why

Why did I ever like you
What did I see
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion 
A Magic trick on me

eh eh eh eh [repeats for a bit]

Yeaaahhheee

I tried to be zen
I've even asked all my friends
To help me let it slide
All I see is your face
In my favourite place
And I can't help but wonder why

Why did I ever like you
What did I see
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion 
A Magic trick on me

eh eh eh eh [repeats for a bit]

Tell me why did I
Why did I ever like you
What did I see
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion 
A Magic trick on me
