
Dear baby, I'm not sorry for leavin you this way
But I know that I should have told you face-to-face
We've always been straight up so I, I won't waste your time
I'm leavin, say good-bye, because I know what you did last night

[Chorus:]
Let me let you know, yeah
That I'm leavin baby
Let me let you know, yeah
That I'm leavin baby
Let me let you know
I don't know where I'm goin but I'm goin far from here
Let me let you know yeah
That I'm leavin baby

One more thing before I go, I hope you feel alone
Cuz I'm definitely tired of waiting for you to come home
(been waitin for you at home)
We've always been straight up, so I, I'll just take what's mine
I'm leavin, say good-bye, because you hurt me for the last time
Let me, let you know

[Repeat Chorus]

Whatever your excuse is, I'm sure, I've heard them all before
Time and time again I told ya, that I need you more
Now I'm walkin out the door

[Repeat Chorus]

Ooh baby, I'm just here to let you know honey
Ooh, yeah
Here to let you know
Let me let you know yeah
I'm leavin

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
