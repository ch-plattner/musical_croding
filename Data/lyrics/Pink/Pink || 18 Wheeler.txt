
Can't keep me down 
Can't keep me down, down 
Can't keep me down 
I said you can't keep me down 
You know you can't keep me down 
I said you can't keep me down 

Hey, hey, man! What's your problem? 
I see you tryin' to hurt me bad 
Don't know what you're up against 
Maybe you should reconsider 
Come up with another plan 
Cuz you know I'm not that kinda girl 
That'll lay there and let you come first 

You can push me out the window 
I'll just get back up 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck 
And I won't give a fuck 
You can hang me like a slave 
I'll go underground 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but 
You can't keep me down, down, down, down 

Can't keep me down, down 
Can't keep me down, down, down 
Can't keep me down, down 

Hey, hey, girl! Are you ready for today? 
You got your shield and sword? 
Cuz its time to play the games 
You are beautiful 
Even though your not for sure 
Don't let him pull you by the skirt
You're gonna get your feelings hurt 

You can push me out the window 
I'll just get back up 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck 
And I won't give a fuck 
You can hang me like a slave 
I'll go underground 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but 
You can't keep me down, down, down, down 

You can push me out the window 
I'll just get back up 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck 
And I won't give a fuck 
You can hang me like a slave 
I'll go underground 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but 
You can't keep me down, down, down, down  

Everywhere that I go 
There's someone waitin' to chain me 
Everything that I say 
There's someone tryin' to short-change me 
I am only this way 
Because of what you have made me 
And I'm not gonna break! 

You can push me out the window 
I'll just get back up 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck 
And I won't give a fuck 
You can hang me like a slave 
I'll go underground 
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but 
You can't keep me down, down, down, down
