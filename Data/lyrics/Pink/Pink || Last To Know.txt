[Chorus]
Why was I the last to know 
That you weren't coming to my show you coulda 
Called me up to say "good luck"
You coulda called me back you stupid fuck
Why was I the last to know?

[Verse 1]
First date, we ate sushi and
It went well, I was funny and
You said I was a cutie
That's the last thing I heard from you
I left the tickets at the door for you
I had to tell my mom that there was 
No more room
You didn't show, that was so uncool
You coulda called me back

So i guess this means that we're 
Not friends anymore, I heard
It's me you're asking for, I thought
I'd see you at the show
You said you'd go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
After the date, I wouldn't go
Home with you
I wouldn't put my heels in the
Air for you
You tried to get me to do things
I just won't do
Last I heard from you
Here is how I guess the story goes
You woulda came if I was a ho
F*** for parts that's just not how
I roll, move it on down the road

So I guess, we, shouldn't be
Friends anymore, sick of hearin'
That it's me you're askin' for
'Cause I thought I'd see you at the
Show, you said you'd go!

[Chorus]

You thought you know me
I guess you didn't
You thought you had me
I think you didn't 
You thought you knew me
But you didn't

[Chorus (Out)]
