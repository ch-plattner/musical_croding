
I wish I could live my life on an aeroplane
I'd have free drinks all day
And my stewardess would say

If you're under pressure
There's a mask above your head
Make sure yours is secure
Before you try to help your friend

Look out the window and see the sunshine
No more construction, destruction & dying
I could float through the clouds with my cell phone turned off
as high as I can go and I never belong

Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash & burn
I'll never crash & burn

If I lived my life on an aeroplane
I'd pick up all my friends and we'd drift away
Citizens of nowhere with no red & blue divide
We'd leave the world where greed and propaganda multiplies

Everywhere is love
Everyone is love
Everwhere is love

Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash & burn
I'll never crash & burn

No complications
No starring roles
We'd all have plenty
We'll never crash and burn
We'll never crash and burn

Everyone is love
Everywhere is love

Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash & burn
I'll never crash & burn
