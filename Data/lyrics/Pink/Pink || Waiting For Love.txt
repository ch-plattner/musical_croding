[Verse 1]
She looks to the sun 
Help her to carry on
Braking down all the years 
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky 
Counting the reasons why 
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past

[B-Section]
All the changes, and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says

[Verse 2]
She looks to the stars
Breaking, time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

[B-Section]
And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
A she is starting to drown

[Chorus]
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
Waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long

[Verse 3]
She prays to the Gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where I am today
Life is looking very grey

[B-Section]
All the changes, all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm waiting for a new day to rise
COnversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And I want it, and I need it, and I'll leave it all behind

And all the changes I've made
And I remember the words, that you'll never say

[Chorus (3x)]

She looks to the sun
