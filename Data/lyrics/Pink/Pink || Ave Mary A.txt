
Motorcycle's in the parking lot
Revving their engines and it just wont stop
Matches the noise screaming in my head
Houston I think we got a problem

Where does everybody go when they go
The go so fast I don't think they know
We hate so fast
And we love too slow
London I think we got a problem

And when I think about it
I just can't think about it
I try to drink about it
I keep spinning

Ave Mary A
Where did you go
Where did you go
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad
Help me let go
Of the chaos around me
The devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me

Child be still
Child be still

Broken hearts all around the spot
I can't help thinking that we lost the plot
Suicide bomber and a student shot
Tokyo I think we got a problem

But for that they have gotta pill
If that don't kill you then the side effects will
If we don't kill each other then the side effects will
Cape Town I think we got a problem

Ave Mary A
Where did you go
Where did you go
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad
Help me let go
Of the chaos around me
The devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me

Child be still

If the darkest hour comes
Before the light
Where is the light
Where is the light

If the darkest hour comes
Before the light
Where is the light
Where is the light
Where is the light, yeah

Ave Mary A
Where did you go
Where did you go
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad
Help me help me let go
Of the chaos around me
The devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me

Child be still
Child be still
Child be still
