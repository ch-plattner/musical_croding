
Daddy was a soldier he taught me about freedom 
Peace and all the great things that we take
advantage of 
Once I fed the homeless, I'll never forget 
I look upon thier faces as I treated them with
respect 
And 

This is my Vietnam 
I'm at war 
Life keeps on dropping bombs 
And I keep score 

Momma was a lunitic, she liked to push my buttons

She said I wasn't good enough, but I guess I
wasn't trying 
Never like school that much, they tried to teach
me better 
But I just wasn't hearing it because I thought I
was already pretty clever 
And 

This is my Vietnam 
I'm at war 
They keeps on dropping bombs 
And I keep score 

This is my Vietnam 
I'm at war 
They keep on dropping bombs 
And I keep score 

What do you expect from me? 
What am I not giving you? 
What could I do for you to make me OK in your
eyes? 

This is my Vietnam 
I'm at war 
They keep on dropping bombs 
And I keep score 

This is my Vietnam 
I'm at war 
Life keeps on dropping bombs 
And I keep score 

This is my Vietnam 
This is my Vietnam
