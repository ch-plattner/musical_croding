
(Ahh, Ah,Ha,Ha,Ha,Ha)
(Yeah, Mhmm)
(Mmm, Uhh)

I’m alone now
Staring at the ceiling
(Uh, Uh)
I’m kina bored now
I can’t sleep
(I Can’t Sleep, Uh, Uh)

And you only can make my life complete
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)
and when come you slip into a dream
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When it’s late at night and you’re fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

(Sth, Mmm)

I’m starving (Sth)
For some attention
I’m begging, pleading, bleeding
For a suggestion
(Uh, Uh, Uh)

I bite my tongue because I wanna scream
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)
I’m almost there then you turn and look at me
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When it’s late at night and you’re fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(I let my fingers do the walking)

Rewind and you will see
(You will see)
while in the morning I’m happy
(I’m happy)
Right there on the TV screen
(On the TV)
(¡ME VENGO, ME VENGO!) [Spanish. English: "I'm comming, I'm comming" ]

(Ahh, uh, Uh, Uh, uh)
I’m restless
You need some caffeine
(Ah, Ha, Ha, Ha)
I'm wasted
If you could only see
(only see)

'cause I need more than you are gonna give
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When it’s late at night and you’re fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
(AHHHHHH)!
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(No, No, No No)

When it’s late at night and you’re fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
(My fingers do the walking)
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(No one else is watching)
(I let my fingers do the walking)

(Ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah Uh, Uh, uh Huh
