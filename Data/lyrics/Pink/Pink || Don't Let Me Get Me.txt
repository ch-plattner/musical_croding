
Never win first place, I don't support the team 
I can't take direction, and my socks are never
clean 
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me 
I was always in a fight cuz I can't do nothin'
right 

Everyday I fight a war against the mirror 
I can't take the person starin' back at me 
I'm a hazard to myself 

Don't let me get me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Its bad when you annoy yourself 
So irritating 
Don't wanna be my friend no more 
I wanna be somebody else 

I wanna be somebody else, yeah 

LA told me, "You'll be a pop star, 
All you have to change is everything you are." 
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears 
She's so pretty, that just ain't me 

Doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe
somethin 
A day in the life of someone else? 
Cuz I'm a hazard to myself 

Don't let me get me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Its bad when you annoy yourself 
So irritating 
Don't wanna be my friend no more 
I wanna be somebody else

Don't let me get me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Its bad when you annoy yourself 
So irritating 
Don't wanna be my friend no more 
I wanna be somebody else 

Doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe
somethin 
A day in the life of someone else? 
Don't let me get me 

Don't let me get me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Its bad when you annoy yourself 
So irritating 
Don't wanna be my friend no more 
I wanna be somebody else
