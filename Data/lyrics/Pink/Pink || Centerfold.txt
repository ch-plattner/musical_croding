I’m on the rebound
I get it when I want to
I’m on the way down
I’m getting fixed without you
You gave me a band aid
I put it on my heartbreak
And all you got is pictures in your hand

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn’t control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)
Don't you wish you could hold? 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn’t quite control
I walked away from you

Flip to me I’m the centerfold
I’m gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me I’m the centerfold
We’re gonna go on, hold tight

I’m gonna hate you
‘Til I forget you
So here’s a keep sake
I left it in the bathroom
Just a little something
Something to remind you
I’m sure you’ll never get this close again

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn’t control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)
Don't you wish you could hold 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn’t quite control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)

Flip to me I’m the centerfold
I’m gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me I’m the centerfold
We’re gonna go on, hold tight (hold tight)
Flip to me I’m the centerfold
I’m gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me I’m the centerfold
We’re gonna go on, hold tight

Now its him when it coulda been you
Tell me why it’s him when it shoulda been you
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change
Here’s an image you won’t forget
All your life I’ll tease, I’ll torment
I’ll be gone as soon as you turn the page

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn’t control
I walked away from you (yeah) 
Don't you wish you could hold 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn’t quite control
I walked away from you (oh, walked away from you)

Flip to me I’m the centerfold
I’m gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me I’m the centerfold
We’re gonna go on, hold tight
