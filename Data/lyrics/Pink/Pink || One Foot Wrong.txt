
Am I sweating
Or are these tears on my face?
Should I be hungry?
I can't remember the last time that I ate.
Call someone
I need a friend to talk me down

[Chorus:]
But one foot wrong
And I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it
Somebody gets it
But one foot wrong
And I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it
Somebody gets it
All the lights are on
But I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me
Who's gonna find me
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me
When I'm gone.

Does anyone see this?
Lucky me
I guess I'm the chosen one
Color and madness
First in line I put my money down
Some freedom
Is the tiniest cell in town

[Chorus]

Some people find the beauty in all of this
I go straight to the dark side of the abyss
If it's it bad
Is it always my fault?
Did somebody bring me down?
Did somebody bring me down?
Did somebody bring me down?

One foot wrong
I'm gonna fall
Put one foot wrong
And I'm gonna fall
But one foot wrong
And I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it
Just one foot wrong
And I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it
All the lights are on
But I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me
Who's gonna find me
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me
When I'm gone.

Have to love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Have to love me when I'm gone
You'll have to love me when I'm gone
