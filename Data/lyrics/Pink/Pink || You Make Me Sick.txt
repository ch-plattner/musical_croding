[Spoken]
They make me sick
I know I feel you, that's why we gotta stick together
Yep Yep Yep [laughs] I know it...

[Chorus:]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I'm feelin it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin again
Baby, you got me goin again
You make me sick

He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumpin Isley
He was gettin kinda close, kinda touch-ay
Cuz he had a little too much Hennessey 
He told me that he wanna go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "boo, I don't really know though"
He got closer to me...it started gettin deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

[Repeat Chorus]

In the 6 now, so hot
Gotta pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinkin bout the sheets now
Wonderin should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak...his body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screamin my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this...

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Can't..no no no
Oh, you make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin it...hatin it...hatin it
