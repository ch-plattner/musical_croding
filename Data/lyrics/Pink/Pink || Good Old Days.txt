1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years go by
I don't really know why I don't really know why
7, 8, 9, 11 years go by
I don't really know why I don't really know why
I still feel the same way I did when I was 17
I still look over my shoulder waitin for the world to change

But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I think I'd like to stay
I'd like to stay
I'd like to stay

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago
I didn't see a belly with a child on the inside
6, 7, 8, 10 years ago I thought I knew about love
I only knew about the fight
I look back and I realize all those times I was lonely
Praying for someday to hurry up and come and save me

But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
I wish I could stay

These are the good old days
I could stay
These are the good old days
And the more that you let it go
The faster the time goes
The darker the night is
The lighter the moon glows

These are the good old days
These are the good old days

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now
I hope I'm still getting down
I hope I'm still around
But 6, 7, 8, 10 beers ago
I had a revelation all is well right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now

These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay

These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay

These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
And I wish that I could stay
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay

These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
