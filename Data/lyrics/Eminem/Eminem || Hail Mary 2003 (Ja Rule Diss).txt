[Chorus]
Come get me
Motherfuckers if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

[Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a .12 gauge shotti

[Chorus 2x]

[Eminem]
You ain't no killer, you a pussy
That ecstasy got you all emotional and moushy
Bitches wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted
In the SOURCE, stealing 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouth, pray to god, hoping no ones listening
See 50 coming for me, I'ma guard my, my position
No one will pay attention
To me, please Gotti, here I go
Gimme this pill, ecstasy got me feeling so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fucking mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fuck from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted from these drugs, I'ma quit
Saying motherfucker's name's before someone fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker

[Eminem Sings]
Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

Get off that E
Before you try to fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La, la, la, la , la, la, la, la

[50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from the cell, G-Unit motherfucker, WE BALLING
Catch me counting trees when I'm calling
Can you set my car, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sips some more?"
Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared
Momma checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers think they can stop 50... they losing it
Lil' nigga named Ja, thinks he live like me
Talking about he left the hospital, took 9 like me

[50 Cent]
You living fantasies nigga
I'll Reject your Deposit
When yo lil sweet ass coming out of the closet
now he wondering why DMX blow him out
next time grown folks talking bitch close your mouth
Peep me I take this war shit deeply
Seen too many real niggas balling like these bitch niggas beat me
yous a motherfucking punk and you see me with gloves
quit scaring them fucking kids with ya ugly ass mug
and you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
but you and i know whats going on Nigga pay back I know your bitch ass from way back
Witness be strap with macs You know I don't play that
All these old rappers trying to advance its all over now -- take it like a man
HAHA--Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
trying to play hate on my shit - man eat a fat dick
Loving this shit, thats how you made me-feeling like I got you niggas crazy, i like
Against all odds up with my dogs motherfuckers now
It'll be the realist shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow to the truest shit i ever
spoke 21 gun salute

[Busta Rhymes:]
Hey yo I'm one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involving me for?
You spent a long time coming like a bless and a check
you see 106 and park fans don't even fucking respect you
It's kinda funny, wanna be PAC wanna be fake like he thug
running around talking shit that he ain't even capable of
now let me OFF this cock sucker watch me handle you nigga
If i recall Violator use to manage you nigga then took a closer look and
realized you was an empostor theres never been a Violator on a Murda Inc rosta. Dumb ass
now who shoot? -- Ah made you look, you said Busta singing the same old hook, You Stupid
if yall shoot I take a look at ya man the bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Chedda Bob ass nigga start adjusting ya plan
you let the streets down nigga - Apologize to ya fans
watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know where you are ya lil faggot
desperate be trying while we establish a buzz I know the shit is driving you crazy You wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what its like and "WHAT WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU"
You finished I ain't trying to repeat this just because I'm cool shouldn't
take my kindness for weakness

[Busta speaking in background]
Ooh shit ha ha That was fun Next time you got a problem with me, Address me
before you try to make the shit a public issue homie, I'm return back to my regular
self and have fun again
-One
