[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah
I'm in a different space in my life you know
It's a real good space too
Ayo Eminem I like this song man
By the time y'all hear this, Weezy probably be home
Welcome home Weezy
Reek Da Villain what up
Ayo
Let me tell y'all niggers about one of the little tough guy dreams i had the other night

Look
First I stop and then I drop and then cock another heater, pop another litre from another clip
He thought he was a creature that could never never ever ever ever ever ever get his shit popped off (Get his block knocked off)
When a nigger come and when a nigger front, gotta give it to him good, give a nigger what he wants
And if a nigger act up, shoot him in the head, in the face, in the stomach, in the foot or the heart
You don't want it homie, you don't wanna start especially when mo'fucker see the gun fire spark
When I got the gun up in ya mouth, I'll make a nigger gun talk 
Bush Rhymes Reek (black)
Imma hit him in the front homie hit him in the back
Keep on hitting that nigger in the chest cavity till the motherfucker layng down flat
Freeze motherfucker look
Trust me Imma make a nigger sit still
Anytime I gotta defend a fool nigger, it don't matter what it is, homie I will
Beat a nigger til you probably can't figure it out, I identify the mo'fucker on the reel
Word on everything a nigger really love, it don't matter who it is, homie I kill
But now I'm finally waking up out of the dream and I realise that life is so beautiful
And I ain't gotta put my hand on a nigger, unless it's definitely necessary otherwise it's unsuitable
Ha, going through a lot of different little things that make a nigger want to go and wanna get and wanna bring a couple goons out to handle a couple situations and let em elimination all the bullshit so I can sing
Run through every city, run through every state
Though we get a lot of love, I love to get a lot of hate
Though the ones who will try to hate will start to love cause it's undeniable that everything I do is great, even when I do it wrong Imma share it in a song and I'm questioning the words in the end all along
I guess I gotta die first return re-incarnated just to really see any other form
Until that time Imma sit and shine while I sit here with the grime, give me credit when it's mine 'fore I dent it with a 9 millimeter see the sign and the heater then I'm giving all my people get in line now 
Yeah
For the one's that hated, tried to stop my growth from the light from a ball Imma fight homie grudge, it's a Kanye song see the way I make a mother fucker don't know love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get em

I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's gonna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat them
They call me a freak because
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
Til my hip don't hop anymore
When you so good that you can't say it
Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless
I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me)
That's right, it (don't hurt me)
I don't need ya (no more)
Don't wanna see ya (no more)
Bitch you get no (love)
You showed me nothin' but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (around)
Don't hurt me (that's right)
You don't hurt me (and I don't need ya) no more
(Don't wanna see ya) no more
Bitch you get no love (no), no love (no), no love (no)
No love
Bitch you get no love (no), no love (no), no love
And I don't need ya (no more)
Bitch you get no (love)
