[Hook: Lazie Boi]
Cause baby I'm lonely
Can somebody hold me
It feel like I'm fallin now, I can't hold my ground
It feels like I'm only
Trying but slowly
It feels like I'm fallin now, I can't hold my ground
No more

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

[Hook]
