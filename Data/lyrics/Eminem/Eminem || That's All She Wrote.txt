[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 1]
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 2]
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 3]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote
