[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
is cause you denied seein me
Now I'm pissed off

[Eminem]
Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six-pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear somethin wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm (Obsesseed) now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me, in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up, 'fore I put all them phone calls out
you made to my house when you was (Wild'n Out) before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count
Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out
You probably think cause it's been so long
if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down
and sendin it to masterin to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do, Mariah it ever occur to you
that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky? Tell the public 
that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you
And don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin you
I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even third of the way through
"Damn Slim, Mariah play you," Mariah who?
Oh, did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I been goin off on you all this time
for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
on an episode of "Cribs," a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin your jibs
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is
It's a warnin shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and, I'll release every fuckin thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
when me and Luis were tryin to stick two CD's in the same slot

[Interlude]
"Slim Shady... "
"Slim Shady..."

[Eminem {Mariah Carey samples}]
{"I love you"} I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo
Now what you say? {"It's nothin"} Yeah so what I'll do
is refresh your memory when you said {"I want you"}
Now should I, keep goin or should we call truce?
{"You think you're cute, right?"} You bet your sweet ass I do
{"I'm Mary Poppins, B"} And I'm Superman, ooh
{"Mary P - Slim Shady"} Comin at you
So if you'll still be my {"Baby girl"}
Then I'll still be your {"Superhero"}
{"Wilma M."} Yeah, I'm right here
{"You like this!"} Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a {"knife"} when I tell you get a {"life"}
But I'm movin on with mine, Nick, is that your {"wife"}
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't {"stick to the script"} then I'ma just keep goin
Damn

[Outro]
"I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's sayin cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife!"
