[Chorus x2]
If I die young, bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Lil Wayne]
She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass
And now we're murderers, because we kill the time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
Young money thieves, steal your love with ease

[Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walk and if you're walking my way,
I'm that red bull now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I let you be the judge, n' n' and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder, coz she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bag

[Chorus x2]
If I die young, bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Eminem]
Man, if I could sing. I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't...
Now you probably get this picture from mu public persona
That I'm a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 
Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breaking
Should I just give up or live up to these excpetations?
now look, I love my daughter more than life itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell,
But I handle it ell, given the circmustances I'm dealt 
So many chances man, it's too bad coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm faceing, 3 felonies, 6 years of probation 
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's back, bent over backwards for this woman

[Chorus x2]
If I die young, bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
