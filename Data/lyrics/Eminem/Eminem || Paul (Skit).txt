Uh, listen I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the 'Just Lose It' video
And um, I mean he's pissed so I-I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this, um
Oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um, they heard a rumor that you got a new gun, um
I know it's probably not true, but I just need to talk to you about that
So, uh, give me a call [click]
