Oh, my goodness What have I done (oh no) I can't believe it
It's like... I've got the whole world
In my palm And I'm ready to drop bombs...
Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebecca
It's the village in new york right next to the try decca
It's my sector homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector
I said nice rectum I had a vasectomy hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually reck ya
Hannibal Lector into guy sex and I bet ya I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya
They said once bitten n twice shy
We lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir I took the rest of the lunester pills from my dresser
It's my kinda vibe what else shud I try lester
Drop, kick the bitch before the second trimester
Performed a home abortion with dexter the (ni yeser)
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends

All my west side bitches throw it up Put a balloon inside your pussy... queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showing up
So you better change the station
To keep from throwing up Man you seen it all before your all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't I won right by the pussy cat dolls when call you kitten
I'll pee on rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room
crazy glue in Madonna to The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine if visual for that man Who would've thoughta
Could ever be such a relentless prick
And leashin his fingers  For the chicks who waltz
She looks like she outlived her life sentence I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you (were(nt)) so defensive it wouldn't be
Your so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quick sand
Here you need a hand... big man... grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words... jeeze
So one last time, mister Christopher reeves Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please
(Christopher Reeves) Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)
Always hated you and I still do You'll never feel my shoes
My superman costume (sniff)
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you  You taking this shit too far (sniff)
Who d'you think you are (hang) my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more Throw down the cardboard
Lets break dance if you think your hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How shud I begin it and were does it all end
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends
