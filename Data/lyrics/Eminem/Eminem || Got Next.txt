
Shady records ain't nobody better than this
Shady records no cheddar than us 
Shady records ain't nobody better than this

[Chorus]
You can hate me all you want 
It don't phase me, its so crazy
I let these motherfuckers worry about what I'm doing
But they need to worry about them goddamn selves
I just do me 
You should be doing you not trying to copy on me
I got this locked from the burbs to the projects
Now none of you worry cause I got next

[Eminem]
This rap shit out I map shit strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success it's worked for me repeatedly
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
Let them diss you first respond immediately
In order to master art of war don't start a war shit not no more
We done scared them off there are no more
Victims to sick I'm fixing the pics 
I'm a start shit ain't got no pictures to rip
And shit to throw darts at 
Ain't got no more targets shit Irv and Jeff   
We don't beat em to death benzino in dept
Just be no one left to bully 
Bush is pussy, why the fuck you think in name's bush
Puss is bushy ain't shit going on shit I been getting so bored lately
I'm thinking of doing some shit
To get you to go and hate me again

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
Shit Dre's quitting Jay's quitting
Now its wanksta they're saying the same shit
It's ancient its fake 
Its making me so bored I'ma just make a new language
Fubba U cuppa cubba Uppa u Uppa Oobba
Youbba can Susubba my dadabbadick throug the tuba
Some other rumour lama I'm not a huma I'ma
Supersonic new robotic suicidal Unabomber
You think I'm the new osama
Press thinks I'm a new madonna
Jeffry Dahmer left me 
With his legacy to carry on a
Lot talk and rumors on us 
Who's the hottest to be honest 
Hip hop ain't been the same since tupac moved to cuba on us

Shady records ain't nobody better than this
Shady records no fucking more cheddar than us 
Shady records ain't nobody better than this
Shady records no fucking more cheddar than us

[Chorus]

You can hate all you want, but I don't give it a thought
Coz you don't know about me
Its really that simple, I can fit in a thimble whatcha
Know about me?
They ain't feeling my songs, I tell the haters be gone coz 
You don't know about me...better het use to the fact
That I be doing this tracks until they know about me

Shady records ain't nobody better than this
Shady records no cheddar than us 
Shady records ain't nobody better than this

[Chorus]
