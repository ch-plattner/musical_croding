Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy cos I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change/make your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me
Oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy cos I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Whoa yeah
