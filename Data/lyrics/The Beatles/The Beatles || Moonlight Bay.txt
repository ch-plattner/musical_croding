
We were sailing along (Twist and shout)
On Moonlight Bay (Ooh)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
They seemed to say (Keep on, Bongo)
You have borken my heart (Oh, twist and shout)
So go away

(Are the Beatles gone?

No, they're here.

Oh.)

With you big, far, hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay

Ooohhh
Yeah!
Ha ha!
