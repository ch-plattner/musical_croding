[John:] "Dear Wack! Please, ask thos gorgeous lads," ha, ha," called the Beatles
to sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the
Beatles, themselves, especially Paul," ha, "and everybody that was in the Roy

please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show.

[Brian:] All right, stop the band. Oh, that's splendid and now, what are you
