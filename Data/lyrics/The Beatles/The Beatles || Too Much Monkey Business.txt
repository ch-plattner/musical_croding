
Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow!

Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me
