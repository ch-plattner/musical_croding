
I'm gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he has the blues but he has a lotta fun
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary cumming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun, yea yea yea

We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun
Some fun tonight
