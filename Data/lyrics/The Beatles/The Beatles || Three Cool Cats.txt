Three cool cats
Are coming up in a beat up car
Spitting up a lift of candy bar
Talking on about how sharp they are
Three cool cats

Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
I think cool cats really did flip
Three cool chicks
Yeah three cool chicks

Well up came that first cool cat
He said, "Man look at that
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey man save once chick for me"
Hey, well three cool chicks
Three cool chicks

Well they love like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks
Made three fools out of three cool cats
Three cool cats

Well up came that first cool cat
He said, "Man look at that
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey man save one chick for me"
Yeah ah

Three cool chicks
Three cool chicks
They look like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
And three cool chicks
Made three fools out of three cool cats
Three cool cats

Three cool cats
Three cool cats

(Three cool cats, oh three cool cats.)
