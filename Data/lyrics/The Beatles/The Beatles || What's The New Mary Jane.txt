
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party

She like to be married with Yetti
He groving such cooky spagetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party

She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame

She looks as an African Queen

She tastes as Mongolian lamb

What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
