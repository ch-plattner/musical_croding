
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't wanna hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right

Some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

Some other guy, is makin' me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is makin' my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
I'm a-talkin' to you, right now
Ow!

Hey! Yeah!
