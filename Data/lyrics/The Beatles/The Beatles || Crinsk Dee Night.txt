[Brian Matthew:] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles. In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
[Paul:] Yes?
[John:] Hey! Listen!
[Paul:] It's all changed, now, Brian. They're not doing that, no actors.
[John:] It's all changed, now.
[Brian:] But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
[John:] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen the rest.
[Brian:] Yes?
[John:] Rubbish!
[Brian:] Was it, really?
[John:] Even worse, yes.
[Brian:] Who was worst?
[John:] Oh, Paul.
[Brian:] I see.
[Paul:] I think John was about the worst.
[John:] No, it was you.
[Paul:] Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.
[Brian:] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's right?
[John:] He was miming.
[Paul:] You, too, with Jason.
[John:] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
[Brian:] Beginning to look like that. Now, then--
[Ringo:] All right, John. Can you hear me?
[Paul:] Can you hear him? Hello!
[Brian:] Not really. I hope not. I hope not!
[John:] We brought you the flowers, Ring.
[Brian:] He's not allowed to talk.
[Ringo:] Eh?
[John:] We brought you the flowers.
[Ringo:] Oh, good.
[John:] And the grapes.
[Ringo:] Oh, I like grapes.
[Paul:] He likes grapes.
[George:] We've been to Portugal.
[Brian:] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
[All:] Who?
[Brian:] Los Beatles.
[John:] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh.
[Brian:] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
[John:] No. Crinsk dee Night?
[Brian:] Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
[John:] Right.
