Ain't no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Oo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

Yeah the goosepimples baby
Cos I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Oo mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over

Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Everytime you do
Well I feel glad all over
Oo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah!

Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak

Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Everytime you do
Well I feel glad all over
Oo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
