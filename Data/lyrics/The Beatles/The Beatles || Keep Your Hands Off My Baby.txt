
We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line

Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine

I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is somethin' that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch

Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but a one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Ow baby!

Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but a one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine

(Keep your hands) Who, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine (Keep your hands off my baby)
You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
