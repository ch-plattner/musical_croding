Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray, on the road to Masalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Not guilty
