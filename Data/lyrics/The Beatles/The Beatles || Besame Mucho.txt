Besame besame mucho
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine
So besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine

Cha-cha-boom!
Dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh besame besame mucho
Ooh I love you forever
You make all my dreams come true

Ooh this joy is something new
My arms they're holding you
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore"

Yes so dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dreams will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh so besame besame mucho
Yeah I love you forever
Make all my dreams come true

Ooh this joy is something new
My arms are holding you
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "it's you I adore"

Oh so dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh so besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love you for ever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love you for ever
Make all my dreams come true
