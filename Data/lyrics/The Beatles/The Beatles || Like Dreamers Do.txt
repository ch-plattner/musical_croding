I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love you

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

And I,
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you

You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know that I will love you

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

And I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you

You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know that I will love you

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
Oh like dreamers do
Like dreamers do
