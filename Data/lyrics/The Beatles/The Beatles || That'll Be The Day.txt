
That'll be the day, when you say good-bye, yes,
that'll be the day, when you make me cry.
Oh you say you're gonna leave,
when I die!
Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle
dovin',
All your hugs and kisses and your money too, you
say you love me baby, until you tell me,
maybe,That some day, well, I'll be through,
cause...
That'll be the day, when you make me cry, yes,
that'll be the day, when you say good-bye.
Oh you say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie ' cause that'll be the day
when I die!
When Cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me and you told me boldly
That someday well, I'll be through cause...
That'll be the day, when you say good-bye, yes,
that'll be the day, when you make me cry.
Oh you say you're gonna leave,
you know it's a lie ' cause that'll be the day
when I die!
That'll be the day oooh
That'll be the day oooh
That'll be the day oooh
That'll be the day.
