It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight,
It's you, you you you oooo oooo

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you oooo oooo

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now, feels so right now

Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the only one
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you oooo oooo

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now, feels so right now

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you oooo oooo
You oooo
