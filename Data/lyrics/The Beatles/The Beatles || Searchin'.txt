Gonna find her, gonna find her

Well searching
Yeah I'm gonna searching
Searching every which a-way yeh yeh
Oh lord I'm searching
Ny good lord, searching

Searching every which a-way yeh yeh yeh
But I'm like that northwest Mountie
You know I'll bring her in some day

Gonna find her, yeah ah, gonna find her

Well Charlie Chan, Simon Smith

Like a Bulldog Drummon
