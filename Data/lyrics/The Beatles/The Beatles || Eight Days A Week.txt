Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week

Love you every day girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Love you every day girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
