
To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do and I do
And I do

I'll be good to her
I'll make love to her
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I walk alongside of her
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do and I and I do And I do
And I and I do and I and I do and I

Why can't she see?
How blind can she be?
Some day, she'll see
That she was meant just for me, oh, oh

To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do and I and I do And I do
And I and I do and I and I do and I

Why can't she see?
How blind can she be?
Some day, she'll see
That she was meant just for me, oh, oh

To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do and I and I do And I do
And I do
