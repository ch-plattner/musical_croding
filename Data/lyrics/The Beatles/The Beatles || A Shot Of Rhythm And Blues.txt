
Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around

And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do

Get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do

Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Well, here's something for you to do
Well, here's something for you to do
