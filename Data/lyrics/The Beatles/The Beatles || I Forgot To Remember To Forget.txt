
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
