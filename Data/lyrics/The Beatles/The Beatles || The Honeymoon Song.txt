
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
The skys are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love

Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
