
They're really rocking in Boston
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down in Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down to New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen

Sweet little sixteen
She just got to have
About half a million
Framed autographs
Her wallet is filled with pictures
She get 'em one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch and look at her run boy who
Mommy mommy
Please may I go
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy daddy
I beg of you
Well please say it to mommy
It's all right with you
Ow!

Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown-up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's blowing high healed shoes
Well by tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her train
Become sweet sixteen
A back in class again

Yea cos they're really rocking in Boston
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down in Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down to New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen
