[Brian Matthew:] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[Paul:] We don't think so, really.
[Brian:] You don't ever think that?
[Paul:] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often.
[John:] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
[Brian:] Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John:] No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
[Brian:] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--"
[Paul:] Like riding a bus?
[Brian:] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
[Paul:] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
[John:] We go to certain ones.
[George:] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc!
[Brian:] Yeah, that figures.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know.
[George:] It is.
