
Where do you come from?
Tell me who you are
Do you come from another world
Or from some distant star?

Where do you come from?
Are you what you seem?
Are you real,
Are you standing there,
Or is it just a dream?

Tell me more about yourself
Do you feel the way I feel?
Are you just a vision,
Or are you really real?

Where do you come from?
Angel won't you say?
Tell me all that there is to know
And tell me that you'll stay.
