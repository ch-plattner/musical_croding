"Someday you'll find a love, son, to last eternally"
I want you with me everywhere I go
(I want you with me, I want you with me)
(I want you with me, I want you with me)
No, please don't leave me, baby, I love you so
(I want you with me, baby, I want you with me)

I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say that you'll be my girl
I want you with me in everything I do
(I want you with me, I want you with me
I want you with me, I want you with me)
Well, you know I need you, baby, I'm in love with you
(I want you with me, baby, I need it)

There is no mountain that I can't climb
You find the mountain, child, and I will find the time
I want you with me, with me night and day
(I want you with me, I want you with me
I want you with me, I want you with me)
Well, you can make me happy, baby, don't you go away
(I want you with me, baby, one more time)

I'll swim an ocean with a raging foam
If I know that you'll be there when I come back home
I want you with me, you know I love you so
(I want you with me, I want you with me
I want you with me, I want you with me)
Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never ever let you go
(I want you with me, baby, oh)

Yeah, I want you with me
(I want you with me, I want you with me)
I want you with me
(I want you with me, I want you with me)
Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never let you go
(I want you with me, baby, oh)
