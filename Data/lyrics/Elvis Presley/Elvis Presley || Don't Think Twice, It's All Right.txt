
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
It will never do anyhow

When your rooster's a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

An' it ain't no use in turning on your light, baby
The light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turning on your light, baby
I'm on the dark side of the road

But I wish there was something I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore

I'm a thinking and a wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long, honey, baby
Where I'm bound, I cannot tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just kinda say, "Fare thee well"

Now I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done a lot better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
