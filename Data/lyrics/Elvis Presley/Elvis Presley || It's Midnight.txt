
Maybe it's too late
Sometimes even hate myself
For loving you

Trying to be strong
Then night time comes along
And I start loving you, wanting you

Where is all my self control?
I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you

Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you

It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight

I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you

It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight

I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you

It's midnight and I miss you
