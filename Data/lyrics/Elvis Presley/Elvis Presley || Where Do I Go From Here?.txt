
Send me some lovin'
Send it, I pray
How can I keep loving you
Only when you're so far, far away?

Ooh, send me your kisses
Why don't you send it, my dear
So I can hold you
And pretend, yeah, you are here

Why don't you send me your kisses?
Honey, I can feel that great love
I need you so bad
I miss you, you so much

My, my days are so lonely
Honey, my nights, nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waitin' for you now, all my, all night long
