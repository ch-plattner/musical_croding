You got the huggin'est arms
The thrillin'est eyes
You're just my style
And you're just the right size
Gonna stop
Uh, shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Oh, the very first time
You touched my lips
Took my little red book
And tore it to bits
Ain't gonna be
Searchin' no more
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Ain't no other dolly I'm wantin' to hold
Hey, hey, baby
I really am sold on you
Ooh, ooh, such a pretty little package
I never did see
Gonna wrap you up and take you home with me
I'm thrilled like never before
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Ain't no other dolly I'm wantin' to hold
Hey, hey, baby
I really am sold on you
Ooh, ooh, such a pretty little package
I never did see
Gonna wrap you up and take you home with me
I'm thrilled like never before
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
I'm gonna stop
Uh shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Uh shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around
