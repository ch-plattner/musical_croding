
Don't leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through

Don't break my heart
This heart that loves you
They'll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now

What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust

Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now
