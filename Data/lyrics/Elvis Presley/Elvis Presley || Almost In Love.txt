
Your lips were made for kisses so tender
I'm almost in love tonight
When we are close, my heart says surrender
I'm almost in love tonight

And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight

It may be just the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight

Almost in love
