
As I walk along, I wonder
What went wrong with our love
Our love that was so strong

And as I still walk by
I think off the times we've had together
While our hearts were young

I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder
(I, I, I, I wonder)
Yo, baby
Why?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

You went away
And I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway

I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery

I wonder
(I, I, I, I wonder)
Yo, baby
Why?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

You went away and I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
