
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling down
Well you be a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town
Got no sleigh with reindeer
No sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin' in a big black caddilac
Oh, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground
Well you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town

Hang up your pretty stockings
And turn off the light
Santa Claus is comin' down your chimney tonight
Oh, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground
Well you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town
