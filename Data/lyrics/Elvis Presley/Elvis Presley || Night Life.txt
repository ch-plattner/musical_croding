Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
The chips are a spillin' and it's time to make a killin'
Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
Oh the pockets are a-burnin' and the money flies
With dice roll a-turnin' and you'll hit snakes eyes
You can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life

There're long legged women who will take you for a trimmin' yes it's night life
Oh night life.
Their lips taste like honey but they're out to spend your money
Yes it's night life. Oh yeh!
Just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
When seven come eleven it's a lucky streak
You can't beat the drama, the excitement and the glamour
Of the night life, I said that night life

So place your bet, come on make your play
Though you may regret it at the break of day
I said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life
Yeh! that night life, good ol' night life
Night life, yes, yes, night life, oh night life
