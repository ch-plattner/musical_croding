Just like an old grandfather's clock that won't stop running
Like an old racehorse that just wont ever quit
There'll be no end to loving you
Nothing can stop me once I start
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart

Well I'm as stubborn as a mule I just won't let up
Like an old bloodhound Ill hang around your trail
There'll be no end to loving you
Don't try to stop me if you're smart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart

Oooo- eeeee there'll be no turning back
Oooo- eeeee I'm gonna stay on your track
Just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
You'll find that I'm the kind who sticks to what I do
There'll be no end to loving you, baby we'll never be apart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart

Oooo- eeeee there'll be no turning back
Oooo- eeeee I'm gonna stay on your track
Just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
You'll find that I'm the kind who sticks to what I do
There'll be no end to loving you, baby we'll never be apart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
