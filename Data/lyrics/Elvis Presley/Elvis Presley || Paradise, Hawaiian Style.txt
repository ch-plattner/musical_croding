We're flyin', comin' your way
Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A.

Gee it's great, to be in that fiftieth state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle, where it's heaven tropical style
Where love weaves a spell, it seems

Hawaii, U.S.A., Hawaii..U.S.A..
We're flyin', comin' your way
Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A.

Gee what fun, just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress the sea
What a sight, those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you and me

Hawaii, U.S.A....Hawaii...U.S.A...Hawaii..U.S.A....
