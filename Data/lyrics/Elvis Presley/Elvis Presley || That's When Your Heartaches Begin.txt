If you find your sweetheart
in the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime
must come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin

Love is a thing
you never can share
If you bring a friend
into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart,
that's the end of your friend
That's when your heartaches begin
