
When my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

When the memories that linger in our hearts
Memories that make my heart cold
However some day they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
