
Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town

In Paris there is Mimi, and when the moon is bright
I love to take her walking, along the Seine each night
I kiss her on the left, then I kiss her on the right

Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town

I'm proud of my Brunhilda, in Frankfurt on the Rhine
Oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine
Oh she can lift a Steinway as easy as a stein

Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town

In Naples there's Maria how she can cook and flirt
You can't beat her lasagna, I eat until I hurt
And then she tops it off with "amore" for dessert

Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town
