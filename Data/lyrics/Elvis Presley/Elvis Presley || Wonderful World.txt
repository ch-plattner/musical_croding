
This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene

Up in the blue sky birds fly
And sing our cares away
And out of each throat each note
Greets a wonderful day

There is the sound of a symphony
Carried along on the breeze
Even the flowers are swaying in time
With the leaves on the trees

Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world

This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene

Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
