
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so in every way
I hope you will guide me
As only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
Around the dawn of each day
To always come true, dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
