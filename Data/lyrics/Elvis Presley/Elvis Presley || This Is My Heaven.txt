This is my heaven
Being here with you
Make it last forever
This is my heaven
It's a dream come true
Make it last forever
Come to me now
And take my hand
This is the paradise I plan
You're like an angel
Sent from up above
Let's stay close together
You brought me heaven
When I shared your love
Make it last forever
Here 'neath the sky beside the sea
This is my heaven
When you come to me
