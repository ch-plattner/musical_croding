
Suntanned, windblown, honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par, oh how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So, on and on it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel on high
With nothing to do but to give to you
And to give to me love forever true
