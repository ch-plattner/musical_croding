
Am I ready, can my heart be true?
Am I ready, to fall in love with you

One love, one girl,one dream shared by two
Am I ready, to fall in love with you

I have touched your lips,and now I know
I would be a fool, to let you go

Should I, could I, how I wish I knew
Am I ready, to fall in love with you

Should I, could I, how I wish I knew
Am I ready, to fall in love with you

Fall in love...with..you...
