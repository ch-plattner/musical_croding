
You know what it takes,
You've got it, baby.
You are the only one I chose.
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
Only you and heaven knows
About my troubles troubles troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You shouldn't have took away my loving
You know you thrill me from head to toe.
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose.
You got what you wanted, now you left me.
That's the way the story goes.
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles.

When it rains, it really pours.
