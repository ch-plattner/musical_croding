Don't you believe that she will be true
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you

Soldier boy tell me why do you cry
When you return she'll rush to your side
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you

So prove your love is true
She'll be there to say "I do"
And if you go o'er sea or land
She'll make you understand

While you're gone oh try to believe
Her love for you is really for real
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you

So prove your love is true
She'll be there to say "I do"
And if you go o'er sea or land
She'll make you understand

While you're gone oh try to believe
Her love for you is really for real
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
