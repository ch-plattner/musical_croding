Oh, the way I feel tonight
You better wrap me up good and tight
In your arms
In your arms

Just like a bee in a honeycomb
I'm gonna make myself right at home
In your arms
In your arms

Well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied
Just a little bit of lovin' that's bonafide
In your arms keep me tangled up all the time
Like a kitten with a ball of twine

Yeah baby, that's where I want to stay
For the rest of my natural days
In your arms
In your arms
