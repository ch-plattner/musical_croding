
Ooh yes we're comin' in loaded, Ooh yes we're comin' in loaded
I'll hold the boat steady brother like a rock
Full speed a head until we hit the dock
We're heading for home, the fishing was great
We're comin' in loaded 'cause we're all out of bait
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!

We gottem packed to the water-line
Some got away but the catch was fine
Never saw such big ones, m'man oh man,
We're comin' in loaded just as fast as we can
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!

I'm gonna see my baby soon as I get back
Knock on the door with my pockets packed
She'll look at me well she can't say no
We're comin' in loaded so come on let's go
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!
Oh well now yeah!
Yeah! we're comin' in loaded
