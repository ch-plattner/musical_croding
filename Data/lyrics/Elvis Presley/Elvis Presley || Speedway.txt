
Take a ton of bolt and steel
A whole lotta sweat, a set of wheels
On the Speedway
The flag is down, pistons pound
Plenty of engines ripping around .. on the Speedway

Go for the money and lead the pack
Push the throttle and burn the track
Curl and swirl like you doin' a dance
Speedway's comin' and now's your chance
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway

Stoke that pedal down to the floor
As much as you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more, more, more on the Speedway
On the Speedway

Take a spin, hit the brakes
A young little girl .. shivers and shakes
On the Speedway
Clear the way, comin' through
Kiss from your baby just pushin' you
On the Speedway

Go for the money and lead the pack
Push the throttle and burn the track
Curl and swirl like you doin' a dance
Speedway's comin' and now's your chance
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway

Stoke that pedal down to the floor
As much as you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more, more, more on the Speedway
On the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway
