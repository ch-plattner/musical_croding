
The girl I never loved
Will never know I cared
And all my dreams of her
Are dreams I'll never share
For I want her and I need her
And I know it might have been
But it ended long before it could begin

The kiss I never got
Somebody else will take
The plans I never made
Somebody else will make
Oh I'm lonely, I'm so lonely
'Cause it's her I'm thinking of
But she'll always be the girl I never loved
Never loved, never loved
