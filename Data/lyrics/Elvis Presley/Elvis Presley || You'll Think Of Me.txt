
I'm sorry now girl, but I must leave you
There's something deep inside my soul keeps calling me
The winter wind girl, will not deceive you
And in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me

You'll see me coming, you'll see me going
Don't ask me why, I'm just the kind needs to be free
Just like that outlaw wind keeps on a-blowin'
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me

Now I know you loved me just like I wanted
I know you'd follow me across an endless sea
But baby I've got a heart that's haunted
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me

Ah but you should know girl that I'll be crying
Out on that lonely road where not a soul can see
I'll shed my tears for a love that's dying
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me

The summer sun girl will bring a stranger
And he'll be better to you than I used to be
And when he takes you into his arms girl
Well, in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
You won't think of me

Then in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
You won't think of me
