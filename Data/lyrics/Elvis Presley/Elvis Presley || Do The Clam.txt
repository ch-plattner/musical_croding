N' listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach

Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam

You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
Moon ain't gonna last all night
Well, let's work up an appetite

Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam

Everybody's got that beat
Well, listen to those happy feet
Ain't you glad that you found out
What the Clam is all about

Do the Clam, do the Clam
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam

Do the Clam, do the Clam
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam
Dig right in n' do the Clam
