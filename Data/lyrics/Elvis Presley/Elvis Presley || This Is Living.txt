
This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me

It's good to laugh and sing
Don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile
Cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all
Life has got to be a ball

This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me

It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got

This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me

Don't wanna settle down
I gotta move around
I gotta lot of time
I'm gonna wait and find
The kinda girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do

This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me
