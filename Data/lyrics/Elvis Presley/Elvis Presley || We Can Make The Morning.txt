I just thought I heard a small voice crying
Looked again and saw that it was me
I feel like a little boy denying
That he fears the night 'cause he can't see

Then a larger thought said stop your crying
Don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
Fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
Time rolls back the shadows of your mind

It's a long, long lonely night
You can make the morning if you try
It's a long, long lonely night
Oh, we can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I
Together, together, together 

Loneliness is darkness' first companion
Spend the night alone and faith may bend
Share it all and see how fear starts fading
Chase away the shadows with a friend

Dawn's elusive light is just beginning
Now the day can push away the night
Dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
Hope creates a foothold for the light

It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I, Oh
Together 

It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
