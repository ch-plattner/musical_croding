And drink to a fool, a crazy fool
Who told his baby goodbye
Too late he found he loved her so much he wants to die

So drink to a fool, a crazy fool
Who told his baby goodbye
He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go

She's found, she's found, she's found
A new love buddy, he's a lucky guy
So drink to a fool, a crazy fool
Who told his baby goodbye
