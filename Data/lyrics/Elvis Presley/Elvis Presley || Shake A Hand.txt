Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
I'll take care of everything

Your troubles I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll stay close to you
Anyplace and anywhere

Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can

Be truthful to me,
I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you so
Till I don't know what to do

So, let's call it a day
I said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
And shake a hand ev'ry day

Shake a hand, shake a hand,
Shake a hand if you can
