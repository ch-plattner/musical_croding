
I woke up this morning and I tried to call you, mmm
But you weren't there and that put me in despair
So I thought that maybe I could lose my mind
In the countryside so I went for a ride

But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care

I decided to try just one more time
To let you know I really love you so
Before I arrived I saw you go away
With another guy, a tear filled my eye

But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care

A long time has past since that day I cried
Life is fine and I'm doin' fine
When I'm at home and I feel all alone
Well I think of you, try to get a message through

But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
