
Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
To cry their tears, blue river
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do
I held you so tight
You were out of my sight
I'm feelin' so low
But I gotta go
Blue river because you never really cared about me
From now on baby that's where I'm gonna be
Cryin' over you, by the river of blue
