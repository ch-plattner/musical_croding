
There are lots of girls in the mountains
And they're worth their weight in gold
When they're in my arms with their lovin' charms
A treasure chest I hold

Well there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see

There's such beauty there in the mountains
You can feel your knees growin' weak
Every single boy feels the height of joy
When he climbs that mountain peak

Well there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see

I said there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see
I ever did see
I ever did see
