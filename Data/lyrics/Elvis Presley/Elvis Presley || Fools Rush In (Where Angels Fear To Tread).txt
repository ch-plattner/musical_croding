
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

And I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in
