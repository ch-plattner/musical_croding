Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere
I would rather be

Let's, go to the fair
We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land
Honey you and me

[Chorus:]
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball

You can spend my pay
Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds
Honey I don't care

Take me there by sleigh
Roller skate or bike, anyway you like
But take me to the fair

I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball

You can spend my pay
Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds
Honey I don't care

Take me there by sleigh
Roller skate or bike, anyway you like
But take me to the fair

Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair
