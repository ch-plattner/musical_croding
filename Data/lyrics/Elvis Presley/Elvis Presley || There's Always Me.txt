When the evening shadows fall
And you're wondering who to call
For a little company
There's always me

If your great romance should end
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling you need never be
There's always me

I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here

Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
There's always me
