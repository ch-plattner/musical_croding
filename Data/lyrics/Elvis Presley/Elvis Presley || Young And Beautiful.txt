You're so young and beautiful and I love you so
Your lips so red, your eyes that shine
Shame the stars that glow
So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me

You're so young and beautiful, you're everything I love
Your angel smile, your gentle touch
Are all I'm dreaming of
Oh take this heart I offer you
And never set me free
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me
