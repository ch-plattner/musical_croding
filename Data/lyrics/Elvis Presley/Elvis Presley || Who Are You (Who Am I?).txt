Who are you, who am i? 
Are we more than strangers passing by? 
Is this your dream are you in mine? 
Are we really here or lost in time? 

Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are

Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are
