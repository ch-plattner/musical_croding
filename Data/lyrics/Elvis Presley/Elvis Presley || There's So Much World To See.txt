Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be
To try and tie guy like me
I could never settle down in a little sleepy town
There is so much world to see

Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy
Who has to break your heart

So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
There is so much world to see

Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy
Who has to break your heart

So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
There is so much world to see
For me, there's so much world to see
Yeah, yeah
