
If I should go, forget me never
Please say that you'll remember me
I pray the dreams we share together
Will shine on in your memory

Each time a star falls out of heaven
It leaves the sky a deeper blue
So if we part, forget me never
And don't forget my love for you
And don't forget my love for you
