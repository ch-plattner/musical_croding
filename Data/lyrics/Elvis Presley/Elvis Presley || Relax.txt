Relax, here we are alone
Relax, if the phone rings, let it
Just forget it, we're not at home

Cut loose, let your hair down honey
Unwind, turn the lights down low
Relax, let's uncork the stopper
Come to papa, come on let's go

Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear

Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, when the knock's invited
Don't you fight it, come on relax

Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear

Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, life is worth the livin'
When you're givin', come on relax

Relax.....mmmmm....let loose...mmmm...defrost....mmmmm...
