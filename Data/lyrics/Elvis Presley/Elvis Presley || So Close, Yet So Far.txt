
So close, yet so far from paradise
I hold, you in my arms, in paradise
Is mine, then you slip away
Like a child at play, and here am I
So close, yet so far from paradise

When you, are close to me, it's paradise
We kiss, oh my love, paradise
Is mine, then suddenly you're gone from me
Like a floating star, I see, and here am I
So close, yet so far from paradise

I reach out for you, but each time I do
I always find you gone
I know love is new, I'll take care of you
In my arms is where you belong

Just, a step away, are we from paradise
Take my hand, come away, to paradise
My love, I want you close to me
I need you desperately, oh here am I
Waiting for you
Here am I
Praying for you
Here am I, so close, yet so far from paradise
