Suppose no rose would ever grow again
Suppose no brook would ever flow again
Suppose no star should ever glow again
Suppose you didn't love me

Suppose there were no bees or butterflies
Suppose no bird should ever cross the skies
Suppose the sun should never never rise
Suppose you didn't love me

It's impossible to imagine a world without a star
But imagining no you is more impossible, by far
Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive 
Suppose you didn't love me

It's impossible to imagine a world without a star

Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive 
Suppose you didn't love me
Suppose you didn't love me
