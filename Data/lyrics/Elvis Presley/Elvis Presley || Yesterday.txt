
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now, it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I don't have the laugh, I used to weep
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly

Why'd she have to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now, I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
