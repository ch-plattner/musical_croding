
Some like their women short, some like them tall
I'll take them any size 'cause I love them all

I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord

Mmm
Some take just apple pie, some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take

I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord

Mmm
Some like just southern belles, they got a one track mind
I go for all the belles except the wedding kind

I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord

Some like their women short, some like them tall
I'll take them any size 'cause I love them all, Mmm
Some take just apple pie, some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take
