One good turn deserves another
Be my love, I'll be your lover
It's all part of nature's laws
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch yours.

If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm

Joy they say is in the giving
Come on give, make life worth living
Your welfare is my concern
Do a favour for me, I'll do one in return

If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm

Scratch me now a little lower
What a feeling do it slower
That's it, Hmm you're getting hot
Well I gotta admit, you just hit the spot

If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm

If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
