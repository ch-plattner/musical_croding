
How would you like to be?
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown

How would you like to be?
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin' up and down
And I could hop with you

Come on and smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little,
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me

Come on and smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little,
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me

How would you like to be?
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me

How would you like to be?
A little mocking bird
And you can sing me songs
Like I never heard

Come on and buzz a little, buzz a little
Sing a little, sing a little
Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me

Buzz, buzz, buzz a little
Do re mi a little
Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me

How would you like to be?
A little baby bear
And you can hug me tight
Any time you care

How would you like to be?
A little dancing doll
And you could dance with me
Everytime I call
