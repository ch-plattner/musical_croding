Every time I look at someone new
Tell me why I think of you
Then you sometimes ask me by
You're playing with love
Darling tell me why

You left me all alone
To cry over you
My heart is torn and broken
There's nothing left to do

In my prayers, I'll mention you
When you're gone I feel so blue
Why can't I have all of you
Oh, somebody, please tell me why
