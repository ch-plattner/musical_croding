
We've got to patch it up baby
Before we fall apart at the seams
We've got to patch it up baby
In the time we travel in our dreams
Let's go back and test it again
One more ride is all I ask
Get that feelin', that old feelin', it is here

We can patch it up baby,
We can patch it up baby,
We can patch it up baby,
Patch it up with all our dreams
We can patch it up baby,
Sweep out all the trouble of our heart
We've got to patch it up baby,
Before our difference pulls us apart

Let's go where the good luck lies
Let us give it one more try
Do you feel it? That old feelin'?
Do you feel it?
