
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
Because I know our love could never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me

The dreams I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I could not win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin
