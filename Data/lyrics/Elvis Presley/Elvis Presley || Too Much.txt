Honey, I love you too much
Need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch
Gee, I can't hold you too much
You do all the livin'
While I do all the givin'
Cause I love you too much

You spend all my money too much
Have to share you honey, too much
When I want some lovin', you're gone
Don't you know you're treatin' me wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
Cause I love you too much

Ev'ry time I kiss your sweet lips
I can feel my heart go flip flip
I'm such a fool for your charms
Take me back baby in your arms
Like to hear you sighin'
Even though I know you're lyin'
Cause I love you too much

Need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please, hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
Cause I love you too much
