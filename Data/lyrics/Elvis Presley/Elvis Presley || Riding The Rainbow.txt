I'm riding the rainbow
Hitting the highway to happiness
Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone
Whose meant to be mine

I'm living to love and loving to live
I've got a heart, I'm longing to give
I'm riding the rainbow
I'll follow that star to where you are

I'm riding the rainbow
Heading for heaven and happiness
I guess somebody somewhere
Someday will teach me to care

But being alone
Don't bother me
I'm free to have fun
It's fun to be free

I'm riding the rainbow
I'll follow that star
I'm riding the rainbow
To where you are
