Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think of her
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she moves
All I gotta do is think of her
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
