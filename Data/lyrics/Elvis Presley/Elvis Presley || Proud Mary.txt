
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been

Been a lot of places down in Memphis
I umped a lot of babes down in New Orleans
Had a lot of shots at good times in the city
Till I hitched a ride on a river bout queen

A big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on a river
Rollin, rollin, rollin on a river

If you come down to the river
I betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry
'Cause you have no money
People along the river are happy to give

I said a big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
