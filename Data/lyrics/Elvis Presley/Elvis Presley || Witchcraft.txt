Don't do that, please stop it
Please stop it now
You know I can't take it
Please stop it now

My head is spinning a spell on me now
My head is spinning around and around
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down

Let me forget her, don't mention her name
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she doesn't feel the same

I can't go on since she left me alone
My one desire now is to cry, now to cry
She might come back one day by and by and by
