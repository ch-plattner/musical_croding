To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving You?
And the kindness, You've shown

Lord Heavenly Jesus, I'm wasted and
So help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands

Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can ever repay, all I've taken from You
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You

Lord Heavenly Jesus, I praise Him
So help me Jesus, I know what I am, oh yes
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
