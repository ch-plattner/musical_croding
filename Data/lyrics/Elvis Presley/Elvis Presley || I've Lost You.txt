
Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind

I've Lost though you're near me
And your body's still this kind
I've lost you on a journey,
But I can't remember where or when

Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know

Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh

Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleeping to the door
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned to well

Oh I've lost you, oh, I've lost you
Oh, You won't admit it so
I've lost you on a journey,
But I can't remember where or when no more

Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh

Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
