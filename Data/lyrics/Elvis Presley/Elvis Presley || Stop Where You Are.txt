
Stop where you are
Don't move an inch
Don't come any closer now baby
You'll be in a pinch
Don't start what you can't finish
I warn you what's in store
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Stop where you are
You'd better freeze
Don't pull the fire now baby
Don't be a tease
Don't start what you can't finish
I told you once before
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Don't you know, you're walking on dangerous ground
Listen babe when I make love
I just don't fool around, no I don't
I just don't play around

Stop where you are
Just take it slow
Once I put my hands on you baby
I won't let you go
Don't start what you can't finish
One kiss and I want more
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Stop where you are
Don't move an inch
Stop where you are
You're gonna be in a pinch
Stop where you are
You're gonna get what you're looking for
