
We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been

We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
But we were just outsiders looking in

We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin

And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way
