He says he has the blues but
He has a lotta fun
Oh baby, yes baby, whoo-oo-oo-oo baby
Havin' some fun tonight yeah well!

Long tall Sally has a lot on the ball
And nobody cares if she's long and tall
Oh baby, yes baby, whoo-oo-oo-oo baby,
I'm having me some fun tonight

Well, I saw uncle John
With long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin'
And he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby, yes baby, whoo-oo-oo-oo baby
I'm havin' some fun tonight
