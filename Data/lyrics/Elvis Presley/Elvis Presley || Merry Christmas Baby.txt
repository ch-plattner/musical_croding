Sure did treat me nice
I said merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice

Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio

Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, yes, you did
Yes, you did, yes, you did, yes, you did
I said merry, merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice

Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

I said, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice

Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm puttin' it through Al's mike

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio

Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my, on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio

Well, I want to kiss you, baby
Underneath your mistletoe

I said merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
