The first time I saw you I knew I was hooked on somebody other than me
The first time I held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
Were as far as my eyes could see

Yes here in my arms I knew I had found the reason that I'm living for
And I felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
That I'd never felt before

Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming

Deep in my heart there's a feeling I never knew
Until I saw a love that was very new
I'm gonna tell everyone what good love can do

Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming

Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
