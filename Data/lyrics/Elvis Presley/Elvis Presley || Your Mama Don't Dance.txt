
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
But when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town,
Where do you go to rock and roll?

The old folks say that ya gotta end your date by ten;
If you're out on a date and you bring it home late, it's a sin.
There just ain't no excuse and you know you're gonna lose and never win,
I'll say it again.

And it's all because your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town,
Where do you go, to rock and roll?

You pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park,
You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark;
You're just about to groove, and you're thinking it's a breeze,
Then there's a light in your eye, and then a guy says,
Out of the car long hair, oowee
You're coming with me-the local police.

And it's all because your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll;
When evening rolls around, and it's time to go to town,
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
