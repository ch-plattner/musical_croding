
Give me the right
To hold you tonight
The tears that I've cried over you
Give me the right

You can't say no
When I need you so
I want you back in my arms
Give me the right

If you looked deep in your heart
Like I looked into mine
You'll find that nothing has changed
Our love was there all the time

Why make me plead
For something you need
I want to bring back the thrill
Give me the right
Give me the right
