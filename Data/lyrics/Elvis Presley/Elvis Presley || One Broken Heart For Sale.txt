
Who wants to buy a heart
One broken lover's heart
One broken heart for sale

Well, excuse me if you see me crying like a baby
Since she rejected me
There's nothing left to save me

Who wants to buy a heart
One broken lover's heart
One broken heart for sale

She would not listen to the things my heart was saying
She turned and walked away
And told me I was playing

Some guys have all the luck
And my heart hasn't any
I think I'll paint a sign
For sale for a penny

Who wants...
