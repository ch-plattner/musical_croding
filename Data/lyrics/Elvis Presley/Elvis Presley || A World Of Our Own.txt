
You kiss me darling, a miracle starts
A magic feeling, comes into our hearts
The spell of love began, when we're alone
And we're in, a world of our own

You say you want me, and music I hear
Touch me my darling, and clouds disappear
The sky is bright above, and cares have flown
And we're in, a world of our own

Holding you close, is heaven
Only I know, what it's worth
Knowing you're mine, forever
Is the greatest wonder on earth

Nothing can change it, the magic's begun
When we're together, our hearts become one
I find a happiness, I've never known
When we're in, a world of our own

When we're in...a world of our own
