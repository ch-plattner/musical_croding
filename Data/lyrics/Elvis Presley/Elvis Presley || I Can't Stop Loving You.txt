
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
