How the web was woven
In my soul, don't you know
How the web was woven
Can't get loose, can't let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart
I'm no longer free
At last I'm where you want me
Don't you know, that's where I want to be?

Spinning 'round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter, oh how I try
I can't sleep in my bed

I've been round for the last time
Oh, girl, what can I do?
Oh the time the web was woven,
How I fell in love, fell in love with you
