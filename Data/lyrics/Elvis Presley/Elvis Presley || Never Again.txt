
I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore
I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time

What will become of me when you're no longer here?
If I can't stop loving you
What am I to do?
You'll be free but where will I be?

Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone?
Now that love has come and gone
Like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing

Where do I go from here? Will I get over you?
If so, next time I'll be smart
I'll know before I start
A heart that don't care, don't get broken

I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
Never ever, never again, never again
