
Slowly but surely I'm gonna wear you down
Slowly but surely I'm gonna bring you round
To my way of thinking, my way of kissing, my way of lovin'
Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine

I ain't gonna rush ya', I'll let you meditate
Though I wanna crush ya' my arms will have to wait
I'll just take it easy, so nice and easy, real cool really
Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine

Oh yeah! Mm-mm, I've got a feelin' I'm not wasting my time
Oh yeah! When you get the message it's going to be fine
Slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn
Slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn
For what you've been missin' is my kind of kissin', my kind of lovin'
Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine

Oh yeah! Mm-mm, I've got a feelin' I'm not wasting my time
Oh yeah! When you get the message it's going to be fine
Slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn
Slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn
For what you've been missin' is my kind of kissin', my kind of lovin'
Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
