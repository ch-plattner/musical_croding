
When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hyp-notised
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day
Ever since that day you came my way
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning
At night I'm still the same
Do you remember that wonderful time
You held my hand and swore that you'll be mine
In front of preacher you said
"I do" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
