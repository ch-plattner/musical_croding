My baby's long and tall,
She's like a cannonball.
Say, everytime she loves me,
Lordly, you can hear me squall.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".

My baby knows just how
To treat me right.
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".

When my baby does what she does to me,
I climb the highest mountain,
Dive in the deepest sea.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".

My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine,
And when she kisses me,
I get high every time.
She cried, Oo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".
