Everybody listen to me
Put a smile on your face
There's no reason to be gloomy
This world's a wonderful place
So when I say again happy
Shout it out
Yeh, get happy now shout it out
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out

Hey there little girl don't be sad
There's such good times to be had
Count your blessings one by one
Life's a ball, after all have some fun

I said c'mon get happy, shout it out
Yeh, get happy now shout it out
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out

Now there's good feeling you can taste
While there's music life's no waste
While there's great things happening
There's no end to the joy life can bring

I said c'mon get happy, shout it out
Yeh, get happy now shout it out
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out

As long as there's somebody you can love
As long as bright stars shine above
You've got no reason to be blue
Think what it means when all your dreams come true

I said c'mon get happy, shout it out
Yeh, get happy now shout it out
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out

I said now there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out

There is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out
Shout it out
