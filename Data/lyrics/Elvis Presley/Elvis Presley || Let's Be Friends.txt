Don't be afraid, you and I were made the same little one
And I know what it's like when you feel left out of the game little one
But if you take this helping hand that I lift
Then we can smile together, let's be friends
The world that you see may seem to be a mystery to you
The night may be dark but hope very hard and dreams can come true
You live in silence but for once let's pretend
We're talking here together, let's be friends
You're not alone, I've always known that we'd get along
And someone I know says life is good and He can't be wrong
There's fun and laughter just waiting round the bend
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
