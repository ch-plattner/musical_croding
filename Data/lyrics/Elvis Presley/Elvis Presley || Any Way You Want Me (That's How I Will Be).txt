
I'll be a strong as a mountain,
Or weak as a willow tree,
Anyway you want me,
That's how I will be.

I'll be a tame as a baby,
Or wild as the raging sea,
Anyway you want me,
That's how I will be.

In your hand my heart is clay,
To take a mold as you may.
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me,
And in your arms I will stay.

I'll be a fool or a wise man,
My darling you hold the key,
Yes, anyway you want me,
That's how I will be,
I will be.
