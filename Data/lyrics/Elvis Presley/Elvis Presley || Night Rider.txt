
Night rider, night rider
You may think that it's the breeze
Whispering through the lonely trees
But it's only him a'flying round the bend
As the day comes to that end

Night rider, night rider
He came riding to town
As the sun was going down
Saw my baby and he smiled her heart away
Now what will I do today

Cautioned my baby to stay at home
Not to leave mama's side
She laughed when I told her take care, take care
Or you'll share in his midnight ride

Night rider, night rider
Since he stole around the side
I ain't had no peace of mind
Night rider, won't you let my baby be
Come on, send her back to me
