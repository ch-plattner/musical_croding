Shakin' up this here town tonight
Startin' tonight
Have a ball do it all startin' tonight

Grab your partner by the hand, 
Spread a blanket on the sand
Three a.m. go for a swim
Clothes and all jump right in
Tonight, startin' tonight
Let out the stops, call the cops, it's all right

'Course when the cops have come and gone
You'll just keep carrying on
Don't you worry if you land in jail
We'll forward your mail if you can't make bail
Tonight, startin' tonight
Have a ball do it all startin' tonight
Anything goes, everything goes, startin' tonight
Startin' tonight.
