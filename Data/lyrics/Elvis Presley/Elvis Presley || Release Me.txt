
Oh, please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again

Oh, I have found a new love dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Oh, release me, my darling let me go

Oh, please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again

Oh, please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again

Let me go
Oh, release me
My darling, let me go
Let me go, let me go
