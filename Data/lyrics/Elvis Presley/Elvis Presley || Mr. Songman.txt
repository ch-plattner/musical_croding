
Here's another dime for you, Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman

In your ivory covered house, safe behind your walls of glass
You keep staring back at me like a memory from the past
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold you in my arms again
I know memory's not re-living

But at least it's not the end
Here's another dime for you Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman

Won't you take away the night, sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold her in my arms again
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
