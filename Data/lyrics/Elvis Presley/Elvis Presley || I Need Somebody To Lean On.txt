
I need somebody to lean on
I need somebody to, to tell my troubles to
No use denying, I'm close to cryin'
But what good, tell me, what good would my crying do?

I need somebody to help me
Help me forget all those worries on my mind
And when I'm lonely, if someone would only
Want to be sweet and kind

I need somebody, won't that somebody
Please, please listen to my plea?
Need that somebody, won't that somebody
Come running to me?

I need somebody to lean on
I'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her
'Cause I need that shoulder to lean on, yes, I really do
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
