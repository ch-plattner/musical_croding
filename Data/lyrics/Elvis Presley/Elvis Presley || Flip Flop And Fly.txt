I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump

I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave .. Don't ever say goodbye
