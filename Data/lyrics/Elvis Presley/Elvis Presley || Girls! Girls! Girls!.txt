A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay
Girls, on the beaches, girls, oh, what a peaches
So pretty, Lord I could cry, I'm just a red blooded boy
And I can't stop thinkin' about

Girls, sailin' sailboats, girls, water skiin'
They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay
Girls, big and brassy, girls, small and sassy
Just give me one of each kind

I'm just a red blooded boy
And I can't stop thinkin' about
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!

And when I pick up a sandwich to munch
A crunchy crunchety, a crunchety crunch
I never ever get to finish my lunch
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of

Girls, in tight sweaters, girls, in short dresses
A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay
Girls, out boatin', girls, just a floatin'
So pretty, Lord I could cry

I'm just a red blooded boy
And I can't stop thinkin' about
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!
