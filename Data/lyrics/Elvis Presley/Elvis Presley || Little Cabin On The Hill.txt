
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems that there's a longing for you still
Oh but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin on the hill

Oh someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on our window pane
In our little cabin on the hill
