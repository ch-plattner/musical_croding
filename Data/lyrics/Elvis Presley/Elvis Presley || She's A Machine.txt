Well she's a..
Earth quakin', hip shakin', soul breakin', love makin' 
Machine...hey hey!!
She's a mad stalkin', smooth talkin', slow walkin' cat
You know what I mean..hey hey!!

She'll wrap those arms around you
Like a grizzly bear
She'll kiss you every fifteen minutes
And lets you up for air

Cause she's a earth quakin', hip shakin'
Soul breakin', love makin', machine

All right!!

Well she's a 
Wild movin', smooth groovin', clock tickin', love makin'
Machine...hey hey!!
She's a real breezin', rough squeezin', hell teasin' cat
You know what I mean...hey hey!!

She'll leer and make you like it
Sweet as she can be
She'll make you blow your mind before
You count to one-two-three

Cause she's a earth quakin', hip shakin'
Soul breakin', love makin', machine
