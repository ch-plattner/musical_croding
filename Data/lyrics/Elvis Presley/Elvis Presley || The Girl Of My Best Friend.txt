
The way she walks,
The way she talks
How long can I pretend
Oh I can't help I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

Her lovely hair,
Her skin so fair
I could go on and never end
Oh, I can't help I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

I want to tell her
How I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either one again

The way they kiss
Their happiness
Will my ache-in' ever end
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend?

Never end,
Will it ever end?
Please let it end
