
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born

And for every child on the beach that day
Stands a castle tall and proud
And the warm wind crawls through the castle walls
And the nightfolk wake as the warm wind calls

At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born

Then the fiddler crab plays his violin
On the back of a dancing whale
While the mermaid sing to the shell they bring
And the dragon leads with his sweeping tail

At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born

For the rosy dawn
Brings the children on to the beach that's bright and new
And the nightfolk know as the castles grow
They will play once more as the children do

At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
