My warped and worried mind resortd
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know but wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known

I wish all the time machine could take me back again
To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
Referring to her only as my little friend
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away

The child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume just knowing that she knew so much of life at such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things the big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment, fear and shame that first love brings
But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend

The fragrance of the green grass mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried and swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on and I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her and always gave a little more

Assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
