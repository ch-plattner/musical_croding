
Walk down to the beach at sunset
Look as far as you can see
You will find that endless ocean
And that's how my love will always be

I bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love

Look up at the sky at midnight
Gaze up on the starlit view
Just as heaven has no boundaries
Neither does my love for you

I bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love
Never ending love 
Never ending love 
Never ending love 
Never ending love
