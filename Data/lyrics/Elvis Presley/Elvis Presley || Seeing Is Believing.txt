Every time I see the sun rise
Or a mountain that's so high
Just by seeing is believing
I don't need to question why
When I see a mighty ocean
That rushes to the shore

If I ever had cause to doubt Him
I don't doubt Him anymore
Oh seeing, seeing, seeing is believing
And I see him everywhere
In the mountains, in the valley
Yes I know my God is there
Oh, in time I look above me
See the stars that fill the sky
How could there be any question
Only God can reach that high
