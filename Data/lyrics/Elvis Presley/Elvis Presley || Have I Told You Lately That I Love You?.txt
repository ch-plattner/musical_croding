Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well darling I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me?
Well darling I'm telling you now

My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling I'm telling you now

My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling I'm telling you now
