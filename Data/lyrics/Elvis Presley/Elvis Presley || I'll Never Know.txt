
How many stars are in the sky
I'll never know
What fire lights a firefly
I'll never know

What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand

I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know

What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand

I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know

What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know
