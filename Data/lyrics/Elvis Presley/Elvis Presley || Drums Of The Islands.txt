Drums of the islands you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home

If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And I'll return forever yours

I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
