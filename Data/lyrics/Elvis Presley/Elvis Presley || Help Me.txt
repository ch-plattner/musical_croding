Lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile
I'm tired of walkin' all alone
Lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile
You know I just can't make it on my own

I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me

Come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see
Just where I fit into Your master plan

I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me
