
I told her to leave me alone
That's what she's done
Just what she's done

And a house built for two, ain't a home
When it's lived in by one, one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps
Come right down the hall

Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall

She caught me lying
Then she caught a train
And I caught a fever
Walking home in the rain, oh yeah

But it's over and I'm done
She left me once and for all

Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
