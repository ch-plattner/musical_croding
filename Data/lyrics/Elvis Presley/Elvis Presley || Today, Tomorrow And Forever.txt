
I give, give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love

I vow we'll never part
Today, tomorrow and forever
Long as there's stars above

The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
So stay, stay in my arms
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love

I give, give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love

The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
So stay, stay in my arms
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
You'll always be my love
