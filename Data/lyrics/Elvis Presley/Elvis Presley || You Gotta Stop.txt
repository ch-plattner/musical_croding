
Baby you've been lying to me now I'm onto you
It's the same old song but it doesn't ring true

That's right you're wrong again
Time to change and put you on your own again
You've had your way too long
Time for me to be moving on

You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again

You've been steppin' out wild and fancy free
Now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop! 
That's all let's break it up
You've had me fooled now I'm wakin' up
I see right through your lies
You made me open my eyes

You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again

It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time

Nothing to say so I'll be on my way
Stop!

You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again

It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time

It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop! Stop! you're wrong again
Stop that song again
Stop! you're wrong again
You gotta stop that song again
Stop!
