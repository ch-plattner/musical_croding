(Young dreams of love, young dreams of love)
Young dreams (Young dreams, young dreams)
My heart is filled with young dreams (dreams)
And I'm longing to
Share them all with you

In my eyes, (my eyes, my eyes)
Oh can't you see in my eyes (in eyes)
That you're the only one who
Can make my young dreams come true

I have young arms
That wanna hold you (hold you)
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips (lips)
That want to kiss you (kiss you)
Kiss you morning noon and night
Take my hand (my hand my hand)
Oh darling take my hand (take hand)
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love

I have young arms
That wanna hold you (hold you)
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips (lips)
That want to kiss you (kiss you)
Kiss you morning noon and night
Take my hand (my hand my hand)
Oh darling take my hand (take hand)
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love
A part of all of my young dreams of love
(Young dreams of love, young dreams of love)
