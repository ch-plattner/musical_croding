My Jesus knows when I am Lonely
He knows each pain, He sees each care
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because He cares

My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, He knows just what I need

My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, He knows just what I need
