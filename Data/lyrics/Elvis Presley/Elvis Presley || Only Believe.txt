Lordy, only believe, only believe
All things are possible if you'll only believe
My Lordy, only believe, yes, only believe
All things are possible, if you'll only believe

I met God one morning, my soul feeling bad
Heart heavy laden, I felt [Incomprehensible] doubt ahead
Well, He lifted all my burdens
Yeah, right now I'm feeling glad
All things are possible, if you'll only believe

I believe, yeah, I believe
All things are possible, if you'll only believe
