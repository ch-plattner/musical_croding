
Ku-u-i-po I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow

See the sweet Hawaiian rose
See it blossom see it grow
That's the story of our love
Ever since we said hello

As the years go passing by
We'll recall our wedding day
I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say

Ku-u-i-po, you're my Hawaiian sweetheart
