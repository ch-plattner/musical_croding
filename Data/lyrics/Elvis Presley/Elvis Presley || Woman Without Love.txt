
Her eyes tell the story so well
She tries hard to hide
So little expected
Too often neglected,
A woman stripped of her pride

Always so careful not to cry
Not till I fall asleep
And there in the silence
She lies with a tear on her cheek

The thought comes to mind
That I've failed somehow
For things I can't quite recall

A man without love is only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
