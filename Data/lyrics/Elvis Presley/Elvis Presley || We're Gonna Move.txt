Yes, there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better home

We got no pane in this old window'
We got no pane in this old window'

Well there's a hole in the roof where the rain pours in
A hole in the floor where it drops right out again
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better home

Well there's a crack across the ceiling
Yes there's a crack across the ceiling
Well there's a crack across the ceiling
We're gonna find us a better home

We've gotta stove without a chimney
We've gotta stove without a chimney
What good's a stove without a chimney
We're gonna move to a better home

Pulling down window shades is no use at all
The kids and the neighbor can peep right through the wall
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better, move to a better
Move to a better home
