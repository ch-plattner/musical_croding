
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Tell me, will you or won't you need me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer

All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy

To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
