
I'll go on loving you
Don't ask me why
Don't know what else to do
Don't ask me why

How sad my heart would be
If you should go
Though you're not good for me
I want you so

It's not the kind
Of love I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without

You're all I'm longing for
Don't say good-bye
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why
