
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're gone
'Cause that could bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story now, my love
Right now there'll be no other time
And I can show you all my love

Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away
It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away
It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away, heart away, ya baby
