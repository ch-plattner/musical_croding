
First time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true

Must be beginner's luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are

I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves me
