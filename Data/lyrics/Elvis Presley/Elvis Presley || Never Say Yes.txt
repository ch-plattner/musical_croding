There ain't no holding back this child
I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun
Livin' just for a life of fun

Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes

Life has taught me one big lesson
Always keep the girl's guessin'
Tell 'em that you love them so
You hate to leave but you gotta go

That's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes

It's the oldest game in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it

And that's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I wanna to be

Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes

It's the oldest game in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it

Now that's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
And that's the kind of life for me
Being free like I wanna to be

Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
No, no, never say yes
