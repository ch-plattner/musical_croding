
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna tell my mama tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
And if you say good-bye
Say if you ever even try
