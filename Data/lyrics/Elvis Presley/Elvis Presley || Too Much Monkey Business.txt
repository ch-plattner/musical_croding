Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho

Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, settle down and get a home and and write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho

Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dial gone,
Well me ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho

Oh-ho-ho ...... Oh-ho-ho ...... Oh-ho-ho ...... Oh-ho-ho

Been to Vietnam, been a fightin' in the war
Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho

Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windo', check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho

Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down and and write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho
Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho, too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
