
Our friends all ask me
The last time I saw you
And I smile and tell them
It's been a day or two

There's no way to explain it
The way that I miss you
And my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue

I talk to your picture
My fav'rite one of you
I wish that you were here with me
But what good will it do

Having no way to tell you
The pain that I've been through
Oh, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
Yes, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
