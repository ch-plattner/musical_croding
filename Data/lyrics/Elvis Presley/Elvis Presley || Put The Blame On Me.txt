
If they say we were doin' wrong
If they say we were out too long
Well, you can say
My arms were just too strong
Put the blame, put the blame on me

Felt so good when I held you tight
Couldn't stop when we kissed goodnight
So if they tell us we don't heave the right
Put the blame, put the blame on me

What I feel is deep inside
This is real and I won't hide
Go ahead, use my name
I'll be proud to take the blame

You just did what I made you do
You love me and I love you
So if the way they talk can bother you
Put the blame, put the blame on me
