I can't conceal the tender feeling
Now that you are close to me
I look at you with tender feeling
And can't help kiss you tenderly

I offer you a true devotion
All life through my love I vow
For this is real, this sweet emotion
This tender feeling I have now

Somehow I knew from the moment our lips first met
You'd be the girl I could never forget
No other love could be appealing
I loved you right from the start
And with each kiss I'll keep revealing
The tender feeling in my heart
