It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life, days with a life of ease, oh-ho-oh
Well, I've got no job to worry me
No big bad boss to hurry me
It's a wonderful life life's good to me

It's a wonderful road
This road I'm travelin'
It's a wonderful road headin' beyond the hills, oh-ho-oh
Oh it may go straight or it may detour
But one thing that I know for sure
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me

Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't care where I'm goin'
Like the four winds are blowin' I go on
Laughin' the day away, lovin the night away
Till the moon is gone
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life
Livin' the life I love, oh yeah
Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me

Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't care where I'm goin'
Like the four winds are blowin' I go on
Laughin' the day away, lovin the night away
Till the moon is gone
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life
Livin' the life I love, oh yeah
Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me
What a wonderful life, life's good to me, yeah
Crazy life, life's good to me
Oh what a life
