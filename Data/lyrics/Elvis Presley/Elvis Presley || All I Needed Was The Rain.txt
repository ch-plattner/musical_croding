I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me

I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

Met a little honey
At the Buzzin' Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away

I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain
