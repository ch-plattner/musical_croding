
I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor

Singing ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying
