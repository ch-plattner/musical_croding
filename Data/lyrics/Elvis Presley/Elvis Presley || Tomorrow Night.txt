Tomorrow night
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night
Will all thrills be gone?
Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory,
Or just another lovely song
That's in my full heart to linger on?

Your lips are so tender,
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender.
Tell me, darling, will it last?

Tomorrow night
Will you be with me when the moon's bright?
Tomorrow night
Will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory
Or just another lovely song
That's in my full heart to linger on?

Your lips are so tender,
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender.
Tell me, darling, will it last?

Tomorrow night
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night
Will you say those lovely things
you said tonight?
