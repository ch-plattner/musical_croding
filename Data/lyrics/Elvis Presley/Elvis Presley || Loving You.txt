
(Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller)
I will spend my whole life through
loving you, loving you.
Winter, summer, spring-time, too,
loving you, loving you.
Makes no difference where I go or what I do.
You know that I'll always be loving you.

If I'm seen with someone new,
don't be blue, don't be blue.
I'll be faithful I'll be true;
always true, true to you.
There is only one for me, and you know who.
You know that I'll always be loving you.
