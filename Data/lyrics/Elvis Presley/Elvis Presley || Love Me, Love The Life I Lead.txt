If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead

If you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I
