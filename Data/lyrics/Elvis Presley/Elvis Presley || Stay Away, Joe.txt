Ho jump down, spin around, let's have a party
Look who's back, Stay Away Joe
Chock taw, chick a Shaw, gonna drink me hearty
Welcome back, Stay Away Joe

Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho

Who keeps turnin' up like a bad penny
Take one guess, Stay Away Joe
Always findin' trouble a-plenty
Oh my yes, I reckon you know

Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho

When two lips are right for the pickin'
Who crops up, Stay Away Joe
I love them and leave them screamin' 'n kickin'
Giddy up look at him look at him go

Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Hey
