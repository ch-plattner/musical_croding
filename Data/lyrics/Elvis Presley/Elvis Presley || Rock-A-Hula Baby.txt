(Fred Wise - Ben Weisman - Dolores Fuller)
The way she moves her hips to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really move the grass around

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance

I bet that she could teach the palms along the beach
To sway when breezes blow
And birds up in the sky could learn to fly
By watchin' how my baby can go
