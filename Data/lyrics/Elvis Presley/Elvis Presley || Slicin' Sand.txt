
Take off your shoes, put down your hair
Turn on the music and we'll get somewhere
Dance, dance, dance, til nose gets tan
We're gonna have us a ball on the beach
a-slicin' sand

Hug me a heap, swing me a lot
We got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot
O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, take my hand
We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun
a-slicin' sand

Come baby, come, let's dig some holes
You'll find it's heaven with sand on you soles
Yeah!

Slide through to the left, slide to the right
Slash down the middle baby hold me tight
O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, hold my hand
We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun
slicin' sand
