
When her motor's warm, and she's purrin' sweet
Buddy let me warn ya', you're on a one-way street
She'll crowd ya' close, spin your wheels
Then you're gonna know how it feels
To spinout, yeah spinout

Better watch those curves, never let her steer
If she can shake your nerves, boy
Then she can strip your gears
She'll get your high and goin' fast
Then she'll let you run out of gas
So spinout, yeah spinout

A road to love is full of, danger signs
Too many guys were lost who crossed those double lines

Don't you know she's out to prove, she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy
Like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, yeah spinout

A road to love is full of, danger signs
Too many guys were lost who crossed those double lines

Don't you know she's out to prove, she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy
Like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, spinout, spinout, alright
