
Acapulco, sleeping in the bay
Acapulco, wake up and greet the day
Time to tell the guitars and sleepy eyed stars

To be on their way
It's such a beautiful morning
For a holiday

Hey now come on, you old sleepy head
See the sky turning red and you're still in bed
It's fun in Acapulco

Acapulco, look here comes the sun
Acapulco, it's a day for fun

I can't wait till I meet your sweet senoritas
Kiss everyone
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun

I can't wait till I meet your sweet senoritas
Kiss everyone
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun

This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
