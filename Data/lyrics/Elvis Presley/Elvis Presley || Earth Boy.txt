Angel she be sweet and make him have happy heart
In land of love
Angel dream of earth boy, earth boy who'll be true
And love her till sun grow cold in land of love

Angel walk on street
Earth boy walking too
All at once they meet
Oo-oo-oo dreams come true
Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me

Angel walk on street
Earth boy walking too
All at once they meet
Oo-oo-oo dreams come true
Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me

Earth boy dream of angel
Angel dream of earth boy
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel dream of earth boy
Earth boy dream of angel
