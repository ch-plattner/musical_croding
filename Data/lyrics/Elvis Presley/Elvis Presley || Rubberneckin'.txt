It's called rubberneckin' baby well that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
People say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know
I like what I see and I see what I like, it gives me such a glow

First thing in the morning, last thing at night
I look, stare everywhere and see everything inside

Hey hey hey
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby well that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know
I see what I like and I like what I see, it gives me such a glow

Sittin' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else

Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care
I like what I see, I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow

Sittin' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else

Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
