Who makes my heart beat like thunder?
Who makes my temperature rise?
Who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture
With one burning glance, from her eyes

Marguerita...

Once I was free as a gypsy
A creature too wild to tame
Then suddenly I saw, Marguerita
And I was caught, like a moth in the flame

Marguerita...is her name

Marguerita...

Her lips have made me her prisoner
A slave to her every command
She captivates me, and intoxicates me
With one little touch of her hand

Marguerita....

Sweet...Marguerita...sweet, sweet Marguerita....
