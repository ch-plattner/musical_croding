I can explain about last night
Though things didn't look just right
Please believe me there was nothing wrong
I thought about you baby all night long
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie

Talk about a piece of rotten luck
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree
Very hard to handle like a model T
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie

Please believe me when I say
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
From you 'cause I don't have to look too hard
To see what I've got in my own back yard
So, please forgive me and forget

Don't say my alloy's all wet
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie

I wouldn't tell you no lie
No, no, no, no, no, no
I wouldn't tell you no lie
