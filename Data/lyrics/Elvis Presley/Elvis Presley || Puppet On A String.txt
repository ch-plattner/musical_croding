
Every time you look at me
I,m as helpless as can be
I become a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me

All you do is touch my hand
And your wish is my command
I become a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me

If you really love me
Darling please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find

Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me

If you really love me
Darling please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find

Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me
You can do 'most anything to me
