Well, that's all right now mama
That's all right with you
That's all right now mama, just anyway you do
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

My mama, she done told me, papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you"
But that's all right now, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

That's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
Well, that's all right now mama, anyway you do
