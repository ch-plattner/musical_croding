Hear that lonesome winter bird
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
