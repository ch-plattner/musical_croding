Take good care of her, take good care of her
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

I must accept it, she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy, that will be my consolation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

Take good care of her, take good care of her
