
Well, I've got a woman
Way cross town
She's good to me oh, yeah
Say. I've got a woman
Way cross town
She's good to me oh, yeah

She's here in the morning,
loving me
Yeah, she's a kind of friend to me

She says she love me early in the morning
Just for me
Oh, yeah you know she loves me
Oh, naturally

She's there to love me both day and night
No groans or fusses, treats me right
Never running in the street
Loving me alone
She knows a woman's place is around home at night

Well, she's my baby
And I'm her loving man
