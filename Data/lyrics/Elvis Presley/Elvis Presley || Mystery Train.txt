Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again

Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down, down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
She's mine, all, all mine

Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again
Never will again
(Ooh, woah)
