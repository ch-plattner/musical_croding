
May this tenderness cling
When the fire of Spring
Is a memory
May you still be my own
When a hundred years have flown

But if it can't be
Give this moment to me
While our dream is bright
Put your sweet arms around me
And love me tonight
Love me tonight
Let me feel your lips on mine

And though I pray
Forever and a day I'll be
Possessing you
I'll confess to you

If I knew that our love would be gone
With the stars in the dawn's grey light
I'd still hold you close and whisper
Love me tonight
