Oh Blessed Mother we pray to Thee
Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary
Only You can hold back
Your Holy Son's hand
Long enough for the whole world to understand

Hail Mary full of grace
The Lord is with Thee
Blessed are thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus
Oh Holy Mary dear Mother of God
Please pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
And give thanks once again
For the miracle of Your Rosary
