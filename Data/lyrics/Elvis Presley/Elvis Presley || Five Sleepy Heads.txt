
There were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye

There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr. Sandman came by
And then there were three

Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of Nod took one

Kissed the last one goodnight
Then I heard not a peep
There were five sleepyheads
Now they're all fast asleep
