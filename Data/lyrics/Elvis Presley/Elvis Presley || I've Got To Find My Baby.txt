
I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me

She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone

I've gotta find my baby
I gotta hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
'Cause I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone 

I've gotta find my baby
I've gotta find my baby
Gotta find my baby
