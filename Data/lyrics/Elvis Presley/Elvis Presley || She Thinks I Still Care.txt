
Oh just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
You know she thinks I, I still care

And just because I haunt the same old places
With a memory I will linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
Lord, you know, she thinks I still care

Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her
Yeh, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea

Yeh, oh lord

Just because I asked a friend about her
And you know, just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because, lord I saw her and went to pieces
Lord, you know, she thinks I, lord, still care

You know, she thinks I, I still care

Lord, she thinks I still care
Oh no she thinks I still care
