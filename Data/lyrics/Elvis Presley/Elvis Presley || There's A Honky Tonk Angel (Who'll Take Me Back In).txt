When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
Even longer since I felt like your man

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in

You never look at me and say, "I love you"
How much more do you think I can stand?
Oh, and there's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord, she's happy just holding my hand

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
