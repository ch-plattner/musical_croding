I said, "Take it easy, baby
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails flyin' all over the place
And the sweat poppin' out of my head"

She said, "Hey, bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to quit"
She said, "Go, bossa nova baby keep on dancin'
I'm about to have myself a fit"
Bossa nova, bossa nova

I said, "Hey little mama, let's sit down
Have a drink and dig the band"
She said, "Drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
I can dance with a drink in my hand"

She said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to drink"
She said, "Go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin', 'cause I ain't got time to think"
Bossa nova, bossa nova

I said, "Come on baby, it's hot in here
And it's oh so cool outside
If you lend me a dollar, I can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride"

She said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for I ain't got time for that"
She said, "Go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin' or I'll find myself another cat"
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
