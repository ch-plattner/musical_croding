Gotta do some livin', got the wanderlust
Better clear the highway 'cause I'm gonna move some dust
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along

Lots of pretty dollies try to fence me in
But I love 'em and leave 'em 'cause a tumbleweed's my kin
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along

Why do I keep movin', never settlin' down
Can it be I'm looking for a dream I haven't found
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along

Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along
