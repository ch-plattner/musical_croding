
Welcome to my world,
Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind

Knock and the door shall be open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine

I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
