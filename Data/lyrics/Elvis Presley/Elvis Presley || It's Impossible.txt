It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me?
And not feel you going through me
But the second that I never think of you?
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?
It's just impossible

And tomorrow should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?
It's just impossible

And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
(Impossible)

Oh, impossible
(Impossible)
Impossible
