Are you sincere when you say you love me too

And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere

Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too

And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere
