You're the one who beckoned the wind
And fanned the flame when our love began
So don't pretend you don't know me
Our names are carved on you, singing tree

Oh singing tree
Sing to me 
Call your friend 
The roving wind 
Maybe he can find my love
And bring her back, singing tree

Your leaves have turned from green to blue
Sometimes I think you loved her too
But since she left and our love died
You stand petrified, singing tree

Oh sing to me 
Singing tree 
Call your friend 
The roving wind 
Maybe he can find my love
And bring her back, singing tree

Oh sing to me 
Singing tree 
Call your friend
The roving wind
Maybe he can find my love
