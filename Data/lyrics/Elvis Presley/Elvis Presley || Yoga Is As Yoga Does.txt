Well I can see that you and yoga will never do

Yoga is as yoga does there's no in-between
Your either with it on the ball or you've blown the scene
I can see lookin' at you, you just can't get settled
How can I even move, twistin' like a pretzel

(Yoga is, yoga does)
(There's no in-between)
(Your either with it all the way) Or you've blown the scene
(Or you've blown the scene)

Come on come on, untwist my legs
Pull my arms a lot
How did I get so tied up
In this yoga knot
You tell me just how I can take this yoga serious
When all it ever gives to me is a pain in my posteriors

(Yoga is, yoga does)
(There's no in-between)
(Your either with it all the way) Or you've blown the scene
(Or you've blown the scene)

Stand upside down on your head, feet against the wall
A simple yoga exercise done by one and all
Now cross your eyes and hold your breath, look just like a clown
Yoga's sure to catch you if you come falling down

(Yoga is, yoga does)
(There's no in-between)
(Your either with it all the way) Or you've blown the scene
(Or you've blown the scene)

(Yoga is, yoga does)
(There's no in-between)
(Your either with it all the way) Or you've blown the scene
(Or you've blown the scene)
