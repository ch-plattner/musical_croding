
I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on

I need your arms
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home

When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so
