
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Good
Who never learned to read or write at all
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell

Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Good

His mama told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Good"
