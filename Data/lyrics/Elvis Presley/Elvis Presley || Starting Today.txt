
Starting today
I'm teaching my heart
Not to ache anymore
Just 'cause we're apart

No more will I dream
Of your sweet loving ways
Gonna learn to forget you
Starting today

And when memories haunt me
And the tears starts to flow
I'll just think of the sorrow
You caused me to know

No more for the past
To return will I pray
Gonna live for tomorrow
Starting today
Starting today
