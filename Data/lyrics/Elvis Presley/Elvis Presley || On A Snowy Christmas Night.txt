
Midnight's prayers so softly whispered in
A cathedral's candle light
Bring the message of the holidays
On a snowy Christmas night

Holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
Symbols of the season's might
Joyful faces everywhere you go
On a snowy Christmas night

Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night

Mother Nature wears a bridal gown
For the world is dressed in white
There's a silent glow that fills the earth
On a snowy Christmas night

Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night

For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
