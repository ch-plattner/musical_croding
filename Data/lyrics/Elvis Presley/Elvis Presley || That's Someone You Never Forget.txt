
The way she held your hand,
The little things you planned
Her memory is with you yet
That's someone you never forget

When she is far away
You'll think of her each day
And you know she'll wait for you
That's someone you never forget

Others may pass your way
And let you think their love is true
But you know that they'll never replace
The one that waits for you
