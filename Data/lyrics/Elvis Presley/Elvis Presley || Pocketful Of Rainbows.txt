I don't worry
Whenever skies are gray above
Got a pocketful of rainbows
Got a heart full of love

Mister Heartache
I've found a way to make him leave
Got a pocketful of rainbows
Got a star up in my sleeve

Kiss me extra tender
Hold me extra tight
'Cause I'm savin' your sweetness
For a lonely night, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

No more teardrops
Now that I've found a love so true
I got a pocketful of rainbows
Got an armful of you

Kiss me extra tender
Hold me extra tight
'Cause I'm savin' your sweetness
For a lonely night, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

No more heartaches
Now that I've found a love so true
Got a pocketful of rainbows
And an armful of you

Rainbows...
Rainbows...
