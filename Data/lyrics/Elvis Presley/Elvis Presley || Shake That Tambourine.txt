Shake a-ring a jing -jing a-ling
Shake, shake my little dancin' queen
Shake that tambourine, that tambourine

I can hear them dancing, in the marketplace
Swishin' and a-swirlin', in their' silks and lace
Bracelets keep a-clinking, on their' tiny feet
And with their tambourines they keep the beat

Rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
They make music, wherever they go
Pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb

Shake, shake the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a-jing-a-ling-a-ling
Shake,shake my little dancin' queen
That tambourine, that tambourine

I heard their talent, open palace doors
Every night they're dancin', on those marble floors
Kings may bow before them, but they'll be my own
Then they'll shake their thing for me alone

Rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
They make music, wherever they go
Pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb

Shake, shake the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a-jing-a-ling-a-ling
Shake,shake my little dancin' queen
That tambourine, that tambourine
