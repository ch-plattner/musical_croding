
She may say she needs fancy bangles and beads
That's part of a woman's plan
But what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man

Wise men have known women can't live alone
So a woman should understand
That what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man

He may not be the kind you find in picture books
A real life hero with dashing handsome looks
He may not be the guy that you've been dreaming of
But that won't stop you from giving him your love

So dear, can't you see that it was meant to be
It's part, part of our destiny
'Cause what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
And I hope that man is me
