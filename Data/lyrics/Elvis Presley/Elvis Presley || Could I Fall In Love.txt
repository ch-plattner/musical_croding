
Could I fall in love for the very first time
That's what I ask myself when you're lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
That's what I'd like to know when I hold you tight

Now that we're alone (Now that we're alone)
Just a kiss apart (Just a kiss apart)
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for you
