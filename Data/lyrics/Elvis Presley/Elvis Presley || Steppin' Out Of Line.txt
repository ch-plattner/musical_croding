
Listen, little lady,
You're steppin' out of line
What's your hurry baby,
You got a lot of time
That's not love you feel,
It's only make believe
Watch out, you'll break the heart
You're wearing on you sleeve

Cheating with your kisses
You think you know it all
Old worry gonna get you,
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down,
I see a danger sign,
'Cause the way you're steppin' around
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line
