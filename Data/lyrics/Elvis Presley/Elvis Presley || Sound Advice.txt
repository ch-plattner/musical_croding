They think they know more than you
They insist that they're givin' sound advice
But as sure as you're livin'
It ain't sound, it ain't nice
It just doesn't sound like sound advice

Some folks like to be the boss
They get up on their high horse
Oh they say that you're gettin, sound advice
There one thing I'm bettin'
It ain't wise, it ain't nice
You won't like the sound of their advice

Sound advice we're given
Just as sure as your as you're livin'
If your smart you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice

Sound advice we're given
Just as sure as your as you're livin'
If your smart you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice
Don't listen to their sound advice
