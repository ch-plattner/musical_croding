
Something old, the time goes buy
Something new, these tears I cry
Something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
And that's why I'm something blue

Something old, the vows we made
Something new, the price I paid
Something borrowed, love was tried but not true
Now my life is something blue

I guess that I had better smile
Walking behind you down the aisle
I feel I'm walking to my doom
I'm really not the best man in this room

Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two

Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two

And that's why,
And that's why I'm something blue
