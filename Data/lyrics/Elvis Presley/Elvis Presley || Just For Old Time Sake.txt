
Just for old time sake
Won't you give my heart a break
Let's get together again
Let's relive the time
I was yours and you were mine
Life was so wonderful then

I know, I know the day I let you go
I made my greatest mistake
If you loved me then
You could love me once again
Won't you try just for old time sake
