
Flip, flop with kay-eye
What a cutie pie I see
Oops shoopa doo-wah
Lips of honey that's for me 

Shim sham shimmie
I might forget you baby, there's no doubt
I saw you standing 'gainst the wall 
I whistled and I gave my all 
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call

Just a little kiss'll put me in a whirl
I'll never whistle dearie at another girl
You love me well we'll have a ball 
Why do you try to stall
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
