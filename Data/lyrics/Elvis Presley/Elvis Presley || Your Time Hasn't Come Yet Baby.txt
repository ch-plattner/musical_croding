
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a lot of dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
But when it does your heart will know

You're gonna be a beautiful woman
Because you're such a beautiful child
And when you start to bloom 
Just like a rose in June
I bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

Your life's still a lollipop heaven
Your teddy bear's at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

You're gonna grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile
And then a lucky guy will see you
And wanna walk you down the aisle, but meanwhile

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know
When it does your heart will know
When it does your heart will know
