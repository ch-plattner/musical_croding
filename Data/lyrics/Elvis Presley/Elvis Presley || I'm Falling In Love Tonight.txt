
I'm falling in love, tonight
Somehow, I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing, it's glow

When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you

'till you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One last kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame

But somehow, you've changed me dear
This time, it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
With you
