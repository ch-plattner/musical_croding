
When you say that's it boy
I'm finally beat
You're goin' ninety miles an hour
Down a dead end street

You don't want to fight no more
You think that you can't win
Come on boy take a real deep breath
Jump right in and 

Hold your head up high
Oh you gotta be strong
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song

Now they may take away your job
Take your fancy car
They may repossess your clothes, take that fine guitar
They may take everything you own
Well that's just for today
As long as you've got a song in your heart
Tomorrow's gonna be O.K.

Hold your head up high
Oh you gotta be strong
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song
All right

There ain't nothing gonna stop you
Once you've set your mind
The only people gonna knock you
Are jealous of what they find
Just keep a smile right on your face
Don't let 'em get you down
When you wake up tomorrow
The world is spinnin' round

Hold your head up high, hey, hey, hey
You gotta be strong, all right
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song
