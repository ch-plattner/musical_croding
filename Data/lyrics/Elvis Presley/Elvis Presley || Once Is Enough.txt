
All you got is one life
Living once can be rough
But if you live every day all the way
Once is enough

You can own just one suit
Worn and torn at the cuff
But if you're livin' the life that you love
Once is enough

What's the good of reaching ninety
If you waste eighty-nine
You got one life so live it
If you don't it's a crime

Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough

Never wait until tomorrow
What if it never comes
Life is a seven layer
Don't you settle for crumbs

Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
