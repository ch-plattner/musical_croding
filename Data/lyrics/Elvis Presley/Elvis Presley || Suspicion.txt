
Ev'rytime you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Ev'ry time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
you really, really, really love me
do you speak the same words
To someone else when I'm not there

Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion why torture me

Ev'rytime you call me
and tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
you're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just 
keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful 
whenever you're out of sight?

Darling, if you love me, 
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
these foolish fears out of my mind
How I hope and pray that 
our love will keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious 
'cause true love is so hard to find
