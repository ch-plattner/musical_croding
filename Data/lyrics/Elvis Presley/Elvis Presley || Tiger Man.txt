I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
If you cross my path
You take your own life in your hands

Yeah, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes runnin'
And the hound dogs get way back
Way back, way back, way back
Trace their way back

Yeah, well,  I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, well,  I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes runnin'
But the hound dogs trace their way back
Way back, way back, way back

Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
But the hound dogs trace their way back
Way back, way back, way back
