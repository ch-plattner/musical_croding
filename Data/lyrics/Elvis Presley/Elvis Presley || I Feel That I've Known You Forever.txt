
Your lips, your eyes, your soft sweet sights
I feel that I've known you forever
Your style, your touch, you're just too much
I feel that I've known you forever

I know that this never happened to me
Don't have to see anymore than I see
Your face so rare, beyond compare
I feel that I've known you forever
And ever and ever
