I'm just a roustabout
Shifted from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt...
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick "hello", and a fast goodbye

I'll go the way I want
Driftin' just like the sand
Doin' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

I'll be a rovin' roustabout...I'll be a rovin' roustabout

I'll be a rovin' roustabout..rovin', rovin' roustabout....
