Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell
I'll give you just another day

You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone

Tell me what you're gonna do?
You'd better make up your mind
It all depends on you
I'm leaving you behind

You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, no, no
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone, gone, yeah

Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again

You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, oh Lord
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone

You'd better find
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)

You better find out
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
Oh Lord
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)

If you don't, what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)

You'd better find
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
(Find out what's happening)
