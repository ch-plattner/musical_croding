I will be true
No matter what they may say
I will be true
Although you're far, far away

Each night I pray
All day I'll say silent prayers
That when I open my door
I'll find you there

Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain

Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true

That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain

Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true
