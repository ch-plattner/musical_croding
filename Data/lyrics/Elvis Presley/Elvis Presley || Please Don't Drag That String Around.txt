You like to keep me dangling on a string
'Cause you know without you my life don't mean a thing

So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
Oh, tell me, what would I do then
Keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end

Yes, I'm your puppet, my heart is in your hand
One twist of the wrist and I jump to your command

So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
What would I do then
Baby, keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end

I feel inside me, as sure as anything
One day I'll mean more to you than a puppet on a string

So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
Oh, tell me, what would I do then
Keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
