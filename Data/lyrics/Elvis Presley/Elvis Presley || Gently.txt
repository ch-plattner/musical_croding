
Gently your eyes met mine
Tender, trusting, true
Gently your hand took mine
Thrilled me through and through

Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Gently, oh so gently
Our true love was born

Gently your lips kissed mine
As we strolled along
Gently your heart touched mine
Young and warm and strong

Gently the hour is near
When true loves have to part
Gently we'll meet again
One more kiss, sweetheart
