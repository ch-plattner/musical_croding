
Ask me if I wanted to caress you
And I'd confess
Ask me if I'm longing to possess you
I'll answer yes

Now that we're together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go

There's no question that I care more than you
Love me darling, just be mine completely
And there's nothing I won't do if you
Just ask me
