
My wish came true
When I met you
I've searched and searched
My whole life through

There's just one thing
Dear before we start
Don't say you care
Then break my heart

When you speak of love
Please be sincere
For if you play with love
It can bring tears my dear

My wish came true
To my surprise
When you stood there before my eyes

And when my heart
Started beating fast
T'was then I knew
I found true love at last
