A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There's a moon that's big and bright in the milky way tonight
But the way you act you never would know it's there
So baby, time's a wasting
A lot of kisses I ain't been tasting
I don't know about you but I'm gonna get my share

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There's a balmy little breeze
That's whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting
Why don't you start co-operating
And the things I say are things you want to hear

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
