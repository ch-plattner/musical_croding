
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carryin' on

Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look

The ash trays are all full of ashes
The floor needs a touch of the mop
There's a man downstairs with a long bushy hair
He said your party was a three day rock

Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look

Baby, if you ever loved me
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law
Well, a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie
And trees won't grow in Arkansas

Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look

I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carryin' on

Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop

Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop
