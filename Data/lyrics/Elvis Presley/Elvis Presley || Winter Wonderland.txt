
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

I said
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
