Don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play
Don't you get a glow?

If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe, so

Come, get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come, hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot, so

Come, cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer "No, sir"
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go

Come, get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come, hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot, so

Come, cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer "No, sir"
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
