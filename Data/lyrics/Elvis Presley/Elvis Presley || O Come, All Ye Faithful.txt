O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
Glory to god, glory in the highest
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord
