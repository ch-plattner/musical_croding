Farewell, Royal High School,
We'll remember you.
Dear alma mater,
We're steadfast, loyal, and true.

As we go onward
In the lives we lead.
Your light will guide us,
Your motto is our creed.

We will look back fondly
At your ivy walls,
Recalling precious moments
Within your hallowed halls.

Farewell, Royal High School,
We'll remember you.
Dear alma mater,
We're steadfast, loyal, and true.
