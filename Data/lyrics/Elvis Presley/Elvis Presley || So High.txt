Well, He's so high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
Great God Almighty (you must come in at the door)

Oh well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
He's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I went down in the valley
You know I did over there ever stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day

Well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
And he's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I ain't been to heaven but I'm, I'm told
The streets the streets are pearls
You know the mighty mighty
Mighty gates are gold

And He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
He's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
And he's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
