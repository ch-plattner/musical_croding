
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
The don't abuse it
Never gonna loose it
I can't refuse it

Well, I've never been to England
But I kind of like the Beatles
So I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles
Can you feel it
Must be weary
Oh so good... oh feel so good

Well I've never been to heaven
But I've been in Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
What does it matter
