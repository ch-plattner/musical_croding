
Well hello there,
my it's been a long long time
How am I doin',
oh well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love,
I hope that he's doin' fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
that you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away

Gotta go now,
guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time your gonna pay

Well ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
