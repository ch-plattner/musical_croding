
You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness
Like before in you fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it,
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin', oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin', now it's gone, gone, gone

There's no tenderness in your eyes
When I reach out for you
Girl, you're starting to criticize
Every little thing I do
It makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying

You've lost that lovin' feelin', oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin', now it's gone, gone, gone

Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, love, love, love affair every day
Oh don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
Listen to me, talkin' to you

Bring back that lovin' feelin, oh, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin, now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
