
My love I offer you now
My heart and all it can give
For just as long as I live I'm yours
No arms but yours dear will do
My lips will always be true
My eyes can only see you, I'm yours

And as the years roll along
Your joy and tears I'll gladly share
And when things go wrong dear
Just hold out your hand and I'll be there
With every beat of my heart
With every breath that I take
Now and forever, sweetheart, I'm yours
