
I want my share of love, it might as well be known
But I ain't thinking of one girl to love alone
That ain't the way it's gonna be, I'm on my own and I am free
And I've been satisfied, so I don't wanna be tied

Somebody's loving arms can sure be sweet I've found
But I want no-one's arms to ever hold me down
Once I get caught inside a net I'm gonna run I bet
I'm gonna run and hide, I don't wanna be tied

I've seen lovers who were matched, they thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached, it seems that love just slipped away
Don't want no claims on me, 
don't want no chains that bind 
As anyone could see 
I say what's on my mind
Well there ain't nothing I conceal, I'm gonna play the field
The field of love is wide , 

I don't wanna be tied 
The field of love is wide, 
I don't wanna be tied 
The field of love is wide,
I don't wanna be tied 
I said I don't, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be tied
