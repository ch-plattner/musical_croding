I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay

He is my reason for living,
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession,
Oh, He is my everything

After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done

He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
