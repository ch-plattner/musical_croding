Western Union 
Oh, Western Union clickety clack
I had a fight with my baby
Ooh how sorry I am
She won't talk to me no how
I'm gonna send a telegram

Western Union oh yeah
Send my lovin' baby back to me

She won't open my letters
She won't answer the phone
When I'm a-ringin' her doorbell
She says there ain't nobody home

Western Union oh yeah
Send my lovin' baby back to me

Western Union oh yeah
Send my lovin' baby back to me

I love you is my message
Just three words and no more
If she won't let you deliver
Slip it underneath her door

Western Union oh yeah
Send my lovin' baby back to me

Western Union oh yeah
Send my lovin' baby back to me
