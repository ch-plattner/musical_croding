Let the stars fade and fall
And I won't care at all
As long as I have you

Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
As long as I have you

Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you

Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you

As long, as long as I have you
