
Well you may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down

Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down

Stop God almighty let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dews
Coming down on my bended knees
Talking to the man from Galilee
My God spoke and he spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God almighty let me tell you what he said

Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down

Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down

You may throw your rock and hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made the day and the night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light
You may run and hide, slip and slide
Trying to take the mote from your neighbour's eyes
As sure as God made the rich and poor
You gonna reap just what you sow

Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down

Some people go to church just to sit in the fire
Trying to make a date with the neighbour's wife
Brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone
Because one of these days mark my word
You think that brother is going to work
And you'll sneak up and knock on that door
That's all brother you'll knock no more

Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down
