I may not be here tomorrow
But I'm close beside you today
So lie to me a little, say you love me a lot
And I'll be true to you in my way

Love never goes on forever
At least that's what wise men all say
So smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry
But I'll be true to you in my way
Yes, I'll be true to you in my way
