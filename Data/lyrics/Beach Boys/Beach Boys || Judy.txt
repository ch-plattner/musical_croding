Oh Judy, do you hear me call your name
Oh Judy, do you really feel the same
Oh Judy, if I were you I'd take the blame

Judy, it's gettin' stronger every day
Oh Judy, I felt it's you in every way
My Judy, that's why you're always here to stay

I love you so
I want you to know
I can't let you
Give me a chance to show

Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Then Judy, tell me that you really care

Well Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Please Judy, tell me that you really care
