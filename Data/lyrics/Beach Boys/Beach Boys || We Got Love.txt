Are you taken by surprise
When your fellow man decides
That what you're doin' isn't right
Do you listen, know you're right

Well, you can keep on tellin' lies
That keep you deaf from people's cries
Well, there's somethin' you should see
We got love to keep us free

We got love, we got love
We got love and we gonna change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we gonna change our world, that's right

I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been ridin' all my feelin's
All this runnin' and my temperature won't change

Say, you reap just what you sow
The wise men all have told us so
Trust those feelin's deep within
How you must treat your fellow man

Evolution isn't strange
Nature itself demands a change
The universe is on our side
We can't hold back the comin' tide

We got love, we got love
We got love and we gonna change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we gonna change our world, that's right

I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been ridin' all my feelin's
All this runnin' and my temperature won't change
