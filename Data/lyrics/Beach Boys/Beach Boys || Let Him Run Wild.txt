
When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
But then one day he'll run in to one
That's gonna hurt him too
Before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
