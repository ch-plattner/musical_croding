
My heart was breakin'
Till you started making me
Feel like a natural man
My mind was mess
Until you brought happiness
And that's not hard to understand
When I'm through workin'
Just fussin' and cussin'
I'll be there just as quick as I can

Here comes the night
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me love me ooooo

I know livin' is takin' and givin'
Baby I'm givin' you my best
One of these days you know
I'm gonna go crazy
In the middle of your caress
When the day goes down
Honey I'll be around
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress

Here comes the night
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me love me ooooo

Every mornin' our love is reborn
And it lives with me all day long
Things start changin'
Take as a little rearrangin'
But our love grows on and on
Stars who shine in love
Are making you mine to love
I've never felt a love so strong

Here comes the night
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doin' alright
Hold me love me ooooo
