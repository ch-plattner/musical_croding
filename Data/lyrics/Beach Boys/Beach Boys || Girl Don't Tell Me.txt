Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer when
When I came up to stay with my grand
I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just a lie

Your hair's getting longer and your shorts
Mmm they sure fit you fine
I'll bet you went out
Every night during ol' school time
But this ti-I-ime I'm not gonna count on you
I'll see you this summer
And forget you when I go back to school

Girl Don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time

Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer when
When I came up to stay with my grand
Said I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just a lie

Girl Don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time

Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time
