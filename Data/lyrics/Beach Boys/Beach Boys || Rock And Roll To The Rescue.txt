There's a party goin' down at the rock'n'roll show
Baby get ready if you really wanna go
Now everybody's goin' to the rock'n'roll show

I saw some surfer girls in west L.A.
And right away it got me thinkin' 'bout my high school days
Well i was always kinda shy you know i never learned to dance
And i remember bein' nervous i was scared to take a chance
And it happened it was lookin' through my mamma's things...
I found some rock and roll records and i learned to sing!

Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

Now believe it when i tell ya that i never felt alive
Not 'til the night i started rockin' to my mamma's 45's
Well it was one for the money now and two for the show
Baby you better get a'ready now and go cat go!
Yeah the long tall Sally got me boppin' 'round the room
She sing be bop wadda loo bop a-whop bam boom

Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

So we got a band together now we're really quite the rage
Oh how i lose my inhibitions when i move across the stage
We're the hottest ticket goin' what a fantasy flight
They tell me fifty thousand people come to see us every night

Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock'n'roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

Gotta get a ticket cause i really gotta go
There's a party goin' down at the rock'n'roll show
Baby get ready if you really wanna go
Now everybody's goin' to the rock'n'roll show
