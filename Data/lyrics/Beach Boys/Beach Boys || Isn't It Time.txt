
I had to reach... 
The music spinning in our head 
Can't forget the feeling of 
The magic of that summer love 
Uh, I wanna take you there 
Do you wanna turn back and they just 
Remember is the photograph 
The world is changed 
And yet the game is still the same 

[Chorus x2:] 
Isn't it time we danced the night away 
How about doing it just like yesterday? 
Every time I think of you 
All of things we used to do 

Remember those nights we spent... 
Little deep we know how the time will fly 
Isn't it time, oh, oh 
Isn't it time, oh, oh 

But good times never have to end 
Now is the time to let them happen again 
We can have ourselves... 
Good time .. only in the past 

[Chorus x2:] 
Isn't it time we danced the night away 
How about doing it just like yesterday? 
Every time I think of you 
All of things we used to do 

And as the sun goes down we... 
To all the good times we share 
Isn't it time we go ready again 
Isn't it time we cross steady again? 

[Chorus:]
Isn't it time we danced the night away 
How about doing it just like yesterday? 
Every time I think of you 
All of things we used to do 

Remember those nights we spent... 
Little deep we know how the time will fly 
Isn't it time, oh, oh 
Isn't it time, oh, oh 

[Chorus:]
Isn't it time we danced the night away 
How about doing it just like yesterday? 
Every time I think of you 
All of things we used to do
