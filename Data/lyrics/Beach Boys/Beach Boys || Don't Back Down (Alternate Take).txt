Then turn and run for your life cause your not thrilled boy
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Just grit your teeth take it on but don't back down

Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
From that wave

I used to laugh when I saw a surfer go under
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Until I tried it and my ears sounded just like thunder
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
I know what it's like when you feel like backing down

Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
From that wave

It's just as scary as it looks and it's rough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
And if you're any kind of athlete you're tough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
You're gonna find out when you start backing down

Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
Don't back down don't back down
From that wave
