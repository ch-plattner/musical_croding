I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for a lost and gone
An unknown for a long long time

Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains
Once at night Catillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dudell do in a town full of heroes and villains

In the cantina
Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and
Round in the warmth of her body
Fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita don't you know that Im in love with you
Dance
Dance

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and  often wise

At three score and five
I'm very much alive
I still got the jive to survive with the heroes and villains
