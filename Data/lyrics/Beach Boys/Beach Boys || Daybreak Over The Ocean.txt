
Bring back, bring back my baby 
Daybreak over the ocean, 
Moonlight still on the sea 
I pray the waves gentle motion 
Bring my my baby back to me? 
And the stars sprinkle the morning, 
Venus fades form my sight 
Will my love be returning 
Like the Sun to brightening over my life? 
Days break over the ocean, 
Moonlight still on the sea 
I pray the waves gentle motion 
Bring my my baby back to me? 
Bring it back 
Oh, bring it back 
Bring my back my baby. 

Darling, if you could only 
Hear this song in my heart, 
Then you will know why you need, never feel lonely 
We'll soon be together, never to depart. 
And as long as there is an ocean, 
Long as stars are to shine 
Baby you will always have my devotion, have my devotion 
I'll love you pretty baby 
Till then end of time. 
And the days break over the ocean, 
Moonlight still on the sea 
I pray the waves gentle motion 
Bring my my baby back to me? 
Bring it back 
Oh, bring it back 
Bring my back my baby. 

[Intrumental break] 

As long as there is an ocean, 
Moonlight still on the sea 
I pray the waves gentle motion 
Will bring my baby to me. 

Darlin' if you should ever 
Wonder what you should do 
Baby you should know I'll love you forever. 
Maybe little darlin' that will see you through. 
And as the sunset set over the ocean 
And the world fades from you 
Baby always knew my love and devotion 
Will bright up the night 
Because I love you. 

Bring back, bring back 
Bring it back 
Bring back my baby 
Won't you? 
Bring back, bring back 
Bring it back 
Bring back my baby 
Won't you bring back my baby?
