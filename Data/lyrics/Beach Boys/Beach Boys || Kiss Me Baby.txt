Please don't let me argue anymore
I won't make you worry like before
Can't remember what we fought about
Late late last night we said it was over
But I remember when we thought it out
We both had a broken heart

Woah Baby
(Kiss me Baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)
Woah Baby
(Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)

As I drove away I felt a tear
It hit me I was losing someone dear
Told my folks I would be alright
Tossed and I turned, my head was so heavy
Then I wondered as it got light
Were you still awake like me?

Woah Baby
(Kiss me Baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)
Woah Baby
(Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)

Tight

Woah Baby
(Kiss me Baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)
Woah Baby
(Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)
Woah Baby
(Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you)
