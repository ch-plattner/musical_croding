Check my custom machine

Well she's metal flake blue with a corvette grill
(Check my custom machine)
And they say it looks better when she's standin' still
(Check my custom machine)
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

Well with naugahyde bucket seats in front and back
(Check my custom machine)
Everything is chrome, man, even my jack
(Check my custom machine)
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

With stereophonic speaker set with vibrasonic sound
(Check my custom machine)
Magnesium spokes, it stands an inch off the ground
(Check my custom machine)
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
