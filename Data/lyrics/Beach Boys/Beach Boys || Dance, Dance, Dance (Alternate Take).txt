
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way

You gotta dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on
The spot
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) Oooo

In my car a wild record drives me out of my tree
And I punch all the buttons for a station that swings

I love to dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on
The spot
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) Wow!

At a weekend dance we like to show up late
I play it cool when it's slow and jump it when it's fast

I love to dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on
The spot
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) Oooo

(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah!
