When in the mornin'
I must arise
I look in the mirror
It couldn't be clearer
Somethin' is gone from my eyes

Goin on
Goin on
Goin on

I know what is missin'
'Cause since you've been gone
My mind keeps on reelin' (mind keeps on reelin')
My heart keeps on feelin' (heart keeps on feelin')
Why is my love goin on (goin on)

Goin on
Goin on
Goin on

I love you
I miss you
Things won't be the same till I kiss you
I'm empty
Without you
My heart's full with my arms about you

Ooo ooo ooo ah ah ah

We said it was over
We're livin' apart
We couldn't quite make it (couldn't quite make it)
But still I can't shake it (but still I can't shake it)
Our love still lives on in my heart (in my heart)

Goin on
Goin on
Goin on

I love you
Forever
Love won't be the same again ever (same again ever)
Without you (without you)
I'm longing (I'm longing)
You gave me a sense of belonging

Oo oo oo oo oo goin on

Why is my love goin' on (goin on)
Goin' on
Goin' on
Goin' on

I love you
I miss you
I'm sorry
Forgive me (won't you forgive me)
Believe me (believe me)
My lover (my lover)
There never could be any other

Ooo oooo oooo Goin' on

Come be my
Redeemer
Awaken me beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)
I love you (I love you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Things won't be the same till I'm with you
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
