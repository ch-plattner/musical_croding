It's the little old lady from Pasadena
The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white Gardenias
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red super stocked Dodge
And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
You might drive a go-er but you'll never lose her
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
She's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She Drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
You'll see her all the time just gettin her kicks now
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
with her four speed stick and a four-two-six now
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
The guys come to race her from all around
But she'll give em a length then she'll shut em down
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She Drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
(Go Granny, Go Granny, Go Granny, Go)
