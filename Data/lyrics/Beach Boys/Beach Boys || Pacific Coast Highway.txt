
Rollin' along Pacific Coast Highway -
Bummin' along to my radio.
Saw a blond hitchin' my way;
Rolled up and said "How far do you wanna go?"
She'd been hummin', thumbin', hitchin' and wishin'
For a good day on Pacific Coast Highway.

Looked in at me; and when I could see her,
She seemed to be somebody I ought to know.
Opened the door; sat down beside me.
Then with a roar, we started to roll.
She'd been hummin', thumbin', hitchin' and wishin'
For a good day on Pacific Coast Highway.

Looked like a swan, but brown as Chuck Berry -
A summer's dawn, yeah, light as a fairy.
We got to town; she said her name was Mary.
She'd been hit, she'd been whipped,
She'd been hummin', she's been bummin' all her life.
(On the highway - On and on)
(On the highway - On and on)
