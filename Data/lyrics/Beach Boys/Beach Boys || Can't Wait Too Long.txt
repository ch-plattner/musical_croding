
Been too long

I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

Miss you so hard
Now
(Miss you darling)
Come back baby
And don't break my heart
How it goes

And now I'm alone lying down
Looking up at the stars
(Stars)
Relivin' the
Relivin' the times we shared when the moon the stars and the music was all

Been way too long
Been way too long baby
Way too long
Been way too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby

Baby you know that I
Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Windows of darkness are
All I can see through
Searching the shadows
Hoping to see you
Baby you know that I
Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Baby you know that I...
