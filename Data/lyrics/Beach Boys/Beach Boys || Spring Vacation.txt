
Driving around, living the dream
I'm cruising the town, I'm digging the scene
I'm not gonna stress, not gonna worry
Doing our best, no need to hurry
Looking ahead with anticipation
Making each day a new celebration
Seems like it could go on forever
As long as we can all stay together
We used to get around
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

As for the past, that's all behind us
Happier now, look what life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony boys is what we believe in

Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

Every night's special occasion.

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah
