In that soulful ol' man sunshine
She looks so fresh and sweet, keeps herself soft and tender
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
She looks so healthy, I feel so doggone wealthy
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby

So happy, together love is better in that soulful ol' man sunshine
Do-do-do

She wakes up singing songs, of happy everafters
Well let me just tell you 'bout my ever-lovin' lady
One bright September, I can remember
The morning we walked together laughin' in the sunshine

Hey old man shine your love on me
Hey old man shine your love on me
Soulful old man sunshine shine your light divine on me
Hey ol' man shine your love on me
Then suddenly the light shines through and I see you there standing before me
Today the world is new I feel so high and so far within you, yeah

Morning and evening, my love is weaving
A magical thread of joy that joins our hearts together
So happy, together love is better in that soulful old man sunshine
