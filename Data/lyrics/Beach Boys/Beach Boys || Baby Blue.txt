
Lie alone in bed at night
Feel the pull of a lonely day
Abstract music start to play
I wonder where you were today

(Baby blue)
Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I dream of you

Late at night
When the whole world's sleeping
I dream of you
Close to you I feel your sweet heart beating
I dream of you

Late at night late at night
Honey late at night I dream of you
I dream of you

Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I love you new
I hold you in my dreams tonight
Hold you 'til morning light

(Baby)
Baby baby blue
(Baby blue)
Baby blue eyes I dream of you
(Baby)
Baby baby blue
(Baby blue)
Baby blue eye I dream of you
(Baby)
Baby baby blue
