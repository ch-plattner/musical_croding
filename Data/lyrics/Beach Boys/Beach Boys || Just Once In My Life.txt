There's a lot of things I want
A lot of things that I'd like to be
But girl I don't foresee
A rags to riches story for me
I've given up on schemes
Cause everyone fell through
I've given up so many things
Don't ask me to give up on you

And baby baby
Just once in my life
Let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold onto
A good thing I found
Don't let me down
Baby say that you'll be staying

I couldn't face the day
If you weren't here by my side
And if you went away
Then I'd be left without any pride
There's just one little dream
I've got to make come true
There's just one round I've got to win
I can't be a loser with you

And baby baby
Just once in my life
Let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold onto
A good thing I found
Don't let me down
Baby say that you'll be staying

Every pot of gold
Ain't so easy to find
And if you'll stand by me
Girl I'll give you some of mine
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
Well I'll work hard
Every day
Baby don't leave me
Now say you won't leave me
Do this for me baby

Once in my life
Let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold onto
A good thing I found
Don't let me down
Baby say that
