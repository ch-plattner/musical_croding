
The Lord's prayer
Our Father,
Which art in heaven,
Hallowed be
Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On earth
As it is
In heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us
Our debts,
As we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not
Into temptation,
But deliver us
From evil.
For Thine
Is the kingdom,
And the power,
And the glory,
Forever...
Amen!
Amen!
