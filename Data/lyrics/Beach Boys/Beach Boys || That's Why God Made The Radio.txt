
Tuning in the latest star
From the dashboard of my car
Cruisin' at 7
Push button heaven
Capturing memories from afar
In my car

That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio

Feel the music in the air
Find a song to take us there
It's paradise when I lift up my antenna
Receiving your signal like a prayer
Like a prayer

That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio

Making this night a celebration
Spreading the love and sunshine
To a whole new generation
Whole new generation

That's why God made
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
