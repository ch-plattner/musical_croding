
Right there's the high school where we met
We'd sneak out back for a couple kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too late

She's gone
Chasing that highway wind
She's gone
She ain't coming back again

This ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bringing me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

We sat down on those courthouse steps
Fourth of July those fireworks over our heads
And they'd ring the bells of that little church
No there ain't nowhere I can look that doesn't hurt

She's gone
But I still feel her on my skin
She's gone
But she ain't coming back again

This ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bringing me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

I can't erase the memories
And I can't burn the whole place down

No this ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
To hell if I'm sticking around
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town
Oh yeah
Out of this goodbye town
I'm out of this town
So out of this town

Oh oh oh oh oh...

You'll be just a memory in the back of my mind
You'll be just a memory yeah
Oh, somewhere in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind, yeah
One day you're gonna look back at what we had
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me
When I'm long gone
I'll be long gone
