Slow down sister cause I just can't love ya
But I just can't get you off my mind

I ain't your fool, I'm not falling
I'm not falling in love with you
I play by my rules
And believe me
You don't want me too close to you

And even though you look so fine
I've been on this broken road one too many times

[Chorus]
So slow down sister cause I just can't love ya
But I just can't get you off my mind
Oh and Lord knows I need ya
But I just don't want to
Put this rusted heart upon the line

I've heard people say
That I'm crazy
That I'm crazy for avoiding you
But honey I got my freedom
And my reasons
All the reasons for what I do

But that last kiss just did me in
And I don't wanna look at you as something
More than a friend

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh slow down sister
I've got to make you mine
Oh all I'm asking for is just a little time
A little more time

[Repeat Chorus]
