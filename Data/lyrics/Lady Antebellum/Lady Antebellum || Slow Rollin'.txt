Everybody's got addictions, for me its gotta be you
So slip into something that don't take long
To slip in and bring me those baby blues,
El Dorado shined up, got a little extra cash
And a quarter tank of premium
Lets see how long it lasts

Baby jump in my Cadillac
You can slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can miss all over the FM dial
Sweet home country, Destiny's Child
Light turns red light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steering wheel's steady when you're ready girl

We can put a new spin on these wheels
Leanin' to an old school vinyl groove
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowing,
Slow rollin' this town with you

I can already hear you singing
I can already see your smile
Route forty-four leanin' on the door
Kick back crusin' down dine and shore,
Right passed the dollar general
Down to the end of the strip
Make a "U"-ey, hang a lou-ie
Feel that automatic shift

Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can dance all over the FM dial
Sweet Home country, Destiny's Child
Light turns red and light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steerin' wheels steady when you're ready girl

We can put a new spin on these wheels
Leanin' to an old school vinyl groove
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowin',
Slow rollin' this town with you

Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
Steerin' wheels steady when you're ready girl
We can put a new spin on these wheels
Leanin' to an old school vinyl groove
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowin',
Slow rollin' this town with you

Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can dance all over the FM dial
Sweet Home country, Destiny's Child
Light turns red light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steerin' wheels's steady when you're ready girl
Slow rollin' this town with you
