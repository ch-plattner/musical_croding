I felt this coming for a month or two
You don't look at me like you used to do
Still when you leave it's gonna be too soon
Give me a minute while we're still in it

[Chorus:]
Lie with me
Hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on
Lie with me

Go put your favorite Motown record on
Do what we need to feel it all night long
Make me believe you ain't already gone
Let's make our last time our best time

[Chorus:]
Lie with me
Hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on
Lie with me
Baby lie with me

Love me like you mean it
Like you're in it
You owe me that much now
Don't leave me here with nothin'
Give me somethin'
Baby what's the rush now

[Chorus:]
Lie with me
Hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower baby one last time
Lie with me
Hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on
Lie with me
Lie with me
Lie with me
