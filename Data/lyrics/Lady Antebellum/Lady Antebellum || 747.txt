
I could hear it through the line
I could tell from the crack in her voice
The static, the noise
There's leaving on her mind
When it comes to you
I'll do whatever I gotta do

I'm looking out from a window seat
Halfway back, aisle 23
Man I wish that I could fly this thing
Give a little more gas
A little more speed

[Chorus:]
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough

I could use a drink right now
I got my head in the clouds
Thinking about
The second that the wheels touch down
And my feet hit the ground
I run to your house
I knock on the door
Kiss you right on the mouth

[Chorus:]
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough

I'm looking out from a window seat
Halfway back, aisle 23
Man I wish that I could fly this thing
Give a little more gas
Just a little more speed

[Chorus:]
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This 747, 747
This 747 can't go fast enough, fast enough
