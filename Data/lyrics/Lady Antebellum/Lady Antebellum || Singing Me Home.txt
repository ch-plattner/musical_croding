My baby's riding shotgun
Singin just a little off key
Her feet on the dashboard
Tapping out the back beat
The song on the radio's
Is talking about the love we make
I know just what she's thinking
And I can't wait

Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)
Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)

Her tanline's showing
Out the waist of her cutoff jeans
Her damp hair blowing out the window
In the summer breeze
Got the sunshine
Shining through the windshield
Got a hand on her leg
The other on the wheel

Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)
Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)

Oh and when we get together
The love we make together
It blows my mind
Every time we touch
Oh I can't get enough

[Guitar Solo]

So slide on in a little closer
And lay your head here on my shoulder

Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)
Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
(Keep singing, love, keep singing)

Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
Oh my sweet love
Keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing me home

Wooohooo

Sunshine shining through the windshield
Got a hand on her leg
The other on the wheel

Love
Love
Love
Love
Love

Sing me home
Why don't you sing me home
