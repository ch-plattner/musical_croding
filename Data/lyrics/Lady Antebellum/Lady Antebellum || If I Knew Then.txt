
The first time that I saw you 
Looking like you did, 
We were young 
We were restless 
Just two clueless kids, 
But if I knew then 
What I know now 
I'd fall in love. 

You're on a bus in chicago 
Three rows to the left 
You know my heart 
Is reaching for you 
But we never even met 
If I knew then 
What I know now 
I'd fall in love. 

'cause love only comes 
Once in a while 
And knocks on your door 
And throws you a smile 
And takes every breath, 
Leaves every scar, 
Speaks through your soul 
And sings to your heart 
But if I knew then 
What I know now 
I'd fall in love. 

On a summer night 
In august 
Backseat of my car 
Said I'm trying to get 
To know you, 
I took it way to far 
But if I knew then 
What I know now 
I'd fall in love. 

(wooaahh) 
'cause love only comes 
Once in a while 
And knocks on your door 
And throws you a smile 
And takes every breath, 
Leaves every scar, 
Speaks through your soul 
And sings to your heart 
But if I knew then 
What I know now 
I'd fall in love. 

(woah) 
I used up 
A lot of chances 
But you give them back 
But if again 
It comes crawling 
Im gonna make it last.. 

'cause love only comes 
Once in a while 
And knocks on your door 
And throws you a smile 
It takes every breath, 
Leaves every scar, 
Speaks through your soul 
And sings to your heart 
But if I knew then 
What I know now 

(woah) 
If I knew then 
What I know now 

I'd fall in love...
