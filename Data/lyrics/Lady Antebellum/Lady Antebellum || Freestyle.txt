Ah, we gonna do this thing?
Well come on then

River road, Chevy van
Cherry Classic Coke can
Rolling on the floorboard
Fleetwood, Macklemore
Coming out the speakers
Spilling on our t-shirts
Getting loud
Like we're standing in the bleachers
Creek bank, tire swing
Pealing off our blue jeans
Skinny dip, show the fish a couple new things

[Chorus:]
Hey there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock and roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school ABC style
Maybe we could go a little wild and freestyle

Summer jam mix tape
Vodka in your lemonade
Alright, alright, like McConaunhey
White vinyl
Gypsy revival
Driving through the middle of the belt of the Bible
Hula girl grass skirt
Shaking on the dashboard
Where we're going we don't need no passport

[Chorus:]
Hey there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock and roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school ABC style
Maybe we could go a little wild and freestyle

Ah some of us like to watch
And some like to dance
Though we all wake up with the same
Stamp on our hands
Counting stars and counting cars
And just counting miles
Doing it freestyle
You style, me style
Ain't got no where to be child

[Chorus:]
Hey ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock and roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school ABC style
Maybe we could go a little wild and freestyle
Ah you can count it off baby 1, 2, 3 child
Maybe we could go a little wild and freestyle
