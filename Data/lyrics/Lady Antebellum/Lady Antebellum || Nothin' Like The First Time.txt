Last time I saw you I was fueling up
At our old favorite coffee shop
Then you walked up
I tried to hide behind my cup
When you said, how you've been doing,
I gave you the typical line
I've been fine
But I was lying, and dying, yeah
I was a kid in love
You rocked me then and it still does cause

Ain't nothin' like the first time
Nothin' like the first smile
Looking at you seeing forever
Keeps me going till the last mile
And I held on like crazy
Until our goodbye baby
And I still miss you lately
Ain't nothin' like the first time
Nothin' like the first time, yeah

I remember you stole my breath
Underneath the stadium steps
Now I'm walking 'round the block
Ten years later knock knock knock
Knocking on these memories
Flooding back of you and me
When love was free
We were shining, flying
Yeah, I didn't understand
I had you right there in my hands

Ain't nothin' like the first time
Nothin' like the first smile
Looking at you seeing forever
Keeps me going till the last mile
And I held on like crazy
Until our goodbye baby
And I still miss you lately
Ain't nothin' like the first time

First time
Never get it back again
But I still remember when
First time
First time
There's a magic in the way
You will always stay
Yeah

Oh oh oh
Ain't nothin' like the first time
Nothin' like the first smile
Looking at you seeing forever
Keeps me going till the last mile
And I held on like crazy
Until our goodbye baby
I still miss you lately
Ain't nothin' like the first time

There's a magic in the way
You will always stay
There's a magic in the way
You will always stay
