Everybody keeps telling me I'm such a lucky man 
Lookin at you standin there I know I am 
Barefooted beauty with eyes that blue 
The sun shine sure looks good on you 
I swear 

Oh I can't believe I finally found you baby 
Happy ever after, after all this time 
Oh there's gonna be some ups and downs 
but with you to wrap my arms around 
I'm fine 

So baby, hold on tight 
Don't let go 
Hold onto the love we're making 
Cause baby when the ground starts shakin 
You gotta know when you've got a good thing 

You know you keep on bringin out the best of me 
And I need you now even more than the air I breathe 
You can make me laugh when I wanna cry 
This will last forever I just know, I know 

So baby, hold on tight 
Don't let go 
Hold onto the love we're making 
Cause baby when the ground starts shakin 
You gotta know when you've gotta good thing 

We got a good thing, baby, woah 
So hold on tight 
Baby, don't let go 
Hold onto the love we're making 
Cause baby when the ground starts shakin 
You gotta know, oh you gotta know 
Oh you gotta know, you gotta know 
When you got a good thing 

We got a good thing baby 
Woah, woah, woah, woah
