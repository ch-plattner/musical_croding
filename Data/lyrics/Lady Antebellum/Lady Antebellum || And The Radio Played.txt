I remember riding shotgun in daddy's Chevrolet,
We'd crank up The Pioneers, and we'd sing away,
Sometimes he let me take the wheel and we'd drive through town,
Couldn't wait to hear my favorite songs coming back around (back around),

And the radio played, Old Flame, I'll Still Be Loving you,
I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool, Forever and Ever Amen,
Always On My mind again and again, Swinging and Smoky Mountain Rain,
He Stopped Loving Her Today.
We laughed, we cried the 80's away,
And the radio played...

Bobby was the first boy that I ever kissed,
I can still taste the root beer on his lips,
We'd turn up the stereo from that bedroom,
Climb through the window and make out on the roof.

And the radio played, Don't Rock the Jukebox and the Dance
Strawberry Wine and Brand New Man, Love Without End Amen,
Time Marches on, again and again, Meet in the Middle and Amazed,
Does He Love You?, Independence Day,
We laughed we cried the 90's away,
And the radio played...

I was (raised on the radio [x3])
Yeah, and the radio played
I was (raised on the radio [x3])

And I hear 'em now,
I'm right back in that place
And 20 years from now,
I'll look back on today

When the radio played I Hope You'll Dance, You'll Think of Me,
What Hurts the Most, Before He Cheats
I Don't Want this Night to End,
The House that Built Me, Remember When,
Love Story, She's My Kind of Rain,
She's Country Forever and for Always,
Don't Blink, I Saw God Today
And the radio plays..

I was (raised on the radio [x3])
And the radio plays
I was (raised on the radio [x3])

Weren't you (raised on the radio [x3])
I was (raised on the radio [x3])
