
Hang all the mistletoe
I’m gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it’s gonna be together
This Christmas
Fireside is pleasing bright
We’re caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a very special Christmas for me

Presents will come to here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas
Fireside is pleasing bright
We’re caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a very special Christmas for me

The fireside is pleasing bright (pleasing bright)
We’re caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a very special Christmas for me
And this Christmas
Will be a very special Christmas for me
