
I’ll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
With a love like this
And I’ll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Please have snow and lots of mistletoe
And presents under the tree

And Christmas Eve will find me
With a love like this
And I’ll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

If only in my dreams
