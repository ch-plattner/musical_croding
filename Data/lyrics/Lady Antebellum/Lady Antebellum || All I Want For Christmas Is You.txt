Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you Baby
You Baby

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you Baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singin'
I hear those sleigh bells ringin'
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Oh bring my baby to me

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm askin' for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you Baby
You Baby
You Baby
You
