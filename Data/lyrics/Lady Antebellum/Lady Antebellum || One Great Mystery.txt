
I don't know how many stars fill the sky
I know we're here but I don't know why
Maybe there's some other life out there
But as long as you're here with me baby
I don't really care

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
And I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do
To make you fall for me

Don't know what happens when we leave this world
But I know I'll go right on loving you girl
I'll close my eyes and drift off into the blue
And if I go first I will wait for you

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
And I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do
To make you fall for me

I guess I'll never really know
How I deserve someone that loves me so

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do
To make you fall for me
I'll keep asking through eternity
What did I ever do
To make you fall for me

What did I do baby?
Ooh ah
