
Standing by the door
Checking my hair
Waiting on you to take me nowhere
We were always looking for a rock and roll Saturday night
Sittin' on hold with the radio station
Listen all night to hear my dedication
A song to tell the whole town you were mine, that's right

[Chorus:]
And we sang
Like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change
And we danced
Like time wasn't really slippin' through our hands
Oh when you said I love you, you mighta been lying
But it sure sounded good at the time

Just a hand me down Pontiac
We'd see how many friends we could pile in the back
Saved all summer for a ticket on the front row, let's go
Didn't have a plan and we ran outta money
Car broke down but it's still kinda funny
Cause we hitched a ride with some hippie guy
And barely made it to the show

[Chorus:]
And we sang
Like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change
And we danced
Like time wasn't really slippin' through our hands
We made it back alive, made up a good lie
But it sure sounded good at the time

We did some wrong, we did it right
But it sure sounded so good at the time
When you were mine, alright
Whoa oh, alright

[Chorus:]
And we sang
Like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change
And we danced
Like time wasn't really slippin' through our hands
We swore we'd never say goodbye
And it sure sounded good at the time

Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah
Just a melody on my mind
Swore we'd never say goodbye
We sang on and on and on
On and on
