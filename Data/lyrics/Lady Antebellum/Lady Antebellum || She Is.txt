
She hails from Boston
She hates the sound that goodbye's make
She loves Sundays and champagne
She can't stand the winter
She can't stand anything that she can't change
Oh but she can't change

[Chorus:]
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world at her fingertips
She makes beauty look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is

Well we talk for hours
But she wrote the book on hard to get
No it don't matter what I say
I could buy her flowers
But that's just too clich√© to impress a girl like her
But you know I kinda like it that way

[Chorus:]
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world at her fingertips
She makes beauty look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
She is, oh she is

All I think about
And I can't do without
The good, the bad, the somewhere in between
Oh cause I want everything she is

[Chorus:]
Whatever she wants to be
She's a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world at her fingertips
And she makes beauty look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is
She is, she is
Oh mixed up, so tough
Yeah she's got a little of everything
And I can't get enough

She hails from Boston
She hates the sound that goodbye's make
