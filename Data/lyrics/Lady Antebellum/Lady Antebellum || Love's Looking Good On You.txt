Oooh, baby, baby
Something's just a little bit different in your eyes tonight
They look twice as bright
Oooh, baby, baby
Something's changed that I can't quite put my finger on
Well I've been rackin' my brain
Wait just a minute
Hold on, now
Well I get it

[Chorus]
Love, love, love's lookin' good, good, good on you
Well can you feel it, oh everybody sees it
How your sweet smile has a way of lighting up a room
Yeah you shine like diamonds in everything you do
Oh love, love, love's lookin' good, good, good on you

Oooh, baby, baby
Isn't it funny how we don't need any money
Just a little luck
To look like a millionaire bucks
Oooh, baby, baby
It kind of makes you think
That the stars were in sync on the night we met
There oughtta be a red carpet
Everywhere you go
Roll it on out
Hey don't you know that

[Repeat Chorus]

I knew right away from the very first kiss
That it doesn't get much better than this
We fit just like a favorite pair of jeans
We just keep coming back for more
Like two kids in a candy store
Now I know what everybody means
When they say

[Repeat Chorus]
