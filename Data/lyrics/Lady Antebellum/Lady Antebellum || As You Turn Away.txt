Standing face to face
Wrapped in your embrace
I don't wanna let you go
But you're already gone

Now you kiss my cheek
Soft and bittersweet
I can read it in your eyes
Baby, this is our goodbye

Nothing more to say
Nothing left to break
I keep reaching out for you
Hoping you might stay

Nothing more to give
Nothing left to take
I keep reaching out for you
Reaching out for you
As you turn away

Let go of my hand
So I can feel again
Nothing's gonna hurt as much
As that final touch

No we can't be friends
Cause I don't think I could take seeing you
And knowing where we've been
I hope you understand

Nothing more to say
Nothing left to break
I keep reaching out for you
Hoping you might stay

Nothing more to give
Nothing left to take
I keep reaching out for you
Reaching out for you
As you turn away

One step my heart is breaking
One more my hands are shaking
The door is closing
And I just can't change it

Nothing more to say
Nothing left to break

Nothing more to give
Nothing left to take
I keep reaching out for you
Reaching out for you
I keep reaching out for you
Reaching out for you
As you turn away,
As you turn away,
As you turn away...
