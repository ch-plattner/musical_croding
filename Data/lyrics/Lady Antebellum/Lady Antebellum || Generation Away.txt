
If I was a summer, I wanna be '69
I'd be chilling, listening to Dylan, holding up a peace sign.
And if I was a prison, I wanna be Folsom
Johnny Cash be rocking that black,
Singing to the stripes and kicking out all the lights.

Hey, what can I say?
I hope they'd talk about us that way
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right here making history.
Hey, what can we do?
Here we are, it's me and you
So let's take all the pictures we can take
For the generation away

Come on!

If I was an old car, I wanna be a Mustang
American made with a white rag top on a blue sky kind of day.
And if I was a preacher, I wanna be Dr. King
Oh, I know he's up there smiling down cause we all still have a dream.

Hey, what can I say?
I hope they'd talk about us that way
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right here making history.
Hey, what can we do?
Here we are, it's me and you
So let's take all the pictures we can take
For the generation away

Let's make some memories while we can
Laugh and love, don't miss your chance
Cause he still got the whole world in his hands
So baby let's dance
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Yeah I'm singing
Hey, what can I say?
I hope they talk about us that way
Raise your voice and have no fear
Let 'em know that you were here.
Singing
Hey, what can we do?
Here we are, it's me and you
So let's take all the pictures we can take
And let's make all the memories we can make
For the generation away

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole wide world right in his hands
So come on now, everybody just dance
He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole wide world right in his hands
So sing out loud and wave your hands
Got the whole word
Got the whole wide world
The whole wide world, oh yeah
Now everybody in the party,
Everybody in the place
Come on and put your hands up
Come on and put your hands up
Oh no, oh oh, yeah
