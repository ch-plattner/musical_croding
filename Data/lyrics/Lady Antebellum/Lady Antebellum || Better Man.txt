The first time I laid eyes on you
In that downtown caf√©
How I loved the way your auburn hair
Danced across your face
And looking back at who I was
I don't recognize that guy
Oh I can't imagine where I'd be
Without you by my side

I'm a better man since I love you
I'm a better man since I love you
When this crazy world is all through
I'll be a better man cause I love you
Cause I love you

Sometimes I find it hard to keep
Both feet on the ground
Yeah but everything worth fighting for
Is worth the ups and downs
It's amazing how we got
To where are from where we've been
Yeah it's funny how through it all
We're still the best of friends

I'm a better man since I love you
I'm a better man since I love you
When this crazy world is all through
I'll be a better man cause I love you
Oh, cause I love you

Oh, I love you

Do you remember that one night
We spent in Santa Fe
We drank ourselves into a fight
And almost threw it all away
We talked it out till the bar closed down
And we gave it one more try
As they swept the floors, we just sat there
Laughing till we cried

I'm a better man since I love you
I'm a better man since I love you
And if this crazy world should come unglued
I'll be a better man cause I love you
Oh, I'm a better man
You know that's true
Cause I love you
Oh, yes I do
Baby I love you, oh whoa, I do
I do, I do, I do.
