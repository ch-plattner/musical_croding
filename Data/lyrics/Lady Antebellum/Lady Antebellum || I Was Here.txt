
You will notice me
I'll be leaving my mark like initials carved in an old oak tree
You wait and see
Maybe I'll write like Twain wrote
Maybe I'll paint like Van Gogh
Cure the common cold
I don't know but I'm ready start cause I know in my heart

I wanna do something that matters
Say something different
Something that sets the whole world on its ear
I wanna do something better
With the time I've been given
And I wanna try
To touch a few hearts in this life
Leave nothing less
Than something that says "I was here"

I will prove you wrong
If you think I'm all talk, you're in for a shock
Cause this dream's too strong
And before too long

Maybe I'll compose symphonies,
Maybe I'll fight for world peace
Cause I know it's my destiny
To leave more than a trace of myself in this place

I wanna do something that matters
Say something different
Something that sets the whole world on its ear
I wanna do something better
With the time I've been given
And I wanna try
To touch a few hearts in this life
Leave nothing less
Than something that says "I was here"

And I know that I will do more than just pass through this life
I'll leave nothing less than something that says "I was here"

"I was here"
(I was here)
"I was here"
(wanna do something that matters)
(Something that says I was here)
"wanna do something that matters"
(Something that says I was here)
"I was here"
