
There's a towel on the bathroom door
A t-shirt in my dresser if you like
And I'll go put the coffee on
I'll pour a cup for you if you've got the time

All these years we been nothing but friends
And even though we didn't plan on this

Can last night last
Or was it just too much red wine
Or one too many lonely nights
Can last night last
And could this be the start of us
Every morning waking up
To your sleepy eyes smiling back
Or is it just too soon to ask
Can last night last

I probably should be going now
Cause I'm not quite sure what to say
I'm so afraid you might get scared
If I told you how much I wanna stay

Here we are somewhere between lovers and friends
Is this the end, or where it begins

Can last night last
Or was it just too much red wine
Or one too many lonely nights
Can last night last
And could this be the start of us
Every morning waking up
