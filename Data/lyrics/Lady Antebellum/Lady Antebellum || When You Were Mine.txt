Words spoken, my heart open,
No I never had butterflies like that.
We danced in the moon glow,
Your hands moved slow,
You kissed me on the lips,
Swore I wouldn't look back.
It was just like we were flying, in another time,

I felt the world was ours for the taking,
When I fell into your eyes,
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried.
You promised you'd never break my heart,
Never leave me in the dark,
Said your love would be for all time,
But that was back when you were mine
When you were...

Here, with me, I thought we'd be,
Stronger than the past,
Better than the ones before.
How did I fool myself in thinking,
We had it all

I felt the world was ours for the taking,
When I fell into your eyes,
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried.
You promised you'd never break my heart,
Never leave me in the dark,
Said your love would be for all time,
But that was back when you were mine
When you were...

What if this was it baby
What if this was our time
Maybe we're long past saving,
I'm gonna give you one try,
You better think twice,
Before you leave her behind.

And what if the world was ours for the taking
When I fell into your eyes,
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried.
You promised you'd never break my heart,
Never leave me in the dark,
Said your love would be for all time,
But that was back when you were mine
When we were in love
Do you remember that time
When you were mine

Oooh
(That was back when you were mine)
What if this was it baby
What if this was our time
(Back when we were in love)
Back when you were mine
(That was back when you were mine)
Back when we were in love,
In love

You said you'd be there,
You'd said it'd last forever,
I guess you've never really meant it baby
Did you baby?
