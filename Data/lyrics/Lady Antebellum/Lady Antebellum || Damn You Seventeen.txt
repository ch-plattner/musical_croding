
I still smell the smoke
I still taste the Crown
I still feel the vinyl of the backseat
With the windows halfway down

Yeah I still hear "Pour Some Sugar On Me" in the tape deck
With both of us singin' along
And I still hear me sayin' "Baby not yet, not yet"
Talk about a memory
Damn girl you put a few on me, on me

[Chorus:]
Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
My heart's still stuck at a stop light with you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green, yeah it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen

I still smell your hair
I still taste the salt
Mixed with the cherry on your lips
Afraid your mama might come home
I still see all your vintage rock n' roll t-shirts
Hangin' on your closet door
Back when we really didn't know what we were, we were
Talk about a heartache
I'm still wearin' out the replay, the replay

[Chorus:]
Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
My heart's still stuck at a stop light with you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green, yeah it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen

I wanna call
But I bet your number's changed a couple times
Couple towns ago but I can't let you go

[Chorus:]
Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stop light with you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green, no it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen
Oh
Damn you seventeen
My heart's still stuck at a stop light with you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
And I wanna call ya, oooh oh
Damn you seventeen
