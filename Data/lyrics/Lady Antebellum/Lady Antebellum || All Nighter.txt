
I'ma walking out of my front door
I'ma jumping in my car
Take another left on Main Street
Head right to where you are
I'm rolling down my window
I'ma turn the radio on
Find a little spot to let go
Get a little good time gone

'Cause this is an all nighter
I get lost lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
It's not in our hands, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter

We were gonna take that sunset
Make it turn the blue sky red
We can worry about tomorrow
Or watch her silly lips instead 
Get a little back road busy
Let the moon shine on us
Get a little lovedrunk dizzy
'Til the sun stings back up
'Cause we just can't get enough

'Cause this is an all nighter
I get lost lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
It's not in our hands, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter, oh yeah
Baby, oh oh oh

Time it can't kills, trouble can't cools
Take another sip, talking 'til two

'Cause this is an all nighter
I get lost lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
It's not in our hands, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter

We're taking the night, that's alright
We're gonna outshine the moonlight
This is, this is, this is an all nighter

We're taking the night, that's alright
We're gonna outshine the moonlight
This is, this is, this is

I'm walking out my front door
I'ma jumping in my car
