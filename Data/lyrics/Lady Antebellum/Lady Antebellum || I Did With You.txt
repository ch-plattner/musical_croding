
I remember thinking 'bout forever
Sitting there with you by the river
We danced in the headlights
And fell for the first time

I remember telling you I loved you
The Northern star rising above you
And in that moment I thought every dream would come true
Oh, but some just never do

Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking,
Not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you.
Oh, I did, I did with you.

Through the years I just kept on believing
Had to be a plan or a reason
But Heaven was silent and life just kept moving along
'Til my heart knew the moment was gone

Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking,
Not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you

Love is the reason why
Miracles never die
They just live on and on
Like a song, like a song
In the hearts of the ones you leave behind

Ooh, yeah

Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking,
Not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you.
Oh, I did, yeah, I did with you.
