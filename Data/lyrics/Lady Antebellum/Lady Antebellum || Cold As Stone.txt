
She left town early on a Friday
Headin' down to family in New Orleans
Said she needed to feel the sun on her face,
Talk it out with herself,
Try to get things straight.
Lord all I know is I don't wanna breathe.

I wish I was cold as stone,
Then I wouldn't feel a thing.
I wish I didn't have this heart,
Then I wouldn't know the sting of the rain.
I could stand strong and still,
Watching you walk away.
I wouldn't hurt like this,
Or feel so all alone.
I wish I was cold as stone.

Almost turned around in Mississippi,
Pulled over on the shoulder along the way.
Thought by now, I'd be fine
But all these tears are blurring every line.
And I think back to when you were mine.

I wish I was cold as stone,
Then I wouldn't feel a thing.
I wish I didn't have this heart,
Then I wouldn't know the sting of the rain.
I could stand on my own
Letting your memory fade
I wouldn't hurt like this,
Or feel so all alone.
I wish I was cold as stone.

Yeah, it's gonna take forever to get over you.
Oh, and I don't think this pain's gonna go away.
Oh, scars left when it's said and done remain.

I wish I was cold as stone.
I wish I was cold as stone.

I wish I was cold as stone,
Then I wouldn't feel a thing.
I wish I didn't have this heart,
Then I wouldn't know the sting of the rain.
I could stand strong and still,
Watching you walk away.
I wouldn't hurt like this,
Or feel so all alone.
I wish I was cold as stone.
I wish I was cold as stone.
