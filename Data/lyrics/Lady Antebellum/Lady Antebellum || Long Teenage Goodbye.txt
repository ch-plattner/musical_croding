It was the start of the summer and the days were getting hotter, yeah
18 was just around the corner
And mamma made plans for a party by the pool side
I blew out the candles, smiling and laughing
Sister sneaking wine while the camera was flashing
You grabbed my hand right on time
You looked so cute with your tattoo and your blue jeans
And you said to me

Let's go flying
Take me anywhere the wind blows
No use crying, we're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
We drug out those summer nights
For a long teenage goodbye

Chasing fireworks flashing down the Carolina shore, yeah
Arms around me and you called me yours
That salty kiss made me forget about my sunburn
Snuck in barefoot through a hole the wall
Got to do some karaoke till they yell last call
Sing with the birds, every season has a turn, turn, turn

So let's go flying
Take me anywhere the wind blows
No use crying, we're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
We drug out those summer nights
For a long teenage goodbye

A chill in the air's just around the bend
You said we're never gonna get this time back again
Back again

So let's go flying
Take me anywhere the wind blows
No use crying, we're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
We drug out those summer nights
For a long teenage goodbye
For a long teenage goodbye
