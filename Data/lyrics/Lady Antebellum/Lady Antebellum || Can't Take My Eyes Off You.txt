
I know that the bridges that I've burned
Along the way
Have left me with these walls and these scars
That won't go away
And opening up has always been the hardest thing
Until you came

[Chorus:]
So lay here beside me, just hold me and don't let go
This feelin' I'm feelin' is somethin' I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you

I love when you tell me that I'm pretty
[Album version:] When I just wake up
[Acoustic version:] When I just woke up
And I love how you tease me when I'm moody
[Album version:] But it's never too much
[Acoustic version:] And it's always enough
[Album version:] I'm falling fast but the truth is I'm not scared at all
[Acoustic version:] I'm falling fast and the truth is I'm not scared at all
[Album version:] You're climbin' my walls
[Acoustic version:] You broke my walls

[Chorus]

Off you
Off you

So lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go
Oh, this feelin' I'm feelin' is somethin' I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you
