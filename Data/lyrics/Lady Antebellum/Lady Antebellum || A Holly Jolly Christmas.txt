Have a holly jolly Christmas
It’s the best time of the year
I don’t know if there’ll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn’t hear
Uh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year

Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn’t hear
Uh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year

Santa Claus is coming to town
