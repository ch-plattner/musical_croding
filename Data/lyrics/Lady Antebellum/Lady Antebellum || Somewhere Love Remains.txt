Here we go again
Sitting on the edge of leaving
You don’t have to speak
I can see it in your eyes
I know you too well
You know I can tell you’re hiding
Something inside

Baby just breathe in, breathe out
Before you turn around, just slow down
Think of all the love we’ve made
If we give it just one more try
Maybe we could stop this goodbye
I know through all this pain
Somehow somewhere love remains

You say don’t walk away
But baby give me one good reason
More than just a line
You better make it count this time
You told me but you never really showed me
That I’m worth the fight
Oh I’m worth the fight

Baby just breathe in, breathe out
Before you turn around, just slow down
Think of all the love we’ve made
If we give it just one more try
Maybe we could stop this goodbye
I know through all this pain
Somehow somewhere love remains

Love takes time to build its defenses
And trust takes time to tear down those fences
And what remains is stronger than ever before
So don’t walk out that door
I don’t wanna hurt anymore

So baby just breathe in, breathe out
The only time for love is right now
Forgive all of the mistakes we’ve made
If we give it just one more try
Maybe we could stop this goodbye
Through the fire and rain
Somehow somewhere
I know through all this pain
Somehow somewhere love remains

So baby just breathe in, breathe out

I never wanted to give up this fight
What if we give it baby one more try?
Let’s try, this time
Baby this time
Baby this time
Baby this time
