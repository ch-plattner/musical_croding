
The storms of life are gonna blow through, baby
You know we've all seen a cloud or two
But I meant it when I promised I would have your back through sky black or blue.
Do you remember how we swore forever till the sweet or the bitter end
Well, this is what they mean when they say you got the real thing in a friend.

With arms open wide
I'll be your umbrella when you just can't stand the rain
I'm there by your side,
I wanna be your shelter when you just can't stand
When you just can't stand the rain

I don't know where the road you're on is gonna end up
Or what this crazy world will put you through.
But don't you worry about me, baby
You just go and do what you gotta do.
I'll still be here for you

With arms open wide
I'll be your umbrella when you just can't stand the rain
I'm there by your side,
I wanna be your shelter when you just can't stand
When you just can't stand the rain

When you can't take it even one more day
No, I'm never too far away
Even when you feel like you're out there on your own,
No you're not alone, no
Oh, no

With arms open wide
I'll be your umbrella when you just can't stand the rain
I'm there by your side,
I wanna be your shelter when you just can't stand
When you just can't stand the rain
Oh yeah
When you just can't stand the rain
When you just can't stand the rain
