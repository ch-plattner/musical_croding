Love, something you know nothing of
Cause love don't turn and run
And leave you standing in the dark.
You, tell me that your feelings changed
And you don't wanna stay and break my heart
Well baby it's too late.

Cause what about the times that you said to me
That I was everything that you'd ever need
How come you just up and walk away
And look me in the eye and say

You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love

Love, what was I supposed to do?
Falling out can be so cruel
But I just can't ignore the truth.
So, don't tell me I don't understand
Cause I don't want this on my hands
But it's all that's left to do.

Everything you want's what we used to be
And I can't fight these feelings inside of me
As much as this hurts, it's the only way
Believe me when I say

I did it all for love
I did it all for love
I did it all for love
I did it all for love

Love, something you know nothing of
Cause if you did, there's still be an us
I did it all for love.
