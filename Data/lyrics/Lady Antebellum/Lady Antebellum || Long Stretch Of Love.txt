
You're hit then miss
You're fire and ice
You're water and whisky burn
We kiss we fight
Make up all night
You're the blessing and the curse
But I don't ever wanna break this chain
I don't ever wanna walk away
Cause I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Make me feel this way
Over and over and over we say that we're through
But I come right back to you

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
I'm your rock that won't ever roll
And baby you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you
If these good times get tough
Baby we're in for a long stretch of love

You lift me up
You bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose we'll never change

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
I'm your rock that won't ever roll
And baby you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you
If these good times get tough
Baby we're in for a long stretch of love

Oh, long stretch of love
Oh, long stretch of love
Oh, long stretch of love

Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose we'll never change

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
I'm your rock that won't ever roll
And baby you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you
If these good times get tough
Baby we're in for a long stretch of love

Oh, long stretch of love
Oh, long stretch of love
Oh, long stretch of love

Oh, baby
I don't ever wanna break this chain
I don't ever wanna walk away

Oh, long stretch of love
