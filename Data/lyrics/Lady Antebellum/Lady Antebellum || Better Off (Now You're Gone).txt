I threw away a lifetime, you laughed and called it a sin
There ain't ever gonna be a way to work it out, not after a night like this
I've been waiting on your call now just the silence and me
I know you want me to chase you around but I'm so tired of asking you please

I'm through with this, I'll forget your kiss and move on
There'll be no sleepless nights, I'll be alright from now on
I'm better off now that you're gone
I'm better off now that you're gone

You put me so far down girl, I couldn't even stand on my own
Ghosts of you would come back to me whenever I was alone
Now the candles have all burned out and the doors are locked and chained
Have no doubts this time I've figured out a way to end all your games

I'm through with this, I'll forget your kiss and move on
There'll be no sleepless nights, I'll be alright from now on
I'm better off now that you're gone
I'm better off now that you're gone

Nights filled with empty bottles and picking up broken glass
I should have known from the very first night, that this just would never last

Oh, I'm through with this, I'll forget your kiss and move on
There'll be no sleepless nights, I'll be alright from now on
I'm better off now that you're gone
I'm better off now that you're gone
So much better off now that you're gone
