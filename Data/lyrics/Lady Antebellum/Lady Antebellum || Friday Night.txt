
I don't wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Of things you gotta do and places that you gotta go
Oh no

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night

We can rock together, let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup make a memory, drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you
'Neath the blue sky fallin' in love

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night

I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket cause you just got paid babe

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night

Wanna be your Friday night
Friday night
