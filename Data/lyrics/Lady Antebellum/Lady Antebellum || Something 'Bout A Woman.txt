with my t-shirt on
hair in her eyes, no make-up on
standin there smilin with my coffee cup
yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman that's easy to love

Yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman 
that's a clear blue sky
Ain't found nothin better that'll get you high
You're the colors of the sun at the end of the day
Yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman that makes you feel that way 

She's like fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pourin' down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's somethin 'bout a woman and me

Yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman 
when she gets fixed up
Slips a red dress on and her eyes light up
I love to watch her walkin from across the room
Yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman 
and the way she moves me
she moves me
oh, she moves me

She's like fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pourin' down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's somethin 'bout a woman and me

She moves me
she moves me
oh, she moves me
She's like fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pourin' down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's somethin 'bout a woman and me

Yeah there's somethin 'bout a woman that makes me still
There's somethin 'bout a woman that always will
