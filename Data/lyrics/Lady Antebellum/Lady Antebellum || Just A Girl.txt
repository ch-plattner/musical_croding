
Boy you must of come up short tonight
Cause I'm always your consolation prize
Usually I'd fix my hair put on my coat
And show up at your door
But no more

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm
Just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no past time
This is gonna be the last time I'm just a call
When there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall
In a pretty dress and curls
To you I'm just a girl
To you I'm just a girl

I was always taught to sit up straight
Find a man before it gets too late
Give him time to make his mind
But I can't be the one you string along
Like some old sad song

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm
Just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no past time
This is gonna be the last time I'm just a call
When there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall
In a pretty dress and curls
To you I'm just a girl
To you I'm just a girl
To you I'm just a girl

Talking through the static
Just a girl
To you I'm just dramatic
Just a girl
Just a silly little thing
And that's all you've ever seen
There's so much more to me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm
Just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no past time
This is gonna be the last

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm
Just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no past time
This is gonna be the last time I'm just a call
When there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall
In a pretty dress and curls
To you I'm just a girl
To you I'm just a girl

You don't care what I think
To you I'm just a girl
You only call when you drink
To you I'm just a girl
