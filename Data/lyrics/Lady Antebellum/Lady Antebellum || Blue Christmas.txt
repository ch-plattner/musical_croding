
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red 
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me

And when the blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas

Oh no no no

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red 
On a green Christmas tree
Well it won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas

Baby I'll have a blue blue Christmas
Oh so very blue
