I was born I was blessed
Right place, right time I guess
Ain't no good reason why I left
Except to run and roam
Would you take me back and take me in
Let me be your child again
Kiss my cheek forgive my sins
And let me call you home
Oh I may stay here for a while

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly I'm gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South

Religion and me don't always agree
But I sure love my maker
It sounds just like a gospel song
When I sing my little prayer
Got rocks in my shoes
Holes in my soul
I'm covered in dirt from head to toe
From walking along this winding road
That brought me back to here
Oh I may stay here for a while

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly I'm gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Na na na na na na na
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Na na na na na na na

Oh I may stay here for a while

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly I'm gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South
Down South

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Na na na na na na na
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Na na na na na

Down South
Born and raised
Down South
Where I learned to pray
Down South is where I'll stay
Down South
Down South
Born and raised
Down South
Where I learned to pray
Down South is where I'll stay
Down South
Down South
Rocks in my shoes
Holes in my soul
I'm covered in dirt from head to toe
