
I know the road you know ain't quite the way you planned it
But the twists and turns are all part of the magic
And believe me you'll get through it
You'll see

So don't be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you can't try to lead or control it
'Cause that's just life as we know it

Well I don't know much but in life there's all these reasons
And beauty lies in the young child, that's believing
You know love is all we feel and need
To breathe

So don't be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you can't try to lead or control it
'Cause that's just life as we know it

Oh it will pass you by so fast
So don't let it go
'Cause only love will last
Long after you're gone

So don't be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you can't try to lead or control it
'Cause that's just life as we know it

Life as we know it
Life as we know it
