
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night (Lord of my life) holy night (I sing to You)
Shepherds quake (be with us now) at the sight (on this Christmas night)
Glories stream from heaven afar (let all be calm)
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia (and hearts be light)
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

Silent night (oh what a night) holy night (praising Your birth)
Son of God (light of my heart) love's pure light (shine down Your grace)
Radiant beams from Thy holy face (to save the world)
With the dawn of redeeming grace (to You we praise)
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Silent night, holy night
