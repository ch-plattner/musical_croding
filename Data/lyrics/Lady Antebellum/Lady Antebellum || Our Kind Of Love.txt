Here we go!

You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon

I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say
That's right, oh that's right
What we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mm that's our kind of love

Skipping rocks and leaving footprints
Down along the riverbank
Always holding hands, never making plans
Just living in the moment, babe

> You get me laughing with those funny faces
You somehow always know just what to say
That's right, oh that's right
What we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
That's our kind of love

Oh that's right, baby you and I
What we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, oh
Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love

Oo, that's our kind of love
Oh, that's our kind of love

1,2,3, here we go!
Oo, yeah
That's our kind of love, girl
Dontcha know it
