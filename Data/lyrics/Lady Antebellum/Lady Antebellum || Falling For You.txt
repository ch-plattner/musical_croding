
I hear my heart like the beat of a drum.
You take me up to a high I've never known.
There ain't no way we can slow this down.
This train's too fast to ever turn it back around.

I don't wanna think too much.
Let me get lost in your soul.
Wanna feel that freedom lettin' go.

So hold me now.
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'.
Just lay me down and steal my heart tonight.
There's fire in your eyes.
There's magic in your touch.
I still want you to stay.
But it feels like us so.
Hold me now, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' for you.

You kiss my lips.
I can feel that spark.
And that's all it takes.
Shadows dancin' in the dark.

I don't wanna think too much.
Let's follow where it leads.
Just as long as you're right next to me.

So hold me now.
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'.
Just lay me down and steal my heart tonight.
There's fire in your eyes.
There's magic in your touch.
I still want you to stay.
But it feels like us so.
Hold me now, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' for you.

Fallin' for you fast.
Somethin' like a dream.
I want you so bad it's hard to even breathe.

So hold me now.
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'.
Just lay me down and steal my heart tonight.
There's fire in your eyes.
There's magic in your touch.
I still want you to stay.
But it feels like us so.
Hold me now, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' for you.

Fallin' for you.
I'm fallin'.
I'm fallin' for you.
Ooo oo oo oo
