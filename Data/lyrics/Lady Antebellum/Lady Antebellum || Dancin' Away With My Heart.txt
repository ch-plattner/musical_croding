
I finally asked you to dance
On the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over

[Chorus:]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me you'll always be 18
And beautiful and dancin' away with my heart

I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean into kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me

[Chorus]

You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much

[Chorus]

Nah nah nah [x3]

Away with My Heart

Nah nah nah [x3]
