
Went walking through town just the other day
with nothin much to do.
As the sun came breakin down through the clouds 
I never seen the sky so blue
I saw a cajun man with a red guitar singing on the side of the street
I threw a handful of change in his beat up case and said play me a country beat
And it sounded like....

Met up with some friends outside of town
we were headed towards the lake
I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep and felt the wind upon my face
We got to the spot and the sun was hot, everybody was feelin fine. 
So we jumped on in for a midday swim and then we lost all track of time. 

It was the perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin in a perfect day.

As the moon came out and the fire burned 
everybody was singin along
To some Ramblin' Man a little Curtis Loew and all them feel good songs
We danced all night without a care, no place we'd rather be
Cause these are the days we'll talk about, when we lived so wild and free

It was the perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin in a perfect day.

We were sittin in the sand as he grabbed my hand
And then leaned in for a kiss
I couldn't help but think with the stars above it don't get much better than this

It was the perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin, feels like dreamin', slowly drifting, through this perfect day.
