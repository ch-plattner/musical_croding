This winter's night
Stars shine like silver bells
This winter's night
The mistletoe kiss and tell
Snowflakes fall like frosting
And I sit on the street
Strangers look like neighbors
With every smile that you meet

But here in my arms I'll keep you warm 
And hold you tight
On this winter's night
(We'll look back on the year) 
On this winter's night
(We'll count our blessings)
On this Winter's night
We will remember

This winter's night
Icicle lights will trim the tree
This winter's night
Wrapped a present or two from you and me
Tuck our children into bed 
And dream the night away
Til' the sun dawns in the mornin
With the joy of Christmas day

But here in my arms I'll keep you warm 
And hold you tight
On this winter's night
(We'll look back on the year) 
On this winter's night
(We'll count our blessings)
On this Winter's night
We will remember

The wisemen heard the angels sing 
And Him like soft and robe
The king became a child a long long time ago
And the child became a king 
So the whole wide world will know
What christmas really is
