The night is hot,
Got a full moon rising
And you know this is the time I get a little bit lonely
And I can't fight it, I can't hide it.
Don't know where you are,
But I want you just like lightning
Shooting straight out of the sky,
Come and strike me with your light igniting
Yeah, igniting.

Gotta get to me, gotta get to me
You gotta spread your wings and start flying.
Like a drop of rain, gotta find the way
Don't hit the brakes, just come and crash through my horizon.
Bring back the air, I need to breathe, baby
You gotta get to me.

The bottle is empty
And I'm dancing in the shadow of a memory.
Yeah, call me crazy
But I still got this schoolgirl's dream.
You're gonna show up and kiss me,
Pull me in, hold me tight, love me and carry me away
Like there's no more tomorrows and no more yesterdays.

Gotta get to me, gotta get to me
You gotta spread your wings and start flying.
Like a drop of rain, gotta find the way
Don't hit the brakes, just come and crash through my horizon.
Bring back the air, I need to breathe, baby
You gotta get to me.

Gotta get to me, gotta get to me
You gotta spread your wings and start flying.
Like a drop of rain, gotta find the way
Don't hit the brakes, just come and crash through my horizon.
Bring back the air, I need to breathe, baby
And get to me.
Get to me, get to me, yeah
You gotta get to me.

The night is hot,
Got a full moon rising...
