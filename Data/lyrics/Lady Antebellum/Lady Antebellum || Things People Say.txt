
There I was at the bus stop beggin' you just to stay
Can we work this out, baby we can work this out
A dust trail from a Greyhound headed for the West Coast
As I watch you leave, it's gettin' hard to breathe
No this ain't how it was suppose to be
While you're out chasin' all your dreams
Tell me where does that leave me

[Chorus]
What about the plans that you left behind
The little white house by the railway line
The one we picked out
We even put the payment down
What about the promise that you made
To stay with me till your dying day
Said you'd never go away
Are they just things that people say

The preacher stopped by the house last Tuesday
Asked if I was fine
We sat and talked a while
He tried to make me smile
But it's so hard to show my face round lately
In this small town
I guess they heard the news
'Bout me and you
It's three a.m. and I can't sleep at all
I wonder where you are tonight and do I ever cross your mind

[Repeat Chorus]

Well my momma won't stop crying
She wonders what went wrong
Could I have loved a little deeper
Or did I hold on too strong

[Repeat Chorus]
