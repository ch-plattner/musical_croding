Oh the snow’s coming down
I’m watching it fall
Lots of people all around
Baby please come home

(Christmas)
And the church bells in town
(Christmas)
Are singing in song
(Christmas)
For the happy sound
Baby please come home

They’re singing “Deck the Halls”
But it’s not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
To the lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I’m watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

They’re singing “Deck the Halls”
But it’s not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
All that they worked will be heed
(Christmas)
I wrote back this to you
(Christmas)
But it’s Christmas babe
So please, please
Baby, please
Baby please come home

(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
No, it don’t, don’t feel like Christmas at all

(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
Ah baby
Ah baby please come home

(Christmas)
(Christmas)
(Christmas)
No, it don’t, don’t feel like Christmas at all

(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
Oh woh
(Christmas)
Ah baby
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Please come home
