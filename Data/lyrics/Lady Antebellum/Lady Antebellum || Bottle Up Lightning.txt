Look me up when you're back in town
You know the number I'll be around
Doing what I do
Been living my life as a simple man
And being alright with where i am
But when it come to you

I wish I would've taken a few more chances
spun you 'round the room a few more dances
Just for once look past these fences
Followed your heart over that horizon
Never looking back just keep on driving
But holding you is just like trying 
To bottle up lightning

There's one little voice on the inside,
That's dying to tell you don't say goodbye
But I can't make you stay
You might stay a day or a couple weeks
But sooner or later you'll find your wings
And you'll just fly away
And you'll hear me say,

I wish I would've taken a few more chances
spun you 'round the room a few more dances
Just for once look past these fences
Followed your heart over that horizon
Never looking back just keep on driving
But holding you is just like trying
To bottle up lightning

I wish I would've taken a few more chances
spun you 'round the room a few more dances
Just for once look past these fences
Followed your heart over that horizon
Never looking back just keep on driving
But holding you is just like trying
To bottle up lightning
To bottle up lightning
