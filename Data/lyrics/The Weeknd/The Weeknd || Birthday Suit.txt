[Verse 1:]
Here's a special cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Watch me throw it in the air
Pocket full of 1's with the zeros in a pair
Find myself staring at your waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist
On my superman shit, X ray vision while you shaking those tits

[Hook:]
I just wanna see you in your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin girl, before we begin

[Verse 2:]
Baby it's your special day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day
You already know paddle in a boat while I make your river float
Baby you gonna make me take a break
Oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe
Back at it again, money ain't a thang, baby I made it this way
So just get

[Hook:]
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin

[Verse 3:]
Girl take off your outfit, call my place a dressing room
I be on that pussy but before my mind's undressing you
My stride Martin Luther with the brain like Luther
Kryptonite in my pants go ahead go super
Ya man do you wrong, like he printed out a typo
Your body so crack should be whiter than albino
Your body so crack got me horny like a rhino
Shit, I know you seen wood like pine glow
Trust me when I say I keep you sacred like chi lo
Trust me when I say I satisfy you till the night go
Girl you already know the best damn part is
Get you on your back, wax you like Kelly Clarkson
Officers bad girl, you're so wanted
To be honest, I have a rocket in my pocket
Won't you want it baby, I just want you on it, babe, oh whoa

[Hook:]
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don't wanna see you baby in those clothes
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissing on your skin, girl before we begin, ehe, oho, ehe, oho
In your birthday suit, birthday suit, whoa, whoa
