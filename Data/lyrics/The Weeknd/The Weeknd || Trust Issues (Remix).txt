All she cares about is money and the city where she’s from
Her intention is on paper, she don’t need no fucking love
She’s spillin’ all this liquor tryna pass me all these cups
Well baby girl I’m zonin’ somebody should have told her
I popped one
Fuck it I popped one
Oh girl I’m on one
Fuck it I popped one
I popped one

Girl I’m lying, I’m on a few
Don’t you worry this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot? I'm on eviction number two
'Cause I popped one

Fuck it I popped one
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Trust issues

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

Do you know what's going on over here (I do, I do, I do)
Have you even bothered to look? (I did, oh, I did)
Well if you know, then let me know
We don’t have to keep runnin’ in these circles (in these circles)
No more
