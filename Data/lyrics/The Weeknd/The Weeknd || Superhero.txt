
One to get loose, two for the honey
Three with the boobs, four cause it money
How many shots does it take to start the game
I can tell by your drink (drink)
You had a long day (day)
Let me break the ice girl what’s your name
And can I take all your worried stress away (ooh, ooh)

Do you always seem to fight cause I (can tell)
Don't shed no tears and I (can help)
Help you through your misery, hospitality that you need from me
And girl, I can hear the pain inside (your voice)
Argue every night but that's a choice and I can take it all away

Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be you superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your dark (ness)
I can be you superhero

Baby can’t you feel it
My power and those spirits and miracles are my speciality ooh
Girl, straight from a comic book and just one look
I can tell
Don't need X-Rays to see, that you're with me

Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be you superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your dark (ness)
I can be you superhero
