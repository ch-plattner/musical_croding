[Verse 1 - The Weeknd:]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young God
That pussy kill be so vicious
My God white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

[Hook - The Weeknd:]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 2 - Schoolboy Q:]
Often, often, girl I do this often
In that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune
Awesome, 100 plus, can't this from the auction
Need a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking
Show that pussy, work that pussy
Who that pussy, that's my pussy
Wet that pussy, stroke that pussy
Ooh! I twist the weed
You on your phone texting your friend to come fuck
I wonder if it's the druggies with hoes or the millions of bucks
But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]
Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'

[Hook]
