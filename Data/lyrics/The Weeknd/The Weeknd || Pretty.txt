Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa oh oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope, he made you satisfied
Well baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple man
I try to master the art, of that far away love
Only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been living in a cold, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
And he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

Quand une putain de colombe chante sa chanson,
C'est tout ce qu'on entend.
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que ne rien d'autre compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde.
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans
