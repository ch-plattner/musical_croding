
Shots of the Henny
Bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face
You don’t wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes
Cabbed all day
Took the bus back home
Evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed
Blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night lights
Lights passin’ you
Yeah
Just don’t blame it on me
That you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me
Cuz’ I get it
You’re built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin’
Specially when ya nose red
From the K special diet coke
You need more bread
‎Now you got no rent
You blow that money money
You try to window shop
You blow another hundred
Shes fuckin’ gone till the day
Have some nights down town
And ya’ daddy don’t know you’re out

If they don’t let you in
You know where to find me
Cus if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up ya’ mind you can find the love
Girl you ain’t alone
We all been in the love
Baby just be honest

And Woooaaahhh

I love it when your eyes are red
Ahhh Yeaa
Are you on my cloud yet?
Cus’ I got a brand new cam
Can we video feed
Can we POV
Ohhhh Ohh
I wanna catch you at your best
Ohhhh
When your hairs a mess
You look so depressed
And your filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home
Ohhhh

Cus these nights pass
So much quicker then the days did
Same clothes you ain’t ready for ya’ day shift
But your up you need money for ya’ face lift
Lust over love
Is your mindset
Waken up with most of ya’ side wet
Another roomy hear ya mom cryin’
Cus’ she found ya bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they won’t let you in
You know where to find me
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up ya’ mind you can find the love
Girl you ain’t alone
We all been in the love
Baby just be honest

I need, I need something from you
Oh, there’s so much love to pass around
There’s too much love
Girl, the night’s almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn’t long ago
Didn’t think I’d go this far
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There’s just something that I
Need for you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Just ride it
