[Verse 1]
She pop that pussy on a Monday
She never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she put in work
She wanna give me all her money
She used to spend it all alone 'cuz her man went and did her wrong, so she...
But baby I'm not trying to be the one
I got my baby waiting home
She been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart
And you can't pay to win my love
So keep dancin, baby, keep dancin, dancin
Keep dancin, dancin, keep dancin...

[Female whisper:] I want you

I know, yes [4X] I know...

[Female whisper:] Baby I want you

I'm too far in this game, so let go
So let go [2X]

[Female whisper:] Baby I want you

Baby, who you tryna fool
Girl, I might be 21 but I got memories to prove
That I've seen your kind before
And I know exactly what you want...

You just want me 'cuz I'm next
You just want me 'cuz I'm next, baby

[Verse 2]
Baby, who you callin' soft?
Don't make me smoke up all your kush
Don't make me pop your cheap ass pills
I used to do this for the thrill, Ooh yea
I know you got a lot to lose
But ain't nobody here but me
So baby what you got to prove? Ooh yea
I see the way your body moves
On the pole, on the floor, you're alone
But there ain't nothing I can do
So keep dancin, baby, keep dancin, dancin
Keep dancin, dancin, keep dancin...

[Female whisper:] I want you

I know, yes [4X] I know...

[Female whisper:] Baby I want you

I'm too far in this game, so let go
So let go [2X]

[Female whisper:] Baby I want you

Baby, who you tryna fool
Girl, I might be 21 but I got memories to prove
That I've seen your kind before
And I know exactly what you want...

You just want me 'cuz I'm next
You just want me 'cuz I'm next, baby
You just want me 'cuz I'm next

[Humming]

Ooh yea, ooh yea, ooh yea
[2X]
