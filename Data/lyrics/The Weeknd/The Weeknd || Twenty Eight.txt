
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
'Cause I see you're here to stay
Should have known to pick my fate
Ooh

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(You know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhh Ohhh

Hey there lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About the way I got you screaming my name
Did you have to tell the world, ooh
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could've been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(You know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhh Ohhh

Baby if I knew you'd be living in my sheets
I wouldn't have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You say you don't belong
You keep saying there's no one
And there's nowhere to go, ooh
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(You know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhh Ohhh
(Oh baby)
Oohh

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(You know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohh Ohh
(Baby)
Oooh Ooh, yeah
