[Verse 1:]
There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back
You've been here before
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

[Hook:]
We'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream

[Verse 2:]
There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

[Hook 2:]
We'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I'll teach you to dream, oooh
We'll find our love in the sky [x6]

[Verse 3:]
How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I've been flying around the world
I've been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence is low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Two or three times in a row
But I'm sure you would have left
Got that pussy in control
Put that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control, mmmmh
