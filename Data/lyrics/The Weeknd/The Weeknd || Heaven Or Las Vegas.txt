[Verse 1:]
I'm paying for all my father's sins
So I will thank him for you
I'm a thank him for you
My serotonin's got a while to go
Girl, it's gone cause of you
It's been gone cause of you

[Hook:]
They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I got heaven
Well I say, I am God

[Verse 2:]
I never prayed a moment in my life
Girl I'm rewarded with you
I've been rewarded with you
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh
Let me kiss it for you
I can kiss it for you

[Hook:]
They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I have heaven
I say, I am God
