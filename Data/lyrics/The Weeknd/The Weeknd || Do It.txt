I've been looking for this groove
You've have it, I need it
I can show you how to move
To stay with your feet up

[Bridge]
Baby girl we'll dance
Until the moon aborts the sky
Baby girl we'll dance
Until the sun kidnaps the night

[Chorus]
Baby girl you hold it
Love the way your moving
I just wanna see you freak
Boogie till the morning
Boogie till next evening
Baby I will set you free

Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)

Boogie till the sky is blue
The moon is our enemy
Slide until you burn your shoes
Or free fly so freely

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Got ya girl just do it like me
Baby girl do let me
Don't think about just move your feet
Baby girl move your feet
Rock it girl just do it like me
Baby girl do it like me
Don't think about it
Just move your feet
Baby girl move your feet

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
Do you want me to do it?
(what you wanna do)
