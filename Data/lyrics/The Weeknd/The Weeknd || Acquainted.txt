
Baby you're no good
'Cause they warned me bout your type girl
I've been ducking left and right
Baby you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted

Baby you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted

Momma caught me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real)
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me, shit
But ever since I met you
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe
(Woooooh)

I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted

I'm not trying to talk at all
'Cause I'm trying to love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'til you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
