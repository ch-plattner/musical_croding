I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to push me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night

You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you've been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don't you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you've been coming
I'll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won't stop until you ask me
Don't you worry 'bout us messing up my sheets

Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night
[x2]

You're gonna hate him
Then you'll want me
Then you'll miss him
Then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
(Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine
(Yes I know your routine)

You're gonna hate him
Then you'll want me
Then you'll miss him
Then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
(Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night
[x2]
