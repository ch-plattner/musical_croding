[Verse 1 - Ty Dolla $ign:]
She drive five hours for a nigga just to get some long dick
No flowers from her nigga out in Luxembourg
She came to Paris for a nigga
She want to introduce her parents to a nigga, shit
I just came from Milan, I had a threesome with two white bitches
Almost had a four but the black girl didn't even like bitches
I let her suck the dick, and passed her to my nigga
Bunch of bad bitches in Geneva
Twenty bottles in the club on my Visa
Smokin' like a Taylor at my table, uh
It's Pushaz Inc., the motherfuckin' label, and that XO
All my niggas on that dick, we sold ourselves to the devil
Local niggas say that, tell em to first get on my level
Out in Berg in the coupe slidin'
With a bitch, 'bout to get it poppin'

[Hook - The Weeknd:]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it [x4]
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2 - Belly:]
Dabbin' up, dabbin' up, I just hit the wax for breakfast
Bitches tryna leave quick so they can't find a exit
Chest feeling heavy like I sixty-nined with precious (wait)
Chest feeling heavy like I'm pourin' up in Texas
Told a bitch come over give me a perm, spit some G to ya
Don't you tell these hoes what you learn, this is free for ya
Kush got a triple action on some smokey shit
Long dick reach deep down, in fallopian
Half Brazilian her ass was Amazonian
Dab by the slab, got you feeling like it's opium
XO, bad hoes they call me Dablo Esco
Unless it's money me no hablo
Used to wish I could have you, now I wish you would leave
Got niggas payin' your rent, you keep a trick up your sleeve
Money hidden in the walls like it's insulation
Couple Asian bitches, call it an orientation

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - The Weeknd:]
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I'm attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that's a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'm a shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'm a break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
'Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'm a pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it's all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain't shit funny, can't nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of, all of
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
