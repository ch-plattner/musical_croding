[Wiz laugh]
I got a lotta cash
I don't mind spending it
[Wiz laugh again]

[Verse 1 — The Weeknd:]
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you dripping cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrappin 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, I had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death, I'm tryna make these bitches sweat
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet, I'm tryna fuck her and her friends

[Bridge — Ty Dolla $ign:]
You gonna run it for these hundreds, girl, or nah?
Show me is you really 'bout your money, girl, or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl, take it off
Take it for a real one
You gonna get it all

[Hook — Ty Dolla $ign:]
Is you really 'bout your money or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Or nah, or nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Or nah
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Or nah, or nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Or nah

[Verse 2 — Wiz Khalifa:]
I'm a smoke this joint then I'm a break you off
I be lying if I said you ain't the one
All these tattoos in my skin, they turn you on
Lotta smoking, drinking, that's the shit I'm on
Heard you not the type that you take home to Mom
Is we fucking when we leave the club or nah?
I ain't spending cash for nothing, I wanna see you take it off
I'm a pop this bottle, you gon' give me brain or nah?
Heard you from the hood, you rep that thing or nah?
Got a lotta ass, you gonna shake that thing or nah?
Heard you smoke blunts, you down with paper planes or nah?
I feel like I'm Tony, you my boss? I'm thinking nah
The whole world, I take it on

[Bridge]

[Verse 3 — Ty Dolla $ign:]
Girl, make that ass clap for young dollar sign
You already know my money go a long time
I could slide for it, like Nelly
I'm a go as far as you let me
Girl, is you sucking me or fucking me or nah?
Can I bring another bitch? Let's have a threesome
Keep saying you's a freak, you gon' prove it or nah?
His bitch keep looking at me, she choosing or nah?
You a ride-or-die chick, you with this shit or nah?
Say you not a side bitch, you all-in or nah?
You gon' make them eggs cheesy with them grits or nah?
