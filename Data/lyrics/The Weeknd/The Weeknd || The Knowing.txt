
I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did

You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
Well baby it's okay
I swear it's okay

'Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything

Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
Trying to keep me up
And you are dry
Well baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did

You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
It's okay, yeah

I know everything, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know everything, yeah
I know everything
I know everything
