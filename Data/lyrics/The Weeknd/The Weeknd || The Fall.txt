[Verse 1]
You've been picking my voice to dance to
You said my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some choppers in my car
What kind of caps I got the finest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all before we pop 'em all

[Hook:]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feel so good
It feel so good

I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
And I ain't scared of the fall
And I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

[Verse 2]
Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula banish
Call a friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexis
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
Best believe already spent it
My girl full of PC
My cup full of Texas
Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you don't gotta ask "who's next?"

[Hook]

Oh whoa
And I ain't scared of the fall [x3]
I felt the ground before [x3]
Before
And I ain't scared of the fall

XO [x5]

Oh, oh
