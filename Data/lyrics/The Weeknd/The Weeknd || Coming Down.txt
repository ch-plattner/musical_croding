
I got somethin' to tell you
But don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing:
Girl, I been bad again
Girl, I been bad again 

Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em but I'm fading
I forget
I forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

Pick 
Up
Your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm 
All alone
I'm feeling everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
[x2]

Poppin' again
I tried to quit again 
I'm always tight wit' somethin I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end 
So play what I take, I take what I spend baby
I ain't lyin' to nobody but me
And you
And me 
But you especially 

Pick 
Up
Your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm 
All alone
I'm feeling everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
[x2]

Pick up your phone
I'm all alone 
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
[x2]
