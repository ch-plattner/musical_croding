
You make it look like itâ€™s magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used

[Pre-hook:]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Hook:]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause, girl, you earned it (shit)
Girl, you earned it, yeah

You know our love would be tragic (oh, yeah)
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

[Pre-hook & hook]

On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us (only us)
Convinced we were broken inside (shit), inside (shit)

[Hook]
