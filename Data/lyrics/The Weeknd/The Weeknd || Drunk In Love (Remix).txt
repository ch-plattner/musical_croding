[Verse 1]
I've been mixing
I've been sipping
Since I been 20 on that lean, baby girl
I've been popping
And I've been rolling
Since I was 17 I've been geekin on that water
I want you, na na
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you
Na na

Don't take my number
Don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you
I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, na na
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you
Na na

[Hook]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this shit happen oh baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back
Nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor
That's why she walking kind of funny
Should've never put us on
Bitch I'm only 24 and
Everybody salty
Niggas stop your bitching
Everybody making money we don't need to kick it
I'm chilling with my niggas every body got a crib
Did an album just to do it
Dropping albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week
I don't sleep
Fuck my enemies
Trying to stay sane is like a full time hobby
Everything I do fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic
My tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the morning models passed out in the shower

[Hook]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this shit happen oh baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
