[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I feel the blood rushin' throughout ya body
You see the scars painted over my skin
I'm always numb to the topic of loving
I fell in love with the subject of sin

[Bridge:]
I don't have to remind you, oh ohhh
It's my need to confine you, oh ohhh
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you?
Put your feelings behind you
I don't have to remind you (don't have to remind you)

[Hook:]
Where you belong [x16]

[Verse 2:]
I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm, inside of you and I
I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want

[Bridge]

[Hook]
