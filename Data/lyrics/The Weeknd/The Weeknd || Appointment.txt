
Got my fancy clothes
And the candles lit
Dinner's getting cold
Can't quit seem to sit
And I've been anxious all day
Ever since you called, you called
Got the water running
Just like you said
Now my body's burning and I start to sweat
And I could never do what we do
All alone, alone

Girl it's half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment

Now I feel the urge, I hope you feel it to
Now imagine girl what I'm a do to you
Girl the image of your body got me sprung, me sprung
Never felt like this about another one
You are killing me girl cause it's half past one
And my body trembles every time my clock agrees

Girl it's half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment

Girl it's half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment

I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you
