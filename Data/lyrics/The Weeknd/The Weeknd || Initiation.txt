
Oh yeah
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish it’s a fucking celebration

For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you ain't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you ain't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you ain't gotta check the sky
We be going all night, til light

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys

You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
Thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out

Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO, [x8]
