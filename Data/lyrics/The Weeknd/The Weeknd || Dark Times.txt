[Ed Sheeran:]
Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow, one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy

[Ed Sheeran:]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

[Ed Sheeran:]
In my dark time I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time, in my dark time

[The Weeknd:]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

[The Weeknd:]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

[The Weeknd:]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

[Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd:]
In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time

[Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd:]
In my dark time, taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark time, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time, taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark time
In my dark times
