
Saw my signal from afar
Lonely heart sitting at the bar
I'ma try to save you from his flames
Come with me, you don't have to think
Had a long day I could tell by your drink
Take a look at me, I promise I will be,
All the things you wanted him to be

Do you, always seem to fight cause I, can tell
Wipe away 'em tears and I,
Can help, help you through your misery,
Hospitality that you need from me
And, girl, I can hear the pain inside, your voice
Argue every night, but that's a choice and I can take it all away

Let me rescue you,
I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you,
Let me fill his shoes,
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there,
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero
Fly you through the stars
Let me light up your darkness
I can be your superhero

Tryna free you from his cage,
It's a mental prison break
Baby, we can leave, my heart is the key
You're a damsel in distress
Looking at your eyes I can see the stress
Take a look at me, promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

Do you, always seem to fight cause I, can tell
Wipe away 'em tears and I,
Can help, help you through your misery,
Hospitality that you need from me
And, girl, I can hear the pain inside, your voice
Argue every night, but that's a choice and I can take it all away

Let me rescue you,
I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you,
Let me fill his shoes,
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there,
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your darkness
I can be your superhero

I can take you away (take you away)
From the darkness and the pain (darkness and the pain)
Girl, I promise every moments for you (Ooh)
Show you never-ending love (never-ending love)
I can bring you from above (bring you from above)
Girl, I can heal your wounds

Let me rescue you,
I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you,
Let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there,
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your darkness
I can be your superhero

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your darkness
I can be your superhero

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero (Ooh ooh, ooh)
