
I just want to take you there
He don't got to know where
Does he touch you here like this?
Let me take the friction from your lips

And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'mma give you girl, what you feel
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

I got everything you want from me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty watch me knock your boots off

And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'mma give you girl, what you feel
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
