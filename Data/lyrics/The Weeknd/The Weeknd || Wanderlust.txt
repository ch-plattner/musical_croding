
It was so hard to say the same thing
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Girl don't hold onto your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me
Good girls go to heaven,
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care

(Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you)
[x2]

You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

You're too shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronize
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
Cause tonight I'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(I leave it all to you)
I leave it all to you
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(Let it come to you)
[x2]

You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all

You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(I leave it all to you)
I leave it all to you
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(Let it come to you)
[x3]
