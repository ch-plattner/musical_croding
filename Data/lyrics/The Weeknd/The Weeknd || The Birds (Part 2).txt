
Woah With a nigga like me
Woah With a nigga like me
She said please
Mercy me
Mercy me
Let me fall out of love
Before you fuck her
Before you fuck her
She begged me
She gave me all her pills
Now her back hurts
Oh she lost control

Now she pleading
She on the floor
She on the floor
Baby girl quite pleading
She on the floor
She on the floor
She said it won't be long
Before she falls out of love
It won't be long
Before she falls out of love
Yeah

[Sample]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this:
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
Your just a bird

Just a bird
I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
I'm not him
I'm not him

Look what you did
Nobody forced your hand
Don't you fall for a nigga like me
I begged, I begged

Now you're pleading
She on the floor
She on the floor
Now you're pleading
She on the floor
She on the floor
She said it won't be long
Before she falls out of love
It won't be long
Before she falls out of love
Yea

[Sample]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this:
You're gonna leave (if she only knew) her
You have deceived her
Just a girl (just a bird)
Just a girl (just a bird)
Just a girl (just a bird)
Just a girl (just a bird)
Just a girl (just a bird) - [to fade]
