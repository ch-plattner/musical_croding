[Intro]
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera

Oui j’ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j’ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas

I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Know you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
Cus I’m not as hard as I make it seem to be
And it could have went so many ways, so many ways it can go
Cus ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone
So if I said that I won’t call then that could come natural to me
You probably could have had it all you could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on (oh yeah)
If we just went on
If we just went on

Happiness exists, when you don’t know a thing
So I hope you don’t think this song is about you..
And only I can know, how close you came..
But baby I’m a pro at letting go. I love it when they come and go
But it could have went so many ways, so many ways it can go
Cus ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone
So If I said that I won’t call then that could come natural to me
You probably could have had it all you could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on (yeah)
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on (oooh baby)
If we just went on
If we just went on (oh yeah)
If we just went on (oh yeah)
Yeh!
