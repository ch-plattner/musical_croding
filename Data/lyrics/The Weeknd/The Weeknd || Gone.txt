I got you
I got a hold of you
Said you want to see
How we roll
Well take a seat (Oh take a seat)
And we'll just
Break it, drop it, drink it spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
Don't you worry, you gotta keep up
'Cause I been gone, I been gone, I been gone, I been gone

Girl
Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby
'Cause I been on, on, on, on
You can see for yourself, little lady
Girl, I lit a little something
Something something, for you
There's enough to pass around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh we'll just break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
Gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
'Cause I been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone

I hope I make it home
You'll be thinking of
I got the whole city on my side tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us live it up
After the show is done
You can take take me to yours

But my lungs so muddy
I love the way you taste
Drink it 'til I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denim
Baby girl I gotcha
I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feeling kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'm a give you what you fiend, oh.

But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm falling
'Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fucking Oscar
By the way I fucking did it
And you'll never fucking know
I'll never fucking show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion

Dirty sprite toasting
Fast live fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the meds flow
Let the night flow
I'm so I'm so gone
Let these meds flow
I'm so gone
Let these meds flow
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
Whoa, whoa, oh
Said I'm gone gone gone
Whoa oh

I'm so gone
Gone
