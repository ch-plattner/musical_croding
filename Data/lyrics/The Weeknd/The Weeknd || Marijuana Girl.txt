[Hook]
Cause you're my marijuana girl
Taking me higher, I want you girl
You got that fire, my flower girl
The smell I desire (puff puff) [x2]
Exhale

Please baby, please
Got me begging on my knees I
Get you high in the worst way like a feen
Got my body feeling thirsty I
Break you down, lay you out, roll you up
Couple licks take a hit(s)
Up up away we go, up up away we go
Up up away we go

[Hook]

I need [?] your loving
All your fucking loving
Colors never seen so bright
Sounds never sound so tight
Just a little taste, text to the place
We'll both synchronize
Our hip toes and eyes
Up up away we go, up up away we go
Up up away we go

[Hook]

[Outro]
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
Gonna set this place on fire
Gonna set this place on fire
