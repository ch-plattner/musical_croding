[Verse 1:]
Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

[Bridge]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you could ever do me right

[Hook]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

[Verse 2:]
And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club

[Bridge]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
(never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long
(you never thought it could last so long)
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
(I been alone for most of my life)
What makes that you think you could ever do me right

[Hook]
