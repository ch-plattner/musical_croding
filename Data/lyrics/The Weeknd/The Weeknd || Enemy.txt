
Oh oh, oh oh
So back, I'm so bad, I'm so bad
Can I be honest with you please?
It's really hard for me to speak right now
Girl, I been drinkin' all day
It's been a long week
Can't you tell by my face?
I wanna lose myself between your legs
I wanna make your body shake
Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase
I promise you'll have nothing to say, nothing to say
Cause the least I deserve this no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

[Hook]
I'm just trying to take you home without a word
Girl I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
Girl I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
Girl I'm just trying to get you high without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word

Please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, get what I want this time

I forgot what it feels to regret my sins
I need that old thing back baby
You can help me out baby
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration
We can put it in a song, if you want
But the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

[Hook]
I'm just trying to take you home without a word
And I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
And I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
And I'm just trying to get you high without a word
And I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
And I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
And I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word

Please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, get what I want this time

I never fall for a girl like you
I'll never understand what you're going through
But your body wild, and your head game too
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too
Cause baby, I ain't cuffing, girl I hope you knew
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "what did I do?"
Girl you know what you did, all to blame is you
Now the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

[Hook]
I'm just trying to take you home without a word
Girl I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
Girl I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
Girl I'm just trying to get you high without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
Girl I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word
