Can’t you see?
It won’t mean a thing to me
I’ve been doing this too long
Baby girl, I’ve felt it all
So watch out
If you try to play your luck
Ain’t nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall

[Hook]
So don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear I’m just a bird
Girl, I’m just another bird
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like Me

You tried
You tried to warn me
But baby, I’m warning you
Girl, I’ll show you
This is no game
You’ll be falling to the point of no return
No return

[Hook]

I know you’re rolling hard with it, don’t lie
I know it’s got a hold of you
I know you’re rolling with it
Baby don’t you lie
Baby

I know you’re rolling hard with it, don’t lie
I know it’s got a hold of you
I know you’re rolling with it
Baby don’t you lie
Baby

So don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cuz girl I’m just a bird
I’m just another bird
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
