The fliest hips that caught my eyes
Girl, I understand if you don’t want a man
But I gotta get in there
I gotta get in (there)
I gotta get in (there)
I gotta get in (there) (caramel honey gon' melt in my mouth, melt, melt in my mouth)
So good

You got it, got it, got it
You’re so sweet, can I try your honeycomb?
Want it, want it, want it
Impatient, can I get the keys to your home, home, home, home?
