[Verse 1:]
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth she can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me, I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit baby, I'm a little camera shy
But exceptions can be made baby, cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

[Bridge:]
Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook:]
Oh
(Please don't check in my pillow)
(Please don't check in my pillow)
Oh girl
Don't hold back
(Please don't check in my pillow)
(Please don't check in my pillow)
Oh girl
Don't hold back
Let it out
(Please don't check in my pillow)
(Please don't check in my pillow)
Don't hold back
Let it out
(Please don't check in my pillow)
(Please don't check in my pillow)
Don't hold back

[Verse 2:]
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you 'to my west coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, tryna finish all this potion
Baby take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still hot, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong, and never sleep until it's mornin'

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside, so you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that one time, believe my driver gettin' fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks, Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russian with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of your tongue rings
She likes the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make it harder, with gold grills
I make her suck, with gold grills
In the back room, In the VIP
She don't ever sleep...

[Outro x2:]
This ain't nothing to relate to [x4]
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
