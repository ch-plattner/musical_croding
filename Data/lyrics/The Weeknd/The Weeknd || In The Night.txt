In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It made her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

I don't think you understand...

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
