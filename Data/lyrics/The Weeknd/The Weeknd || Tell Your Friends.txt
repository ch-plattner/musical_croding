
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they’re about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill

Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I’m talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
