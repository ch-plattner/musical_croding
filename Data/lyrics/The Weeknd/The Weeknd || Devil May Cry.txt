
It won't be in vain
To swallow all your pain
And learn to love what burns
And gather courage to return to...

[x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain

[x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient

[x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
