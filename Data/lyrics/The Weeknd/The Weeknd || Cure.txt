Need some cure for this disease
I’ve been cursed with L.U.V.
With my visions bleed, my memories, of all the time we spent
Now I’m left with only me, and my body’s feeling weak
I can’t believe I didn’t see, this moment come so fast

You’ve been swimming through my vein, vein, vein
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain 
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space

Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away

I let your soul inside of me, and your pain refused to leave
It’s hard to breath when memories refuse to fade away
Won’t stop when you shut the door, all my life never think you'd go, there you go...

You’ve been swimming through my vein, vein, vein
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space

Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away
