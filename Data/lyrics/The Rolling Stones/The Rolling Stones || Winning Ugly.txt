
I wanna be on top.
Forever on the up and damn the competition.
I never play it fair,
I never turn a hair,
just like the politicians.
I wrap my conscience up.
I wanna win that cup and get my money, baby.
But, back in the dressing room
the other side is weeping.
And we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly.
And we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly.
And we're heading for the heartbreak,
heading for the blues. Yeah.
And we're heading for the heartbreak,
heading for the blues.
And we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly.
I will not act unkind,
I will not be so blind,
I will not walk so proud,
come down from off my cloud.
How can I live my life this way?
A beauty is staring me in the face,
ain't that the truth?
Ain't that the truth?
Hold on, (Huuu huuu hu!) oh, c'mon girl.
(Huuu huuu hu!) Ha, c'mon girl.
Look out for number one.
My country right or wrong,
let the devil take the hindmost.
I was brought up to cheat
so long as the referee wasn't looking.
I'm never wrong at all.
I always fight the call.
I don't admit it.
But back in the dressing room
the other side is a screaming.
And we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly. Yeah.
And we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly. Ha, ha.
And we're heading for the heartbreak,
heading for the blues, ya.
And I'm heading for the heartbreak,
heading for the blues.
Yeah, and we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly, yeah.
I will not act unkind,
I will not be so blind,
I will not walk so proud,
come down from off my cloud.
How can I live my life this way?
A beauty is staring me in the face,
ain't that the truth?
Ain't that the truth?
Come on baby!
Come on girl!
A little bit louder!
Walk a little bit prouder!
(Huuu huuu hu!)
Meow, wait I am, wait I am, wait I am ...
(Huuu huuu hu!)
Yeah, and we're winning (winning), winning (winning) ugly.
That's allright.
Winning (winning), winning (winning), winning ugly.
Come on girl.
Watch me saying (winning) winning (winning), winning ugly.
Ah, and I'm winning (winning), winning (winning) winning ugly.
Winning ugly!
Come on (winning), stay away (winning ugly),
step over girl, step over girl, come on.
Come on, (winning) come on (winning ugly).
It's allright, it's allright.
