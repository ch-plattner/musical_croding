
Love is strong and you're so sweet
You make me hard you make me weak
Love is strong and you're so sweet
And some day, babe we got to meet
A glimpse of you was all it took
A stranger's glance it got me hooked
And I followed you across the stars
I looked for you in seedy bars
What are you scared of, baby
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team
Beautiful team
Love is strong and you're so sweet
And some day, babe we got to meet
Just anywhere out in the park
Out on the street and in the dark
I followed you through swirling seas
Down darkened woods with silent trees
Your love is strong and your so sweet
You make me hard you make me weak
I wait for you until the dawn
My mind is ripped my heart is torn
And love is strong and your so sweet
Your love is bitter it's taken neat
