
Hear the voice of experience,
a word from the wise.
Grab opportunity, yes, while you're alive.
'Cause if you follow the crowd,
'cause if you act like a coward,
you'll end up yelling out loud.
Hold back.
You'll regret it someday.
Choke on that.
Don't let it pass you by.
Hold back.
You better seize the hour.
If you look in your history book,
if you delve in the past.
Stalin and Roosevelt, yeah, they both took their chances.
And George grasped the nettle.
It's do or dare
from the banks of the Delaware.
Yeah, don't hold back.
Trust your gut reaction.
Be bold, be bold, baby.
Mmm, if you don't take chances, you won't make advances.
Hold back, yeah.
Don't matter if you ain't so good looking,
if you ain't sharp as a blade.
Na, don't be afraid.
Don't hold back.
Life is passing you by.
Choke on that.
Keep on moving, keep on moving, yeah.
Yes, you run with the crowd, yeah.
You will end up in the madhouse shouting those cold walls down.
Ya, don't hold back.

Hold back, you're messing with your life.
Hold back.
Yeah, life goes by fast sometimes.
Be bold, be bold, be bold, be bold baby.
You're wastin' your time.
I want your attention, so pin back your ears.
I've been climbing this tree of promises for over forty years.
Your vision get broken
and bust on the ground.
So watch me, watch me rebound.
Yeah, don't hold back, you wrecking your life.
Choke on that. Yeah!
Don't hold back,
you're messing with your life ...
