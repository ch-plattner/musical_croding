You got me doing something
I thought I'd never will do
Give me one more, one more shot
And it's all I got
Give you one more shot

And take me back
I'm all yours Jack
Yeah you got me freakin'
Yeah I'm over heat, just when things are sweet
You can't meet on the street

Give me one more, one more shot
Yeah and it's all I got
And doing up on me (one more shot)

I'll make your play,
Yeah, make my day
Put me in correction for my own protection
In your jurisdiction spare the crucifixion
Give me one more shot
Baby it's all I got
Baby don't freeze up on me
(One more shot)

I love, I love, I love, I love, I love [3x]

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

(One more shot)
Give me one, give me one more shot
Yeah and it's all I got
Just one more
(One more shot)
Give me one, give me one more, one
Give me one more shot
Yeah, babe
Give me one more shot
Na na na na na na na na na
Give me one more shot
