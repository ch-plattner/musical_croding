When love comes so late, it'll really hit hard 
It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard 
Everyone said, "What a perfect love match 
'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch" 

I was drinking in love, gulping it down 
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud 
But after awhile I stopped to rebel 
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 

We'd been living together for over a year 
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear 
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray 
The little things big, that's what they say 

I acted impatient, I acted unkind 
I took her for granted, I played with her mind 
She didn't deserve it but it was too late 
I walked out the door and left her to her fate 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

(WhoooWhooo Whooo....)

Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone 
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone 
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch 
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch 

But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised 
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights

'Cause I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
Well I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
