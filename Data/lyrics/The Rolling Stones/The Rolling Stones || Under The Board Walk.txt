When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
On the park you'll hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
