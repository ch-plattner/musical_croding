Melody, it was a second name
Melody, it was a second name

Came home one morning about quarter to three
I'm banging on my door cause I just lost my key
Open up, baby, you got someone else inside
I'm going to come get you dead or alive

I took her out dancing but she drank away my cash
She said, "I'm going to fix my face don't you worry I'll be back"
I'm looking for her high and low like a mustard for a ham
She was crashed out in the bathroom
In the arms of my best friend

Then one day she left me
She took everything that moved
My car, she took my trailer home
She took my Sunday boots
My nose is on her trail
I'm going to catch her by surprise
Then I'm going to have the pleasure
To roast that child alive
