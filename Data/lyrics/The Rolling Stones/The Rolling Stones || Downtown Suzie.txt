
Got the Monday mornin' blues 
Monday wasn't really real 
Oh, lying on a naked bed 
With an Alka Seltzer head

Oh, Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Talkin' 'bout Lu, what ya gonna do?
And I feel so bad, have you ever been had? 
I'll dry out sweet Lucy

Took an early morning shower 
Well, I wasted 'bout half an hour 
I heard the ringing of the bell 
It's Lucy with the cleaning towel

Oh, I'm feelin' like the Sunday Times 
Southern Californian wine 
Oh, Lucy kicked me in the hole 
A tennis worth of achin' bones

Oh, Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Lord, Lu, what ya gonna do? 
I feel so bad, have you ever been had? 
Got a dose from now sweet Lucy

Oh, Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Talkin' 'bout Lu, who? What ya gonna do? 
Oh, and I feeling so bad, have you ever been had?
Oh, by thou sweet Lucy
