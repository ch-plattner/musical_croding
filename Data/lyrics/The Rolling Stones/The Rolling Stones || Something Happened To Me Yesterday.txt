Something, I can't speak of right away
Something happened to me, something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Something very strange I hear you say
You're talking in a most peculiar way
But something really threw me, something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday
(Yesterday)

He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause, something

What kinda joint is this?
Take your partners

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Someone says there's something more to pay
For sins that you committed yesterday
It's really rather drippy but something, oh, so trippy
Something happened to me yesterday

Right, he don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause, something

Someone's singing loud across the bay
Sittin' on a mat about to pray
Isn't half as looney as something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

Right, he don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Well, thank you very much and now I think it's time for us all to go
So from all of us to all of you not forgetting the boys in the band
And our producer, Reg Thorpe, we'd like to say "God Bless"
So, if you're out tonight, don't forget, if you're on your bike, wear white
Amen
