
Well, you've grown up all wrong, well you've grown up all wrong
You come on too strong, well you've grown up all wrong
Well, you were easy to fool when you were in school
But you've grown up all wrong

Well, you've grown up on me, well you've grown up on me
Don't believe what I see, well you've grown up on me
Well, you look so sweet when you're in your jeans
But you've grown up on me, raise your hands

Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast
Don't forget about the past, girl you've grown up too fast
Well you won't be a fool but I'm through with you
Well, you've grown up too fast, well you've grown up too fast
