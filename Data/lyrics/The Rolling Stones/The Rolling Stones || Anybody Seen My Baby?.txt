She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to etherial
With a kind of down to earth flavor
Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
Getting on a motor bike
Looking rather lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?
Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Is she really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around
[Rap]
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around
Lost, lost and never found
I must have called her a thousand times
Sometimes I think she's just in my imagination
Lost in the crowd
