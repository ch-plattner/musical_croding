Down and down she goes, oh, Amanda Jones
I said down and down and down and down
She'd look really lovely at home
Till somebody gonna come up and ask her
To live happily ever after, Miss Amanda Jones

On and on she goes, little miss Amanda Jones
I said on and on and on and on
Just watch her as she grow
Don't wanna say it very obviously
But she's losing her nobility, miss Amanda Jones

Hey girl, don't you realize
The money invested in you?
Hey girl, you just got to find
Someone who'll really pull your family through

Up and up she goes, our Amanda Jones
I said up and up and up and up
She looks quite delightfully stoned
She's the darling of the discotheque crowd
Of her lineage, she's rightfully proud, miss Amanda Jones

Hey girl, with your nonsense nose
All pointing right down at the floor
Hey girl, your suspender shows
And the girl behind you looks a bit unsure

Round and round she goes, the world of Amanda Jones
I said round and round and round and round
The balls and the dinners and show
The little girl, she just wanders about
Till it's time for her coming out, miss Amanda Jones

Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
...
