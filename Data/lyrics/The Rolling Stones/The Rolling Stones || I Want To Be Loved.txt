
The stars in your eyes sets my soul on fire 
Your voice is like an angel above me 
The touch of your hand drives me insane 
But baby, I want to be loved

I'm crazy 'bout every little thing you do 
I cherish the way you hug me 
Your kiss so sweet, honey, it can't be beat 
But baby, I want to be loved

Every time I ask you for a date 
You don't come at all or you're mighty late 
I ask you to dance, take a little spin 
You say, "Wait a minute, daddy, here come's my friend"

I love the way you walk when you pass me 
by And even when you try to snub me 
You kiss me, baby when you give me the eye 
But baby, I want to be loved, alright

Yeah, every time I ask you for a date 
You don't come at all or you're mighty late 
I ask you to dance, take a little spin 
You say, "Wait a minute, daddy, here come's my friend"

I love the way you walk when you pass me by 
And even when you try to snub me 
You kiss me, honey when you give me the eye 
But baby, I want to be loved.
