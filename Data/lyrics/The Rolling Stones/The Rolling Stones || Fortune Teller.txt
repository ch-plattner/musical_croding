
Went to the fortune teller 
Had my fortune read 
I didn't know what to tell her 
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Then she took a look at my palm 
She said, "Sonny, you feel kinda warm" 
And she looked into her crystal ball 
And said, "You're in love"

I said, "I couldn't be so 
I'm not in passion with the girls I know"
She said, "When the next one arrives 
You'll be looking into her eyes"

I left there in a hurry 
Looking forward to my big surprise 
The next day I discovered 
That the fortune teller told me a lie

I hurried back down to that woman 
As mad as I could be 
I told her I didn't see nobody 
Why'd she make a fool out of me

Then somethin' struck me 
As if they came from up above 
While lookin' at the fortune teller 
I fell in love

Now I'm a happy fellow 
Well, I'm married to the fortune teller 
We're happy as we could be 
Now I get my fortune told for free

Now I'm a happy fellow 
Well, I'm married to the fortune teller 
We're happy as we could be 
And I get my fortune told for free
