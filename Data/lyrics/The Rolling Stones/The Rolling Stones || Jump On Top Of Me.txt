I've been working so hard and feelin' no pain 
Sure got pains in my head, my legs feel limp 
Don't want to hear no noise, don't want to hear you cuss 
I need peace of mind, don't you make no fuss

Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
Give it to me nice and slow

Well there's too much talkin', 'bout this an' that 
And the window needs fixin', better feed the cat 
We're fresh out of beer, could you answer the phone 
Well you call this bisque, well I'm leavin' home

Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
Give it to me nice and slow, alright

Well jump on top of me baby 
jump on top of me baby 
Get on top of me girl 
Everybody lay down low

When we first met, we were both so young 
We didn't give a damn, how the clock would run 
The time is right, to make some fool of you 
'Cause it's gettin' late, what would you like to do

Jump on top of me baby 
Get on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
Give it to me nice and slow, alright

Well, jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
And give it to me nice and slow

Alright, jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
Everybody lay down low

Alright, jump on top of me baby 
Yeah top of me baby 
On top of me girl 
Everybody lay down low

I can't stand it when the sun comes up 
Gonna need some comfort, â€˜cause I can't stand up 
Shut the blinds, I'm gonna shut the shades 
And tell the neighbors, we'll be gone for days

Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me baby 
Jump on top of me girl 
Give it to me nice and slow, alright.
