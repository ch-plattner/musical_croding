
My obsessions are your possessions
Every piece that I can get
My obsessions are your possessions
Till my mouth is soaking wet
I think I blew it now, confession

You can't dodge it, it's simple logic
You'd be better off with me
And you'll know it when you lost it
Lonely

My obsessions are your possessions
Are you smiling on my way
My obsessions are your possessions
One that you should give away
Give it to me now I've no objection

I don't mind if it's unkind
And it's not my property
But I want it just to be mine
Exclusively

Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby, aah

You need teaching, you're a girl
There are things in this world
That need teaching with discretion
My profession

My obsessions are your possessions
Are you used to the idea?
My obsessions are your possessions
Do you feel at home right here?
You should relax, it's my impression

Didn't see you were so young
I could almost be your son
Please turn in my direction
No objection
