
I've been holding out so long 
I've been sleeping all alone 
Lord I miss you 
I've been hanging on the phone 
I've been sleeping all alone 
I want to kiss you 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh 

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep 
You've been staring in my dreams 
Lord I miss you. 
I've been waiting in the hall 
Been waiting on your call 
When the phone rings 
It's just some friends of mine that say, 
"Hey, what's the matter man? 
We're gonna come around at twelve 
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you 
We're gonna bring a case of wine 
Hey, let's go mess and fool around 
You know, like we used to" 

[12" version:]
You've been strung up for her too long, 
You know - girls will come and go -
They're just like streetcars...
I've been staying here too long,
Sometimes I feel so
Abandoned...

Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 

Oh everybody waits so long 
Oh baby why you wait so long 
Won't you come on! Come on! 

I've been walking Central Park 
Singing after dark 
People think I'm crazy 
I've been stumbling on my feet 
Shuffling through the street 
People ask me, "What's the matter with you boy?" 

Sometimes I want to say to myself 
Sometimes I say 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
I won't miss you child 

I guess I'm lying to myself 
It's just you and no one else 
Lord I won't miss you child 
You've been blotting out my mind 
Fooling on my time 
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah 

Lord, I miss you child 

Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 

Lord, I miss you child 

Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 

Lord, I miss you child 

Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah 
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
