
You fell out of the clear blue sky
to the darkness below.
The smell of your flesh excites me,
blood starts to flow, so help me God.
You burst in, in a blase of light,
you unzipper the dark.
One kiss took my breath away,
one look lights up the stars.
And it's, it's one hit to the body.
It comes straight from the heart.
(Straight from the heart)
One hit to the body,
shook me straight to the mark, so help me God.
One more from the body, one more straight from the heart]
