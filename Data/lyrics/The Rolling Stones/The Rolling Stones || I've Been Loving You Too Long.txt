
I've been loving you too long to stop now 
You were tied and you want to be free 
My love is growing stronger as you become a haven to me 
I've been loving you a little too long, I can't stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful, I can't stop now 
You were tied and your love is growing cold 
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old 
I've been loving you, my, my, my, my a little too long 
I don't want to stop now, oh, oh

I've been loving you a little too long, I can't stop now 
Oh, oh, I can't, I can't stop now 
Don't make me stop me now 
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late 
I can't stop, I can't stop now

Don't leave me, don't leave me 
Don't leave me now, my, my, my 
I can't, I can't stop loving you now 
No, no, no 
My, my, my, my, my, my.
