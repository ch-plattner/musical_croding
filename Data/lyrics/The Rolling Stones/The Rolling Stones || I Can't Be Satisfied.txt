
Well, I'm going away to live 
Won't be back no more 
Going back down south, child 
Lord don't you worry 'bout

Woman I'm trouble 
Trouble and all worried mind 
Well, I just can't be satisfied 
Just can't keep on crying

Well, I feel like snapping 
Pistol in your face 
Going to let some graveyard 
Lord be your resting place

Woman I'm trouble 
Trouble and all worried mind 
Yeah, I just can't be satisfied 
Just can't keep on crying

Yeah, I'm all in my sleep 
Hear my doorbell ring 
Looking for my baby 
Lord seen a doggone thing

Woman I'm trouble Trouble 
and all worried mind 
Yeah, I just can't be satisfied 
Just can't keep on crying

Yeah, I know my little old babe 
She gonna jump and shout 
That old train be late man 
Lord I come walking out

Woman I'm trouble 
Trouble and all worried mind 
Yeah, I just can't be satisfied 
Just can't keep on crying, well
