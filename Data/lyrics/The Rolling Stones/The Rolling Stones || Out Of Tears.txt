I can't feel
Feel a thing
I can't shout
I can't scream
Breathe it out
Breathe it in
All this love
From within
I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears
Out of tears
I won't drink
I won't eat
I can't hear
I won't speak
Let it out
Let it in
All this pain
From within
And I just can't pour my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper
I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing
I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears, yes I am
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry
I'm out of tears
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why
I'm out of tears
Out of tears
Out of tears
Let it out
From within
Some you lose
Some you win
I can drift
I can dream
Til I float
Off your screen
And I just can't pour my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper
I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing
I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears
Out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry
I'm out of tears
Out of tears
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why
I'm out of tears
Out of tears
Out of tears
