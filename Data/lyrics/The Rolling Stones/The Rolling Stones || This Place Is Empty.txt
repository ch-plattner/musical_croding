
Walk right in, sit on down 
And make yourself at home 
Come on baby, you're just like me 
And you hate to be alone 

It's funny how things go around 
It's crazy but it's true 
This place is empty, oh so empty 
It's empty without you 

Come on, bare your breasts 
And make me feel at home 
You and me we're just like all the rest 
And we don't want to be alone 

It's funny how things go around 
But go around they do 
This place is empty, empty 
So empty without you 

It's empty without you

Come on, simmer down 
And treat me sweet and cool 
At least by now you have learned 
How to love a fool 

It's funny how things turn around 
It's crazy but it's true 
This place is empty, so empty 
So empty without you
