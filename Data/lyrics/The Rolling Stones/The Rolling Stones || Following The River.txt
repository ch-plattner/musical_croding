There's something I should tell you
Why don't you sit there in that chair
You're looking good today
I love the way your comb's tucked in your hair

My cards are on the table, but the drinks have all run out
There's been some other lads in this room with me, we're really quite a crowd
It's hard to break it gently, but I really thought it through
I don't think there's much future left, for me and you, me and you

I've been following the river, til it joins hands with the sea.
I've been thinking of you so bad
Cause you always saw the best in me

You'll probably forget me, and I'll fade back in the bar
Just a face disappearing without trace, I'll be lost, I'll be lost

One day I'll hear some laughter in a out-of-town cafe
I'll be reaching for your number - I'll be calling out your name, calling out your name

I've been following that river, gonna join hands with the sea
I've been thinking of ya all the time
Cause you always brought the best in me
I'll be following the river - oh my! Till it spills out in the sea

When I first think about ya, oh dear
Cause you always brought the best in me (always brought the best in me)
I'll be following the river (yeah!)
Gonna join hands with the sea

Ah, if I can't have ya, I'll be dreaming all about ya
Cause you always brought the best in me
I'll be following the river, gonna join hands with the sea

I'll be thinking about ya, cause you always brought the best in me
