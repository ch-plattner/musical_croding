
I don't know why I love you, babe 
I don't know why I love you 
I don't know why I love you, baby 
But I love you darlin', yes I do

You always treat me like a fool 
You kick me when I'm down, that's you're rule 
I don't know why I love you, baby 
But I love you

When are you gonna stop your cheatin' ways 
With another guy you laugh in my face 
Just how long must I be in this, disgraced 
'Cause I love you, baby

I don't know, I don't know why, babe 
I don't know, I don't know why, baby 
I don't know why I love you, baby 
But I love you

When are you gonna stop your cheatin' ways 
With another guy you laugh in my face 
Just how long must I be in this, disgraced 
'Cause I love you, baby

I don't know, I don't know why, babe 
I don't know, I don't know why, baby 
I don't know why I love you.
