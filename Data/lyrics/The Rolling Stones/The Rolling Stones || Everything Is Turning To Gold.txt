
Don't care if your love grows cold 
Found love in someone else's home 
Don't like standin' in the snow 
Everything is turning to gold

Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning to gold

You used to know me long ago 
Was so lost and way down low 
Now that the love juice starts to flow 
Now that the love juice starts to flow

Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning to gold

Everything is turning 
(Everything is turning) 
Everything is turning 
(Turning, turning)

Everything is turning 
(Everything is turning) 
Everything is turning 
(Turning, turning)

Everything is turning, hey baby 
(Everything is turning to gold)

Hey baby I'm tired, I'm tired of doing what I'm told
Things are moving way too slow 
I've got no problems, I got no problems, child
It ain't my business, it ain't my business, ain't my style

Now that the love juice starts to flow 
Now that the love juice starts to flow 
Now that the love juice starts to flow

Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning to gold 
Everything is turning 
Everything is turning

Everything is turning 
(Everything is turning) 
Everything is turning 
(Turning, turning)

Everything is turning 
(Everything is turning) 
Everything is turning 
(Turning, turning)

Everything is turning 
(Everything is turning) 
Everything is turning 
(Turning, turning, turning)
Everything is turning
