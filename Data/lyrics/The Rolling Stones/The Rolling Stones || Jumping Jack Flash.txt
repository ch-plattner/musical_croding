We are sorry for the delay

The greatest rock and roll band in the world
The Rolling Stones!)
(Watch it!)
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down, to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, sure and I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, sure
Yeah, I was crowned with a spike right through my head
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
[spoken (Jagger):]
(Oh yeah. Thank you kindly
I think I busted a button on my trousers
Hope they don't fall down.
You don't want my trousers to fall down, now do ya?)
