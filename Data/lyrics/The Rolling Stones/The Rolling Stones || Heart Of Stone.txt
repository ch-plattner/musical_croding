There've been so many girls that I've known
I've made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the street
She's all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet
But, she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone
What's different about her? I don't really know
No matter how I try I just can't make her cry
Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone
Don't keep on looking that some old way
If you try acting sad, you'll only make me glad
Better listen little girl
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, you'll never break this heart of stone darlin
No, no, this heart of stone
You'll never break it darlin
You won't break this heart of stone
Oh no no no
You better go
You better go home
Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone
