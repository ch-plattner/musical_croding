Good evening one and all, we're all so glad to see you here
We'll play your favorite songs while you're all so happy atmosphere
We'll start with 'Old Man River', then maybe 'Stormy Weather', too
I'm sure you know just what to do
On with the show good health to you

Please pour another glass, it's time to watch the cabaret
Your wife will never know that you're not really working late
Your hostess here is Wendy, you'll find her very friendly, too
And we don't care just what you do
On with the show good health to you

Petina, start the show at 2 o'clock

Oh, if by chance you find that you can't make it anymore
We'll put you in a cab and get you safely to the door
But we've got all the answers and we've got lovely dancers, too
There's nothin' else you have to do
On with the show good health to you

You're all such lovely people dancing, eating 'round the floor
But if you have to fight, please take your trouble out the door
For now I say with sorrow until this time tomorrow
We'll bid you all a find adieu
On with the show good health to you
