
And I love you dirty fucker.
Sister and brother,
moanin' in the moonlight.
Singin' for your supper.
'Cos I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
And i had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
Always try to taunt me.
Always seem to haunt me.
Serving out injunctions, shouting out instructions.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with through.
I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
And I love you with a passion.
In and out of fashion,
always up behind you,
others tried to blind you.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you, oh, oh.

And it's such a sad thing to watch a love go down.
I've had you up to here, babe,
I've got to say good bye,
'cause I had it, had it, had it, had it with you.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
Yeah, you know me in the lean years.
Loved you in the fat ones.
You're a mean mistreater.
You're a dirty, dirty rat scum!
Ya I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with through.
And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you.
Ooh I had it, had it, had it, had it with you.
Had it with you.
Had it with you.
Had it with you.

Had it with you.
Had it with you.
Had it with you.
Huuh!
Had it with you.
Had it with you.

Yuh!
