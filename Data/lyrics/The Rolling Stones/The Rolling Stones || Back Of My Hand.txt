
I hear a preacher on the corner 
Ranting like a crazy man 
He says there's trouble, troubles are coming 
I can read it like the back of my hand 

I see love, I see misery 
Jamming side by side on the stage 
In the wind some mournful melody 
I can read it like the back of my hand 

The back of my hand.....  Oh yeah 

Oh yeah.... 

I see dreams, I see visions 
Images I don't understand 
I see Goya's paranoias 
I can read it like the back of my hand 

Well, read it like the back of my hand 
Oh yeah, wow yeah 
Wow yeah 
Read it like the back of my hand
