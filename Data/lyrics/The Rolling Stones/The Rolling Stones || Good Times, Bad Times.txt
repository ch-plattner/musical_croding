
There've been good times
There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times, too
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you
Remember the good times we've had together
Don't you want them back again
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey, now it's a sin
There's gotta be trust in this world
Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war
