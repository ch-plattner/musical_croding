
The lights go out, I am all alone
All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spend my night dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me and it never lets me go

[Chorus]
I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know

My dear old friend, take me for a spin
Two wolves in the dark, running in the wind
I'm letting go, but I've never felt better
Passing by all the monsters in my head

[Chorus]

And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show

[Chorus]

And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show
