
Open my chest and carve out the spine
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all
Swallow my breath
And take what is mine
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all

I'll be the blood
If you'll be the bones
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all
So lift up my body
And lose all control
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all

You hover like a hummingbird
Haunt me in my sleep
You'll say you're from another world
Sinking in my seat, oh
You're feeding on my energy
Letting go of it
She wants in

And I run from wolves
Breathing heavily
At my feet
And I run from wolves
Tearing into me
Without teeth

I can see through you
We are the same
It's perfectly strange
You run in my veins
How can I keep you
Inside my lungs
I breathe what is yours
You breathe what is mine

You hover like a hummingbird
Haunt me in my sleep
You'll say you're from another world
Sinking in my seat, oh
You're feeding on my energy
Letting go of it
He wants in

And I run from wolves
Breathing heavily
At my feet
And I run from wolves
Tearing into me
Without teeth

And you can follow
You can follow me
You can follow
You can follow me

You hover like a hummingbird
Haunt me in my sleep
You'll say you're from another world
Sinking in my seat, oh
"You're feeding on my energy
Letting go of it" she once said

And I run from wolves
Breathing heavily
At my feet
And I run from wolves
Tearing into me
Without teeth

And you can follow
You can follow me
You can follow
You can follow me
You can follow
You can follow me
You can follow
You can follow me
