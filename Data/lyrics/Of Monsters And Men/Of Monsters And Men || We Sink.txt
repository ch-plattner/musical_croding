
All those eyes on me
As I sink into the open sea
Color in my sheltered mind
Fill the gap between you and I

We are the sleepers
We bite our tongues
We set the fire
And we let it burn
Through the dreamers
We hear the hum
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go."
So come on, come on, let's go

It's warm, the skin I'm living in
It creates and shapes what is within
So please look away, don't look at me
As we sink into the open sea

We are the sleepers
We bite our tongues
We set the fire
And we let it burn
Through the dreamers
We hear the hum
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go."

We are the sleepers
We bite our tongues
We set the fire
And we let it burn
Through the dreamers
We hear the hum
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go."

So come on, come on, let's go

I know that it's a waste of time
Chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded minds
'Til time ignites a spark

I know that it's a waste of time
Chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded minds
'Til time ignites a spark

I know that it's a waste of time
Chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded minds
'Til time ignites a spark
