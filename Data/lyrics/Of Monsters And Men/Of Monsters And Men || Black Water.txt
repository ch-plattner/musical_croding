I need nothing
To travel the sea
I need nothing
I need nothing
But there's something
Eating beneath
Black water
Take over

Swallowed by a vicious vengeful sea
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
See myself through someone else

The strange silence
Surrounding me
Grows closer
Feels colder
But I'm to ready
To suffer the sea
Black water
Take over

Swallowed by a vicious vengeful sea
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
See myself through someone else

Swallowed by a vicious vengeful sea
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
See myself through someone else

Swallowed by a vicious vengeful sea
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
See myself through someone else
