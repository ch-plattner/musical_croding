
What are they talking about
On the weekends?
Lost in the forest of this heart
Is a foreign still

Why are they shaking their heads?
We're stuck in slow life
Is it the beating of the chest?
That makes us fear the rest

We're slowly sailing away
Behind closed eyes
Where not a single ray of light
Can puncture through the night

You caught me in the tide
And I caught you
Sheltered by the night
Red in tooth and red in claw

You saw me in new light
And I saw you
Sheltered by the night
Red in tooth and red in claw

Between the daylight
And the deep sea
Lies a swarm of silhouettes
Floating aimlessly

But I'm a mountain
I am a killer
You'll get lost and buried deep
If you swim with me

You caught me in the tide
And I caught you
Sheltered by the night
Red in tooth and red in claw

You saw me in new light
And I saw you
Sheltered by the night
Red in tooth and red in claw

So look at you look at me
All because we need to know
So look at me look at you
All because we'll never know

So look at you look at me
All because we need to know
So look at me look at you
All because we'll never know
