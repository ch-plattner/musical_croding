Oh, I miss the comfort of this house.
Where we are, where we are.
Where we are, where we are.
The floor under our feet whispers out,
"Come on in, come on in, where it all begins."

Can you chase this fire away?

The tallest man I've ever seen afloat,
On a boat, on a boat.
On a boat, on a boat.
He keeps his only son close by.
In a bag, in a bag.
In a bag on his back.

Can you chase this fire away?
Can you chase this fire away?

We climbed up to the top in worn out shoes,
But she ran down, she ran down.
She ran down to the house.
A fox that gains our trust but then breaks it as he walks
Away from us, away from us.

Can you chase this fire away?
Can you chase this fire away?

In the fall we sleep all day
In the fall we sleep all day

Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
[repeat]

Can you chase the fire away?
Can you chase the fire away?

In the fall we sleep all day
In the fall we sleep all day

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
