Unto this storm, unto this storm
Unto this storm and wait
I can't control wither in wonders
Flowers that lose their shape

I lie awake and watch it all diffuse
Like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all diffuse
Like thousand eyes

I'll be the call, I will be quiet
Stripped to the bone, I wait
No, I'll be a stone, I'll be the hunter
Tower that casts a shade

I lie awake and watch it all diffuse
Like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all diffuse
Like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all diffuse
Like thousand eyes

I am the storm, I am the storm
I am the storm, so wait
