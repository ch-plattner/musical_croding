
The sea said goodbye to the shore so the sun wouldn't notice
The seaweed that wrapped its arms around you

The carpet on my cheek feels like a forest
And I run through the tall trees with your hand chasing me

The books that I keep by my bed are full of your stories
That I drew up from a little dream of mine, a little nightmare of yours

To be asked to take this plunge, to forgive and forget
And be the better man, to be a better man, to be a better man

So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well

The cat's silhouette as big as a monster in this concrete jungle
With street lights hanging their heads

So make all your last demands for I will forsake you
And I'll meet your eyes for the very first time, for the very last

So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my brother as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my sister as well
So love me mother, and love me father, and love my brother as well

I met a man today and he smiled back at me
Now there are thoughts like these that keep me on my feet, that keep me on my feet
