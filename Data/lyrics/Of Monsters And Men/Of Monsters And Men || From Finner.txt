
We came here on his back
And we caught your eye.
The salty ocean wind
Made the seagulls cry.
The rocking of his house
Had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe
From there on out.

And the waves that hit his face
Marked the past
And the furrows on his skin,
Oh, how time goes fast.
And we are far, far from home but we're so happy.
Far from home, all alone, but we're so happy.

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

After every sunny day
Came a stormy night,
That's when Finner would say,
“Keep your heads held high”.
And we are far, far from home but we're so happy.
Far from home, all alone but we're so happy.

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

And we are far, far from home but we're so happy.
Far from home, all alone, but we're so happy

Hey, hey
