Slow, slow me down,
Her blood, on my bones.
Let go, lay to rest.

We fall, we fall, we fall,
We fall to the ground.

Sleep, sleep all night
While the young, they wait alone.
So get up, shake the rust.
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl,
We crawl on the ground.

Alone, I fight these animals.
Alone, until I get home.

A wolf, wolf and I,
We share the same cold meal.
I float on, float on down.
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all out.

We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all 
Ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all out.

[x4:]
Alone, I fight these animals.
Alone, until I get home.

Coming back, I'm coming back.
Coming back, I'm coming back.
She follows me into the woods,
Takes me home
She follows me into the woods,
Takes me home

[x3:]
Coming back, I'm coming back.
Coming back, I'm coming back.
She follows me into the woods,
Takes me home
