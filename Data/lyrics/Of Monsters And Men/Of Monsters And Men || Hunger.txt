
You are right, I'll move on
But my lungs feel so small
I couldn't breathe if I tried
I lay my head on the floor
My beating heart wanting more
But I'll keep it in and keep you out

I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning

But for the longest time I knew
There was nothing left for us to do
But I tried, oh, I tried
And in this quiet company
There is nothing staring back at me
I'm in need of the sound

Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
Voices disappear when you are speaking, in somber tunes
I will be the wolf and when you're starving, you'll need it too
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
It isn't you, it isn't

And I'll go talk to fill the void,
Let me go cause you are just a shade
Of what I am, not what I'll be
But in this quiet company
I forget sometimes just how to breathe
Fill my lungs with the sound

Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
Voices disappear when you are speaking, in somber tunes
I will be the wolf and when you're starving, you'll need it too
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
It isn't you, it isn't

I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
