
Stop, you're cold against the skin
Take me in your arms when walls are closing in
And I run, I run, I run, awakening my heart
But you overwhelm my lungs and it's tearing me a-part

You and I will not be shaken!
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

Stop, I will take control
Bend the metal in-to shapes that I, know
And I run, I run, I run, further than before
I shake away the skin to saturate my, soul

You and I will not be shaken!
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

You and I will not be shaken!
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

And you scream, you scratch, you bite
You prey on my heart
And I know that you and I can never be a-part

You and I will not be shaken!
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter

You and I will not be shaken!
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound
