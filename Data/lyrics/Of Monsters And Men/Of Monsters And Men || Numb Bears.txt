
Fishing for a friend,
Can't remember when it was dark
Or the sun coming up.
Far across the ocean lone,
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there,
Never get there.

Breaking little twigs with my feet
And underneath
Is a road that's so steep.
Far across the ocean alone
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there
But I'm already there.
