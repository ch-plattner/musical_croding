It's hard letting go
I'm finally at peace but it feels wrong
Slow I'm getting up
My hands and feet are weaker than before

[Bridge]
And you are folded on the bed where I rest my head
There's nothing I can see, darkness becomes me

[Chorus]
But I'm already there, I'm already there
Wherever there is you, I will be there too

There's nothing that I'd take back
But it's hard to say there's nothing I regret
Cause when I sing, you shout
I breathe out loud
You bleed, we crawl like animals
But when it's over, I'm still awake

[Bridge]
A thousand silhouettes dancing on my chest
No matter where I sleep, you are haunting me

[Chorus]
But I'm already there, I'm already there
Wherever there is you, I will be there too
But I'm already there, I'm already there
Wherever there is you, I will be there too

'Cause I'm already there, I'm already there
Wherever there is you, I will be there too
I'm already there, I'm already there
Wherever there is you, I will be there too
