
I live the life above
Hold me down
Hold me down
I live the life of letting go
Under a starlit night
I wrap myself in thin sheet of ice
Up there, the stars are crystal lights

Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard
In the dark
Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard

'Cause you colour me clear,
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear,
Now what are you waitin' for?

See how my mountains turn
From blue to black
From white to gray
I'm burning, the broken one
The drops illuminate and evaporate into a neon lake
I'm a be stand the vicious one

Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard
In the dark
Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard

'Cause you colour me clear,
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear,
Now what are you waitin' for?
'Cause you colour me clear,
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear,
Now what are you waitin' for?
