
Feel the ocean as it breathes
Shivering teeth
See the mountains where they meet
Smothering me
As the wind fends off the waves
I count down the days
Heavy stones
Fear no weather

I find comfort in the sound
And the shape of the heart
How it echoes through the chest
From under the ground
As the hills turn into holes
I fill them with gold
Heavy stones
Fear no weather

And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate!
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two

And I paint your body black
I hide in your hair
And you're staring back at me
Like I wasn't there
As our bodies become stills
We welcome the fear
Heavy stones
Fear no weather

And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate!
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two

And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate!
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two
