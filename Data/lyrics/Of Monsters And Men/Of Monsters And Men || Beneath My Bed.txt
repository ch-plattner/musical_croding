
A lion's head beneath my bed
All these things that I once had
A tiger's paw that holds me down
Keeps me safe from what’s around
Keeps me safe from what’s around

A few years back I had the heart
Waiting for some things to start
Water running down my walls
Monsters on the second floor
Monsters on the second floor

There’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars, they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
But there’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars, they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
I am sure

A lion's head with eyes so red
All these things that I once had
A tiger's paw that holds me down
Presses hard this time around
Presses hard this time around

There’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars, they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
There’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars, they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
There’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
I am sure
I am sure

But there’s a fire, there’s a fire
But I know, I know
They are liars they are liars
But I am sure, I am sure
