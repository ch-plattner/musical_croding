
Cold, dark sea
Wrapping its arms around me
Pulling me down to the deep
All eyes on me

I push you away,
Although I wish you could stay
So many words left unsaid
But I'm all out of breath

So, go, go, go
Get out of here
Go away
Get out of here

Go, go
Get out of here
Go away
Get out of here

Go, go
Get out of here
Go away
Get out of here

Go, go
Get out of here
Go away

Cold, dark sea
Your waves are rocking me
I close my eyes and fall asleep
All eyes on me
Your eyes on me
