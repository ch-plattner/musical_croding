Blast on mirror tell or said
Blast in weapon wear it all away
Empty handed, empty handed

Pillow to rest a little in the soul
Bread or stone into would
Empty handed
Empty handed

Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule

Blast on mirror tell or said
Blast in weapon wear it all away
Empty handed, empty handed

Pillow to rest a little in the soul
Bread or stone into would
Empty handed, empty handed

Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
