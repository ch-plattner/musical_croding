
I'm called a cow
I'm not about to blow it now
for all the cows

it's funny how
money allows
all to browse
and be endowed
the wish is true
it falls into
places new
the cow is you

my kind has all run out
as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows
everything worn in like it's a friend

I said you're all a painted doll
and it caused
the walls to fall
how far is he?
impatiently
that's as far as could be
