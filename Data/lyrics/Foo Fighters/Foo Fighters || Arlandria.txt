Ain't that the way it always starts.
A simple round of conversation.
Became a shameful equation.
I flipped from station to station.

Hey. Don't go and turn the other way.
Don't say there's nothin more to say.
Come on, hear me out.
Hush, hush, settle down.
Button up, don't make a sound.
Shame, shame, go away.
Come again some other day.

You used to say I couldn't save you enough,
So I've been saving it up, I started saving it up.
And when you said I couldn't give you enough,
I started giving you up, I started giving you up.

You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria.
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God you gotta make it stop.

Chase all of those memories away,
Save them all for another day.
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you.

Wait!
I wanna see if you can shake.
I want to keep all I can take,
I feel much better now.
Use me up, spit me out,
Let me be your hand-me-down.
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day.

You used to say I couldn't save you enough,
So I've been saving it up, I started saving it up.

You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria.
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God you gotta make it stop.

My sweet Virginia, I'm the same as I was in your arms.
My sweet Virginia, I'm the same as I was in your heart.

Shame, shame go away,
Come again some other day.
Memories keep haunting me.
Help me chase them all away.
Hush, now settle down,
Button up, don't make a sound.
Close your eyes, turn around.
Help me burn this to the ground.
Come now, take the blame, that's okay, I'll play the game.
I don't care, it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames.
Use me up, spit me out,
Let me be your hand-me-down.
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day.

You used to say I couldn't save you enough,

My sweet Virginia, oh, God you gotta make it stop.
My sweet Virginia, oh, God you gotta make it stop.
