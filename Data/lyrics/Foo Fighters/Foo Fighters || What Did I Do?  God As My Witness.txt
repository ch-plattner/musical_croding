
There you go again,
putting words into my mouth.
This one's for you to know,
and for me to find out.

All that trouble, and you on about.
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud.
Stop, ask myself what did I do?
what did I do to deserve you?
Come on, tell me now what did I do?
what did I do to deserve you?

I heard every word comin' from the 13th floor.
Your song came along,
and I heard the voices telling me to save yourself,
I'll behave yourself.

I stop, ask myself what did I do?
what can I do to preserve you?
Come on, tell me now, what can I do?
What can I do to conserve you?

Your name, year of fame,
I could see the writing on the wall.
Come on, flip a coin, bet it's going to tell you
to save yourself, I'll behave yourself.

Your man, channelin', knowin' by the x on his hand
You raise, runaways singin' at the gate,
to save yourself, I'll behave yourself.

So here I go again,
putting words into your mouth.
This one's for me to know,
and for you to find out.

All that trouble and I'm on about,
how you gonna know, til you hear it out loud.
All of your heroes, where are they now?

I'm lost, deliver me,
I crossed the river finally.
God as my witness,
yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight.
God as my witness,
yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight.
God as my witness,
yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight.

God as my witness,
yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight.
God as my witness,
yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight.
