
Gas chamber
Where's the light?
Stay at home
Don't feel right

I'm in my room
All the time
Trapped inside
This twisted mind

Gas chamber
Cannot breathe
Time for lunch
Cannot leave

I'm in my room
All the time
I'm trapped inside
This freaking mind

No action, no, no
No action
Gas chamber
No, no action
