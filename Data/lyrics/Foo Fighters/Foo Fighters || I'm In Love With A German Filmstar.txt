
I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a bar
Sitting in a corner in imperfect clothes
Trying not to pose
For the cameras and the girls
It's a glamorous world

I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a movie
Playing the part of a real troublemaker
But I didn't care
It really moved me, it really moved me

I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a bar
Sitting in a corner in imperfect clothes
Trying not to pose
For the cameras and the girls
It's a glamorous world

I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a movie
Playing the part of a real troublemaker
But I didn't care
It really moved me, it really moved me
It really moved me, it really moved me

I'm in love [13x]
