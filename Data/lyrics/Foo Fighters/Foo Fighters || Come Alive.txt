
Seems like only yesterday
Life belong to runaways
Nothing here to see, no looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monocrome
Life begin to fade into the black
Such a simple animal
Steralized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore

Desperate, meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done

I lay there in the dark, I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Still I try to find my way
Spending hours, endin' days
Burning like a flame behind my eyes
Drown in out, drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, slave 'til in the skies
Disappeared the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering

Knew that it was time to say goodbye

I lay there in the dark and I close my eyes
You saved me the day that you came alive
The reason you left me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive

Come Alive [x33]

I lay there in the dark and I close my eyes
You saved me the day that you came alive

Come Alive [x15]

Nothing more to give
I can finally come alive
Your life into me
I can finally breathe
Come alive

I lay there in the dark
Open my eyes
You saved me the day that you came alive

Come Alive [x11]
