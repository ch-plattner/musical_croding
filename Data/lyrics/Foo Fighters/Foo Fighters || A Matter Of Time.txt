Let’s change the subject to someone else
You know lately I've been subject to change
Normally I reel in the strange
Hang over I’m older

You’re one to talk the heart is a clock
Just like a bomb that keeps on ticking away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army
Disarming me

It doesn’t matter much to me if it doesn’t matter much to you, ooh
It doesn’t matter much to me if it doesn’t matter much to you

It’s just a matter of time, before, before
It’s just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It’s just a matter of time

My past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for taking things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over and over

Doing my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I’m holding, still holding
Holding it well

It doesn’t matter much to me if it doesn’t matter much to you, ooh
It doesn’t matter much to me if it doesn’t matter much to you

It’s just a matter of time, before, before
It’s just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to remind, before, before
It’s just a matter of time

(where the hell were you, oooh)
(where the hell were you, oooh)
(where the hell were you)

It’s just a matter of time, before, before
It’s just a matter of time, before, before
And though I hate to revise, before, before
It’s just a matter of time

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
It’s just a matter of time
Time…
