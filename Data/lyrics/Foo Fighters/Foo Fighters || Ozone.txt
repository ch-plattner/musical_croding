
I'm the kind of
guy who likes feelin'
high Feelin' high and dry,
and I really like to fly
I'm your kinda guy, girl
I'm not too shy
And I want you to fly,
so I think you oughta try

Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone

I'm your kinda guy and
I'm not too shy
Feelin' high and
dry, and I want you to be mine
So I think it's time,
girl, to start feeling fine
Feeling good all the time,
so I think you oughta try

Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone

Now I'm the kinda guy who
likes getting high
Getting high and dry, and
I do it all the time
If you think it's a crime and
you don't wanna try
Something that'll make you high,
then I think I'll say goodbye

'Cos I'm the kind of guy who likes
getting high
Getting high and dry, and
I do it all the time
Now I'm much too high, I am
high and dry
And I'm feelin' fine, I'm feelin'
good all of the time... [to fade]
