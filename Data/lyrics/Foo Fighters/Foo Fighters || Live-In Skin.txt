There's a place I know,
There's a robbery, and I swear I'll never tell
If you swear you'll never tell, and
We'll all make out so well
We will all make out so well
Head on with my hate, into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted just the same old glitter story
From the sea floor, metamorphosis
And I can't change back for you
I will not change back for you
I must live in skin that's new
I'm a livid skin that's new
Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again, I'm amounted
