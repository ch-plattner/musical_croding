I have a choice between the bat or the belt
each time I hear about the hand you've been delt
spare me confession
it's confession you sell
maybe I'll fall behind
but I don't mind
because I'll catch up

I want a song that's indelible
like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up

will I be happy on the back of the shelf
will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
spare me your questions since you know me so well
someday you'll realize
that I get shy and I choke up

what is wrong with this animal
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

farewell my sweet paramania
my only promise is that I'll never tell
keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet
take the beating
until I take it back anyway
what was I supposed to say?
