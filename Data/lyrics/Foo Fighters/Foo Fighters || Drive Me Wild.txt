Ooh look at me in a Cadillac
You can play in a convertible child
I've never been driven baby you're the first
come on baby drive me wild, ooh

Ooh look at me on the telephone
whatever you want just dial
come on baby please it's so easy
do it baby drive me wild

come on baby do it drive me wild
do it baby drive me wild

Ooh look at me on the radio
call me up and make a request
If you want anything just name it
when I'm bad baby I'm the best

Ooh look at me on the big guitar
stick me up with a smile 
come on baby please it's so easy
do it baby drive me wild
