
Stupid on the Steinway
So sick upon a Steinway
The sailors drown

See them talk and see them drown
And see them drink and fall around
Upon the floor

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Lonely in a crowded room
The radio plays out of tune
So silently

The radio upon the floor
Is stupid it plays Aznavour
So out of key

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Broken on a ship of fools
Even dreams must fall to rules
So stupidly

Words are all just useless sound
Just like cards they fall around
And we will be

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Buy a car and watch it rust
Sister see them fall to dust
They fall around

In another crowded room
Paint me like the shirt I'm in
Honestly

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister.
