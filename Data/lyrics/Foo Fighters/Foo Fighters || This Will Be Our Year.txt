
The warmth of your love's
Like the warmth from the sun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

Don't let go of my hand
Now darkness has gone
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

I won't forget 
The way you helped me 
Up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said
Darling I love you
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there 
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

The warmth of your smile
Smile for me little one
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

You don't have to worry
All your worried days are gone
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget 
The way you helped me 
Up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said
Darling I love you
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there 
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

And we've only just begun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come
