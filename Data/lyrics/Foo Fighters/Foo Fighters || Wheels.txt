I know what you're thinkin' 
We were goin' down 
I can feel the sinkin' 
But then I came around 

And everyone I've loved before 
Flashed before my eyes 
And nothin' mattered anymore 
I looked into the sky 

Well I wanted something better man 
I wished for something new 
And I wanted something beautiful 
And wish for something true 
Been lookin' for a reason man 
Something to lose 

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground) 
And you feel like it's all over 
There's another round for you 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 

Know your head is spinnin' 
Broken hearts will mend 
This is our beginning 
Comin to an end 

Well, you wanted something better man 
You wished for something new 
Well, you wanted something beautiful 
Wished for something true 
Been lookin for a reason man 
Something to lose 

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground) 
And you feel like it's all over 
There's another round for you 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground) 
And you feel like it's all over 
There's another round for you 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down) 
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground) 
And you feel like it's all over 
There's another round for you 
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
