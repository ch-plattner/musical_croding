Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud
Things just won't do without you
Matter of fact
Ooo...
I'm on your back [2x]
Ooo...
I'm on your back

If you'd accept surrender
I'll give up some more
Weren't you adored
I cannot be without you
Matter of fact
Ooo...
I'm on your back

If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you [2x]

Another heart cracked
In two
I'm on your back...
