
It was meant to be
But all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by
Did you see me when your life flashed before your eyes?
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough,
Hard enough for you?

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
There's a world out there

Elementary
I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when
Tell me off again
I will let you know
When I've had enough

Had enough of you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)

I know you've got your reasons
Hey let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head

There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)
