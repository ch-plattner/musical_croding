Winding your way down on Baker Street 
Light in your head and dead on your feet 
Another crazy day 
You drink the night away 
And forget about everything 
This city's dance makes you feel so cold 
It's got so many people but it's got no soul 
And it's taken you so long 
To find out you were wrong 
When you thought it held everything 

Used to think that it was so easy 
Used to say that it was so easy 
But you're trying, you're trying now 

Another year and then you'll be happy 
Just one more year and then you'll be happy 
But you're crying, you're crying now 

Way down the street there's a light in his place 
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face 
And he asks where you've been 
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything 
He's got this dream about buying some land 
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands 
And then he'll settle down 
In this quiet little town 
And forget about everything 

But you know he'll always keep moving 
You know, he's never gonna stop moving 
'Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stone 

When you wake up, it's a new morning 
The sun is shining, it's a new morning 
You're going, you're going home
