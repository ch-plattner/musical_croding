
Took the high dive into your brain
And you made your lonely calls
You just might wear your welcome out
If you don’t let it go
There’s nothing that you couldn’t say
Cuz you’ve said it all before
I think it’s time you walked this lonely road
all on your own
It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
I wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head Like no one
else Are you looking for someone to blame?
Did you blame me all along?
You’ll take the heat
But you would never take the fall

It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

You’re so afraid that you are the only one
You are the only one
You know

Don’t be afraid cuz you’re not the only one
You’re not the only one
I know
