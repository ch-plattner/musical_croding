
When all is said and done
In the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these broken wings floating
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

On into the sun
On into the sun

Looking down at you
Sleeping from above, I love
Looking down at you
Weeping from above, I love

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns

And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

When all is dead and gone
In the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these dying arms, see them
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

Heaven skies are reeling
And the hand that holds the world
Deep inside I'm reaching
Into the universe

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns

And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns

And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
