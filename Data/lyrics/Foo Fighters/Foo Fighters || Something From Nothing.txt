
Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match 
Ready to strike
So here I go...

Here lies a city on fire
Singing along
The arsonist choir
Now here I go...

It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now here I go...

There is a river I found
Into the wild
Under the ground
So here I go...

A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go...

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go...

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word I took your wine 
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now ain't that something
Fuck it all! I came from nothing

I'm something 
From nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something 
From nothing
You are my fuse
It goes...

Oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh...
It goes...
Oh oh oh...

All Rise!

No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now ain't that something
Fuck it all! I came from nothing
I'm something 
From nothing
I'm something 
From nothing
