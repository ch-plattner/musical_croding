
Seda can you hear me
Do you know my face
Perfect like a circle
Gone without a trace

So long I have known you
Marks upon your skin
I can picture everything
Can you picture this

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All the secrets bare for the world to see

Who will stand before you
If you don't say my name
Safe to say we will never know
We are both the same

I don't mind
I can always find you
Waiting there for me

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All her secrets bare for the world to see

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
Seda doesn't care
She's just dyin' there
Seda doesn't care
She's just lyin' there
All the secrets bare for you and me
