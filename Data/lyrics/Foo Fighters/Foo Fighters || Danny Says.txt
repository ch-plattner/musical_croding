Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfin'
'cause it's 20 below.
Sound check's at 5:02.
Record stores and interviews.
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow.

Baby
Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go and it may sound Funny,
But's true.
Hangin' out in 100 B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinkin' about You and me
And you and me.

Hangin' out in L.A.
And there's nowhere to go.
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow.
Listening to Sheena on the radio.
Oh-ho oh-ho.
