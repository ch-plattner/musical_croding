
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need?
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down [2x]

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide
On and on I've got nothing to hide

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down [2x]

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, when it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one [8x]

[Yelling:]
Done, done, on to the next one
Done I'm done and I'm on to the next one [2x]

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down [2x]

[Yelling]
Done, done and on to the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm
On to the next.
