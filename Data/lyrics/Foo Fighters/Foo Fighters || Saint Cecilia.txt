
There ain't no secrets anymore
My name's been hanging on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

You're out of sight, I'm out of mind
Been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
Just a game of mine

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by
[x2]

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by
[x4]
