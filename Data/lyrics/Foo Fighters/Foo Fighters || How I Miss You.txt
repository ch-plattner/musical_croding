How I miss you
How I miss you
How I miss you
I should never call
How I hope that you still miss me

Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide & seeks alright if I find

Do you miss me
Like I miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully, you'll come stay someday

If you're leaving,
come back soon
Thats not easy to say

I'll wait here,
dream of you
all alone as I ache
