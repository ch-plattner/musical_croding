
Lately I'm getting better
Wish I could stay sick with you
But there's too many egos left to bruise
Call it sin, you can call it whatever,
Eating deep inside of you
Well if it were me it's all I'd ever do
Steal me now and forever
I'll steal something good for you
The criminal in me is no one new
Till you find something better
When there's nothing left to use
And everything starts going down on you
I'm the Generator, firing whenever you quit
Yeah whatever it is, you go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it
Send me out on a tether
Swing it round I'll spin your noose
You let it down
I'll hang around with you, till you find someone better
When there's no one left to use, and everyone keeps going down
