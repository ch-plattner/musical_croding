This is the sound
The here and the now
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk
To get it all out

I listen
I listen
I listen

But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

Something I've found
Yea, That want to turn around
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk
To make any ground

You're pushing
You're pushing
You're pushing

But there ain't no room
No there ain't no room

This is The last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm trough
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never name again
I will never name again

We pretend it doesn't matter
We pretend it all away
We pretend it all away

We pretend
We pretend
We pretend

But it ain't no use
This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm through

This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you
To you
To you
To you
