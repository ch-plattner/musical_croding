
This state I'm in
A place I've never been
I'm dying to meet you here

Come break this skin
I'll let you sink right in
And show you everything
See you in hell
See you in hell

We'll gather around the fire
And I will lead the choir
Sing Farewell
See you in hell

Come break, my spell
Well down the wishing well
We'll find some time to time to kill

I'll be, right there
The buzz inside your head
The whole electric chair
See you in hell

We'll gather round the fire
And I don't need the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell
