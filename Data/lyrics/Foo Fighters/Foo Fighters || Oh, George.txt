the train that I got onto up and left that town
threw it up as it went down
strange enough it left me rude and turned around
watched as they all took their vows

fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway
phase it out until the older ones return
have a seat and watch it burn
trace around the corner this is what I've learned
always waited for my turn
