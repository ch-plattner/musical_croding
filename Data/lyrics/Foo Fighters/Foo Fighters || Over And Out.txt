Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms

Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon

Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Over and out

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
