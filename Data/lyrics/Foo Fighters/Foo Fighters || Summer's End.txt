
Early morning without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the sun was dead

Make me warm or take me home
Its so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Golden lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end.

Come on over brave my storm
Oceans overhead
Come inside, my friend
Getting bad out there

Every moment we have stolen
All we have to share

No one wanted them
But you know I did
You know I did
This moment

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Meet me in the summertime
I will meet you there
