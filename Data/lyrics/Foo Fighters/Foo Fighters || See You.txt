These notes are marked return to sender
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you
See you, see you

These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm getting further from myself
One thing is always true
How good it is to see you
See you, to see you

Uuuh
Uh uuh uh uuh uh uh uh
Uh uuh uh uuh uh uh uh

I'm done resenting you
You represented me so well
And this I promise you
How could I end up in the hands of someone else?
