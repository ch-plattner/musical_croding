
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah!

Beautiful prisoner, left here for dead
Promises made and sentences read
Voices and visions are locked in my head
I could sing for sorrow
All of the words that we damn never speak
All of our ghosts and secrets do keep
Gather them all we'll bury them deep
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, hey!

One for forever
One in your name
Once in your member
We're one in the same
One to forget but it always remains
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, yeah!
