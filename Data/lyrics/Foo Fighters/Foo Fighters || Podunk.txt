Power is as sacred to that they never even teach
Only if it's black or white see the challenges
Open eyes are broken if you'd just consider me
Cut you loose, I feel like I gotta gotta go!

Find an answer help yourself
Find an answer help yourself

Whatever kind of phony body chewed it through the night
Soda is left to block away the case of broken heart
Spit out fast for fun for it's the only way to win
Take my breathe come back inside, oh I gotta gotta go!

I got the answer help yourself
Find any answer help yourself
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself
