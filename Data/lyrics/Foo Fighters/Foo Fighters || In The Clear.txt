
There are days I might not make it
There are days i might start breakin’
But when the rains starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spirits
It’s in the square
God damn I swear

There are times I feel like givin' in
There are times I begin to begin again
Look outside the world keeps spinning like a paddle-wheel
Rolling for the broken-hearted waiting on the heal

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
In the clear

There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember
How could I forget you painted stars into the sky?
Coming like a rebirth marching in a second line

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
In the clear

And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out!

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don’t you go count me out now, dear
In the clear

In the clear
