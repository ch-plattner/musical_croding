You're my size I need to try you on
Someone in between the right and wrong
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Through everything you stayed the same
And when I've had enough

She drains me
When I'm empty
She helps herself
She takes it all
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
Don't wanna have it all

Running through this maze you hold me in
Searching in a daze to find the out
Through everything you left your wings apart
I'm everything I'm anyone you want
And when I've had enough

She drains me
When I'm empty
She helps herself
She takes it all
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
Don't wanna have it all

I'm everything you're everything I'm not
I'm anything I'm anyone you want

She drains me
When I'm empty
She helps herself
She takes it all
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
