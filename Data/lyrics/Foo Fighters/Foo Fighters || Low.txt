Are you in there 
I'm stuck outside you, ooh 

We could use 
One another 
Another like you, ooh 

You be my passerby 
I'll be your one to pass through 
Screws inside 
Turn so tight 
Turning on you 
I'm hanging on you, ooh 

Me and you 
Going nowhere 
I'm right beside you, ooh 

Me and you 
Going nowhere 
I'm right beside you, ooh 

You be my passerby 
I'll be your one to pass through 
Screws inside 
Turn so tight 
Turning on you 
I'm hanging on you 

Taking you as low as you go 
As low as you go 
Taking you as low as you go 
As low as you go 

Ooh, ooh, ooh 

You be my passerby 
I'll be your one to pass through 
Screws inside 
Turn so tight 
Turning on you 
I'm hanging on you 

Taking you as low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
As low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
Taking you as low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
As low as you go 
(Low as you go) 

As low as you go 
Low as you go 

Ooh, ooh 

Taking you as low as you go 
As low as you go 
Taking you as low as you go 
As low as you go 

Taking you as low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
As low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
Taking you as low as you go 
(Low as you go) 
As low as you go 
(Low as you go)
