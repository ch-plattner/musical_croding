You make me dizzy running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down

Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out, better get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout

You can see this on my face
It's all for you
The more and more I take
I break right through

Therapy still scares me
Put me on my back again

I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out

Burning in the blast-off, burning in the blast-off
watching me crawl away
Try to get out, try to get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

Breakout!
Breakout!
Breakout! 
Breakout!
Go, go, go!

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
Make me breakout

Yeah!
