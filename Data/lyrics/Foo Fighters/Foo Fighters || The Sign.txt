
I got superstition
Ruling my decision
You are my religion
Haven't got a Prayer

So just give me the sign and I'll follow you
When every angel's guarding you
You are my religion
Haven't got a prayer

I don't want to wait to save your life
I think I know a way to make things right

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, maybe
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me

Walking under ladders
Nothing really matters
There could be disaster
I don't really care

So just give me the sign and I'll follow you
When every angel's guarding you
There could be disaster
I don't really care

I don't want to wait to save your life
I think I know a way to make things right

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, maybe
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out

For me [x2]

I don't want to wait to save your life
I think I know a way to make things right

Just give me the sign
Give me the sign
Give me the sign
Just give me the sign

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, maybe
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me (give me the sign)

Give me the sign [x3]
