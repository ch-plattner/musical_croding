I've been cheating gravity and waiting on the falls
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown 

Choke! On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head, into the clear 
When you go I come loose 

These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Choke! On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head, into the clear 
When you go I come loose 

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some hope I'm coming through, I'm counting on you
Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head, into the clear 
When you go I come... 
Loose
