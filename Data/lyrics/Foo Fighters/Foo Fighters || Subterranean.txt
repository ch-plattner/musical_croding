Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean

But the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky
Yet the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky

You might think you know me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

You might think you own me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Buried my heart, cannot go this alone
And I might think you love me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, you don't

Bring all your lies leave them deep in the dirt
Oh no, you don't
Pull down my eyes
Lay me deep in the earth
