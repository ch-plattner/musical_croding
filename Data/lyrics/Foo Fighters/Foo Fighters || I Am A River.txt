
There is a secret
I found a secret
Behind a Soho door

There is a reason
I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor

I found the water
The devils water
and walked along its shore

Is that what you want?

The channelâ€™s changing
The heart is racing
from voices on a wire

The soul is yearning
the cold is burning
the ember starts a fire

Can we recover
love for each other,
the measure of your life

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want

A river
A river
a river running under ground

A river
A river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x4]

Is that what you want
is that what you really want

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x4]

I am a river!

I!.. I!..
I am a river
[x3]
