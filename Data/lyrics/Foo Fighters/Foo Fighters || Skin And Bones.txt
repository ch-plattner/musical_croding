Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin
Watch me spin

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones

All worn out and nothing fits
Brennevin and cigarettes
The more I give the less I get
But I'm all set
I'm all set

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones [x5]

Deep within this frame of mind
Heart of hearts, oh Valentine
Tell my mom I'm doing fine
Doing fine
Doing fine

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones [x4]

I'm just skin and hey!
