
they knew all along
they're not dumb, they were so wrong
she's not always fun
hate it now, call when I'm done

pieces fell in place
puzzles suck, laughing in my face
turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist

head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

crazy t.v. dreams might be true
not what it seems
food and cavitys, chewing words
tear at the seams
he don't feel so good, don't feel bad
not that I should

did you ever listen? get out
