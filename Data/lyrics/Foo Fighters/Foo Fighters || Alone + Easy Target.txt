
They knew all along
They're not dumb
They were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now
Call when I'm done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck
Laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this
Keep the good waist

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target

Crazy T.V. dreams
Might be true
Not what it seems
Food and cavities
Chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good
Don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good
Don't feel bad
Not that I should

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target

Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?

Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out

Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone, and I'm an easy target

Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?

Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out
