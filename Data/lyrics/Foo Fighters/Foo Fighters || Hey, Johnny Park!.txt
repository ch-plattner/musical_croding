
come and I'll take you under
this beautiful bruise's colors
everything fades in time it's true
wish that I had another
stab at the undercover
was it a change in mind for you

it's impossible
I can't let it out
you'll never know
am I selling you out
sit and watch
your every mood

your eyes still remind me of
angels that hover above
eyes that can change from blind to blue

now that I've found my reward
I'd throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mine with you
