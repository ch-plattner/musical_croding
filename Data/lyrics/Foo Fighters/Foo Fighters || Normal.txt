
The waves that silences break come again, one by one
I lay awake and I count till I drown
Turn up the room it's getting too loud
I know I don't have to say it
Pick up and move and go find some new ground
Somewhere I know I can make it

But I won't give up when I want it enough
No I won't give up
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
Cause I figured it out
Here and the now takes me day by day

Will you come out tonight
Will you back down, will you put up a fight
Turn me around and make everything right
Make me normal from now on

Erased everyone I've replaced
In the end they're all gone
The faces all fade as the time passes by
What could I do I was waiting for you
Grown sick and tired of faking
Give me those eyes when I give you the truth
Finally here for the taking

But I won't give up
When I want it enough
No I won't give up
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
Cause I figured it out
Here and the now takes me day by day

Will you come out tonight
Will you back down, will you put up a fight
Turn me around and make everything right
Make me normal from now on

Hey will you come out tonight
Will you back down, will you put up a fight
Turn me around and make everything right
Make me normal from now on

I've figured it out here and the now
Takes me day by day
