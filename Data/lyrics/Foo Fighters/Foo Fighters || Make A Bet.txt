I'm hanging around
I'm not putting down the state i'm in
I've never been proud
And now I'm allowed to shed my skin

I'm driving away
I know if I stay, I'll sit and spin
Imagine the day
I'm drowning at bay, so reel me in

Pick up where I left off

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose with you

I see it all now
I'm taking my bow and everything
I'm scratching around
It's getting too loud, the space I'm in

So now I can leave
10 pieces at least, some evidence
The one that relieves
The other's disease like minicyn

Pick up where I left off

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose

Speaking in tongues
I can't get through
Thinking of running but
I'm tired of running into you

Speaking in tongues, the way I do
I've found that you understand quite well
Cause that's your language too

I'm hanging around
I'm not putting down the state I'm in
In love with the sound
It's getting too loud.

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose

Let's make a bet
I never wanted to call this truce
Let's make a bet
All is lost and win or lose with you
