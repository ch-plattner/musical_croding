
Oh, Oh
If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing
Never had much to choose

Then it dawned on me
Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon

Been waiting all your life, your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating, me right out of you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again

Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Get in and let's go, go

What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me, but
Sure would look good on you

Waiting all your life, your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating, me right out of you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again

Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Get in and let's go, go!

Miss the misery
Gimme reason for a change
Miss the misery
Gimme reason to refrain

Miss your misery today!
Miss your misery today!
Come on and turn it on for me!

Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Don't make this right
Don't make this right
Get in and let's go
Go, oh, oh, oh
