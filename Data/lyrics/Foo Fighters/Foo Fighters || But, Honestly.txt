
Where are you off to with that head of yours?
Is there somewhere you should be?
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
and told you it's not you it's only me?

Maybe

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my peace of mind)
Don't say what I don't need
(Give my back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
You'll see

What you up to now your mirror's gone?
Is there someone you should be?
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you?

But honestly
But honestly
But honestly

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my peace of mind)
Don't say what I don't need
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
(Give me back my peace and quiet)
Nowhere to hide from me
You'll see

And tonight I thank the stars
As I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me

And all the wants I gave to you
Something borrowed, something blue
If you want them back
I'll give it to you

Give it to you [15x]

I don't want one thing that I gave to you. [8x]
