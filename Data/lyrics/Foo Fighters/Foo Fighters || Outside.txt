
There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling, blessed in Kashmir
All your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Finding glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

All I found, the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me
