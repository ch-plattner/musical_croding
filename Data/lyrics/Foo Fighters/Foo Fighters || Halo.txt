
Good and bad 
I swear I've had them both, they're overrated 
But is it fun 
When you get hold of one 
Some gone bad 
And some gone back 
Good ones all get taken 
I'm callin' your bluff
You ain't strong enough 

Wait and pray you'll pick on me the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been blessed but I'll be damned

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Say your prayers when you get scared 
Pray you're gonna make it 
And then when you're done 
You keep fucking up 

One day soon I'll disappear 
And if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go 
To keep from growing old 

Wait and pray you'll pick on me the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been blessed but I'll be damned

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Oh, oh, oh 

Disappear, the light is fading 
Disappear, outside their rage 
Disappear, I'm tired of waiting 
Disappear before we get away... 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Oh, oh, oh
