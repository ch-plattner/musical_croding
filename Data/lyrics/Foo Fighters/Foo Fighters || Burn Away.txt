
I have spent a lifetime 
Waiting for the chance 
To save you my confession 
Save the one last dance 

The same old superstition 
Haunt us now and then 
I'm begging for ignition 
To start it all again 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

Breathe for me from now on 
Breathe for me when I'm gone 
Burn out beyond 
Out beyond the sun 

Will you still remember 
There behind the skies 
Walking on the embers 
Standing in their light 

The hardest part is knowing 
Everything must die 
The hardest part is waiting here 
Waiting to collide 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight 

We'll burn away 
Burn away, burn away my pride 

Breathe for me from now on 
Breathe for me when I'm gone 
Burn out beyond 
Out beyond the sun 

Burn on, burn on 
Calling to you 
Burn on, burn on 
Calling to you 
Burn on, burn on... 

I'll never burn again 
Never burn again [x3]
We'll never burn again 
Never burn again [x3]
