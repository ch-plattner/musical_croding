I thought I knew
all it took to bother you
every word I said was true
and that you'll see

how could it be
I'm the only one who sees
your rehearsed insanity

I still refused
all the methods you abused
it's alright if you're confused
let me be

I've been around
all the pawns you've gagged and bound
they'll come back and knock you down
and I'll be free

I've taken all and I've endured
one day this all will fade I'm sure

I don't owe you anything [x4]

I had no hand
in your ever desperate plan
it returns and when it lands
words are due

I should've known
we were better off alone
I looked and I was shown
you were too

I've taken all and I've endured
one day this all will fade I'm sure

I don't owe you anything [x8]

I'll stick around [x2]

and learn from all that came from it
