Dear lover
Do you remember?
The sound of your laughter and demise
And that was all
I need to fall in love

This matter
It's something bigger
Anything ever graced my heart
And that was all
I could fall in love...with you
And I can't stall this now

Did you find some happiness with me?
Now I know the way true love should be

Dear lover
Do you remember?
The beats of my heart that I gave you
And that was all
I need to fall in love

It shattered
Slipped through my fingers
Floated down safely into your hands
And that was all
I could fall in love...with you
I can't stall this now

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh

Did you find some happiness with me?

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
