Here now don't make a sound
Say have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singing in your name

Maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Dear God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates
I know one wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Oh, God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay?
Running through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight
