Every night my dream's the same
Same old city with a different name
They're not coming to take me away!
I don't know why, but I know I can't stay
Yeah

There's a weight that's pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know when

It's coming
When it's coming

There's a weight that's pressing me down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know when

It's coming
Or when
But it's coming, keep the car running

There's this fear I keep so deep
Knew it's name since before I can speak, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

They know my name I know them
Can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name but I don't understand
But they don't know where, they don't know when

It's coming
Or when
Keeps me coming, keep the car running

Keep the car running

Keep the car running
