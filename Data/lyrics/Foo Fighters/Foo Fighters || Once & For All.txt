
Oh misery come usher me in
No better place for me to begin
I'm coming in from out of this rain
The time has come to wash you away

The lovers are at it again
The lovers are at it again
Oh gather round sing your sins, amen
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war

Oh bring to me your broken and blue
No matter if it matters to you
A longing like never before
I've had enough now i need more

The lovers are at it again
The lovers are at it again
Oh gather round sing your sins, amen
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war
My time has come once and for all
My time has come this means war

Hey, forgive me debility
I'll sing you all my sins

My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war

My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war

The lovers are at it again
The lovers are at it again
The lovers are at it again
The lovers are at it again
