
Have you been headwired
Were you satisfied
Did it free the feelings in your spine
Sleeping way inside all this time
Will you meet your mind where the night collides
Will you greet yourself when the sun arrives
I'll just stay behing, I've met mine
Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now
Help you feed the wires when your head unwinds
And if our headlines become entwined
You can have all mine, I'll be fine
There's a reason why keeping me alive
There's a cure in me that I wish were mine
As long as I can fight, I'll survive
Stationed on the wire, one day I'll let go
Tell them all hell
The sun is on
Arlandria, headwire
