
Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside for ever
Never seeing no one, nice again,
Like you, mama
You, mama... you...

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away.
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
(If I ever get out of here)

Well the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
I hope you're having fun.

Band on the run; band on the run
And the jailer man, and sailor Sam,
Were searching everyone
For the Band on the run...
Band on the run [x3]

Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And the bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run,

Band on the run; band on the run
And the jailer man, and sailor Sam,
Were searching everyone
For the Band on the run...
Band on the run [x3]

Band on the run [x4]
Well the night was failing
As the desert world began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But the never will be found

Band on the run; band on the run
And the country judge, who held a grudge
Will search for ever more.
For the Band on the run 
Band on the run [x7]
