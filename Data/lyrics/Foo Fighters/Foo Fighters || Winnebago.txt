
Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Feed the lawn from the palms of their hands

Never holding, to a pole
Winnebago, we were one
Hold in wonder, spoke and wheel
She divorces, party zeal

Daddy loves little son, no demand

Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Crawl along, lookin'up 'til you stand
