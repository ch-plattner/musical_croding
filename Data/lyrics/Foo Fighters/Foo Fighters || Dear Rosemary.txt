
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me

I couldn't grow just living in the shadow
Where do you go when no one's following you?
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

Shall I go on and on and on and on and on and on again?

Rosemary, you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary

You got away, got away, got away with things
You got away, got away, got away with things

False starts, young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces coming down around you
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

Can I go on and on and on and on and on and on again?

Rosemary, you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

This was no ordinary life (This was no ordinary life)
This was no ordinary life (This was no ordinary life)

I'm here from now on
but once I'm gone
I'm gone

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
You're part of me (You're part of me)
Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
Please pardon me (Please pardon me)

You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
