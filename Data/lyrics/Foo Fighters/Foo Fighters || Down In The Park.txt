
Down in the park where the machmen meet
The machine and play kill by numbers
Down in the park with a francophile
I was in a car crash or was it the war
But I never been quite the same
Little white lies like I was there

Come to tom-tom's the place to be
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans trying to run
Oh look, there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way
Wouldn't believe the things they do

Down in the park
Where the chant is death, death, death
Til' sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
We are not lovers, we are not romantics
We are here to serve
Different face but the words never change
