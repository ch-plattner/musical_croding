Give me loud to drown it out, before the world starts waking up
You change and then
You change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Hurry now we're drifting out this silence keeps on sinking us
Come on down we'll take this town tonight before it turns to dust

You change and then
You change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Keep hanging by a thread

Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death

There's a lie I think you'll find it's locked inside of everyone
You and I get on with life and pray we'll find a better one

You change and then
You change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Keep hanging
Keep hanging by a thread

(Here we go)
You change and then
You change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Help me now I'm running out this time I think I'm breaking up
Come on down we'll take this town tonight before it turns to dust
I change and then
I change again
Turning like a wheel inside my head

Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Keep hanging by a thread

Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Overdrive I'm going life or death
Keep hanging
Keep hanging
Keep hanging
Keep hanging
