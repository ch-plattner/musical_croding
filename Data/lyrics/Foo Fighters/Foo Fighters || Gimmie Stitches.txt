
I can be your right of way
So we can get out of here
I'll always be the one who runs from everyone
Cause everyone's just too weird
Sink with someone tied to me
I'm making you volunteer
Another one has come and gone
They crawl along, make them disappear
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Dying to get my blood on you
Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal I waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone
They crawl along, wasting all these years
How can you go on when you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do
Gimmie stitches now or never
Before I get my blood on you
