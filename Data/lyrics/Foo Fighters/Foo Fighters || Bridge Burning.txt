These are my famous last words!
My number's up, bridges well, burned

Oh, won't you let me twist your faith
It's getting kinda late but I don't wanna wait no more
Oh may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace
Passed your test of faith

Another time another place
Another line upon your face
Another in your way

Down crooked stairs and sideways glances
Comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flame

Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

Your bridges are burning down
They're all coming down
It's all coming round
You're burning them down
It's all coming round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Oh let me put you in your place
I love it when you say
Giving everything away

Tell now what's in it for me
Tell me now what's in it for me
No one's getting this for free
Tell me now what's in it for me

Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

Your bridges are burning down
They're all coming down
It's all coming round
You're burning them down
It's all coming round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning down

Gather in the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gather in the ashes
Scatter as they blow away
Gather in the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gather in the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Your bridges are burning down
They're all coming down
It's all coming round
You're burning them down
It's all coming round
They're all coming down
They're all coming down

Gather in the ashes (Your bridges are burning down)
Everything thrown away (They're all coming down)
Gather in the ashes(It's all coming round)
Scatter as they blow away

Gather in the ashes (You're burning them down)
Everything thrown away (Its all coming round)
Gather in the ashes (They're all coming round)
Scatter as they blow away
Your bridges are burning down.
