You know a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days

You know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people they'd step back
When a young man walked by

But you know nowadays
It's the old man,
He's got all the money
And a young man 
And a young man
And a young man
And a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days
