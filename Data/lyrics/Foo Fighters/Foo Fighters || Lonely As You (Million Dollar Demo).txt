
Yeah!
Wake up you're dreaming
I can't stand your screaming
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meaning
Spare all the preaching there's secrets I'm keeping
No-one understands like I do
Keep out of reach I will keep in the deep-end
Hide behind these hands though I still see right through them
Every now and then you're down and out my friend 
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm done for you

Is anyone out there?

What can I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose
What can I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose

Blame it on youth all those years I punch through them
Blame it on the past it's the last place I threw them
Blame all the children they're raging and ruin
Blame it on the black and blue
And so in the end
You're down and out my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm done for you

Is anyone out there?

What can I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose
What can I do?
Lonely as you
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm done for you

Is anyone out there now?
Is anyone out there now?
Is anyone out there now?
Is anyone out there now?
Is anyone out there now? (One more time for the last time)
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe
One more time for the last time
One more time for relief
One more time for the very last time, everyone wants to believe
Alright

What can I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose
What can I do?
Lonely as you
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again but I'm done with you

Is anyone out there now?
