
Dearest constellation, heaven surroundin' you
Stay there, soft and blue. Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two
Feelin' like I do, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
Hear me callin' you, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
