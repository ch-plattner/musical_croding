
Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shining once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

Everytime I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun
I can be your trouble
Shiver into you
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black

When it comes closing in
Reject
Cause I gotta move
And the simple things get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black
