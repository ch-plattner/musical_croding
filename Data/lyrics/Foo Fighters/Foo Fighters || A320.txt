There is a place I'd love to go
Strangers takin' me there
I dream about the day I learn to fly

I'm afraid of aeroplanes
Even though I like the way
It feels to be a person in the sky

It's alright
And it's good
This time

I look out and on the ground
Really don't believe it
Gravity can pull me from this height

One day we'll come crashing down
What will I do
Never had a chance to say goodbye

Close my eyes and hope that it's
A real smooth flight
This time
Close my eyes and hope that it's
A real smooth flight

And it's good
This time

I look down and on the ground
I look down and on the ground
I look down and on the ground
I look out, we're going down
