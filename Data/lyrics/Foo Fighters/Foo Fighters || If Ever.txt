
If ever you think you're not the one, i'll remind you.
If ever you think you're about to run, i will find you.
Come on to me, just let it go.
If ever you think you're not the one, i'll remind you.

Come on my love
Come on my love

If ever you think i'm not the one, i'll remind you.
With everything under the sun, stars above you.
Come on to me, just let it go.
If ever you think i'm not the one, i'll remind you.

Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love

Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love

If ever you think you're not the one, i'll remind you.
If ever you think you're not the one.
