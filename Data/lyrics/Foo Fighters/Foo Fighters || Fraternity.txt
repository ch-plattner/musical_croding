
I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I'll never be fraternity
I'll never need that brand of me
Fading the pace behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch you rise
Go on keep feeding

swearing by the
swearing father
swearing father

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I don't believe fraternities
See the disease fraternities
Wait of the hate behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch your rise
Go on keep feeding

swearing by them
swearing father
swearing father

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Hand me down

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Bored in life
Bored in life
