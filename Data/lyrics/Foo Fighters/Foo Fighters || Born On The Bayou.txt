Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee
My Poppa said, son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me
'Cause he'll get you, 'cause he'll get you now, now.

I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the backwoods bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there, 
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou.

Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen.
Wishin' I were a fast freight train, oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans.

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou.

I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the river bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there, 
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou.
