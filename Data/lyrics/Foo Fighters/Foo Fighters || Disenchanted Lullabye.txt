Sing me yours, I'll sing you mine
Sing with me now what's a boy to do?
What's a boy to do?

Sing along for yesterday
Sing along my soul today
Sing along another song for you
What's a boy to do?

Chorus:
I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter
No one has a fit like I do

I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter?
No one has a fit like I do
I'm the only one that's fits you

Whispering to pass the time
Whisper for the days gone by
Whisper with the voice inside of you

With this ring you will be mine
With this ring I'll multiply
With this ring surrendering to you
What's a boy to do?
