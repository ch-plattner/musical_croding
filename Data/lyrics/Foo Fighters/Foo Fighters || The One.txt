Everyone makes one mistake
One more time for old times sake
One more time before the feeling fades

One that’s born of memories
One more bruise you gave to me
One more test just how much can I take

Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Something never meant to be
Everything you meant to me
Wake me when this punishment is done

Those who try and get away
>From the one who gets away
Someone’s always someone else’s one

Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit
You’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Until the end of time
In another life
Until the day I die
Save it up for one more try
Save it for the last goodbye
We go on and get off
And get on and get off

Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit
You’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You’re not the one but you’re the only one 
Who can make me feel like
Ohhhhhhhhh shit
