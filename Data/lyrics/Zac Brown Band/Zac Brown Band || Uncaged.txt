
Gonna lift to the great wide open
Wanna set my spirit free
Won't stop till I reach the ocean
Gonna break these chains holding me
Uncaged

Gonna swim in the coldest river
Gonna drink from a mountain spring
Deep in the land of the great wide open
Let the water roll all over me
Uncaged

Oh, wanna swim in the sunshine
And every day find a way to face my fears
Oh, wanna get in the wind

Gonna take every chance I'm given
Feel the wind through the open plains
Freedom is a gift, get livin
Go chase that sunset highway down
You got to get uncaged!
