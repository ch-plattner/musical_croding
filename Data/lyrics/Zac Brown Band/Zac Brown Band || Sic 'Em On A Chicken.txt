Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly 

Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken.
Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry. 

My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard 
He's a mean son' bitch 
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar 

Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly 

Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry. 

I heard this awful noise coming from the woods 
I heard chicken screams 
Know it ain't gonna be good 

Well I think we lost the chicken 
Think we lost the chicken 
Think we lost the chicken because I just heard him cry 

Think we lost the chicken 
Think we lost the chicken 
Think we lost the chicken but you can get another one for a dollar 79 

In a couple of years his spurs have grown 
He wasn't safe to keep around the house 
When he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son 
And I was sitting at home making fig preserves 
And I'd seen where that rooster kicked him in the eye 
And I knew that that was the day that chicken was going to get what he deserved 

So I chased the chicken 
I chased the chicken 
I chased the chicken and Pete hit 'em from the side 

I chased the chicken 
I chased the chicken 
I chased the chicken and me and Pete suppered on a home made chicken pot pie 

Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly 

Sic 'em on a chicken 
Get that chicken 
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time
