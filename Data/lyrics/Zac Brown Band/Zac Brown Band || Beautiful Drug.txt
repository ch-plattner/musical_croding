I got a death wish
Her looks can kill
She's got a red dress
Lipstick and heels
Pull me in, get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high

You're such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me

She lets her hair down
And all of mine stand up
Can't help but stare now
Gotta feel that touch
Her kiss, my fix, so sweet
Can't quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I'm never getting sober
I can tell that the effects are taking over
Pull me in, get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high

You're such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me
Tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
I'm addicted and dying for a hit of your love
I'm losing it, baby
Keep driving me crazy, crazy

Going out of my mind
Staring at you
Burning up in your fire that I've fallen into
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me
Tonight

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
