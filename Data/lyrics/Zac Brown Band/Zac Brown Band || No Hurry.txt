
You know my old car needs washing 
And the front yard needs a trim 
And the telephone keeps ringing 
And the bossman knows I know its him 
And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves 
No matter anyway 
Cause I ain't in no hurry today 

There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole 
And the smell of early spring 
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair 
On a quiet shady river bank 
Let the world go on without me 
Wouldn't have it any other way 
Cause I ain't in no hurry today 

Ain't in no hurry 
I'd Be a fool now to worry 
About all those things I can't change 
And the time that I borrow 
Can wait till tomorrow 
Cause I ain't in no hurry today 

When I must return 
To the cold cold ground 
Have 'em take their time 
When they lay this sinner down 

Heaven knows that I ain't perfect 
I've raised a little cain 
And I plan to raise a whole lot more 
Before I hear those angels sing 
(Gonna get right with the lord) 
But there'll be hell to pay 
But I ain't in no hurry 

Ain't in no hurry 
Be a fool now to worry 
About all those things I can't change 
And the time that I borrow 
Can wait till tomorrow 
Cause I ain't in no hurry 
Ain't in no hurry 
Ain't in no hurry today
