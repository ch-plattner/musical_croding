
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way? 
I was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to 
Now I'm sittin' here going crazy trying to crawl back to you 
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way? 

But I was smart enough to come to my senses 
Be who you need me to be 
And if you say that I'm too late 
I'll curl up and die in misery 
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way 

I remember our first kiss on the 4th of July 
I'll never miss another one of those 
I'll be by your side 

If my foolish heart was wrong, 
this truly was never meant to be 
Well I only hope that he'll count his lucky stars 
and love you as much as me 

Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way [3x]
