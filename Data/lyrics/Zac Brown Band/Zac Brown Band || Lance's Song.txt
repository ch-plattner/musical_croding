
Doing what you love has a high price to pay
Some put on a suit, but he ran the other way
Drums drown out the yuppies
And the one's who couldn't dream
Cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything

They don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

Rollin down the windows
Trying hard to fight the sleep
Money's never much for a band in Tennessee
Another night of playing
To a crowd with no ears
Wanna hear the songs they know
And fill their bellies full of beer

But they don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

And when he closed his eyes
Fell into a dream that never dies
And when the thunder comes
You can hear his kick drum in the sky
Feel the rain
Fall from our eyes

Cause we don't know
What we got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
For him there's no more waiting
Got his silver invitation
Just to do a little playing
For the big band in the sky
