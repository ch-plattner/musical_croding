You come walking in to the room with a smile on your face
And I keep wondering what a girl like you is doin' in this place
I catch your eye, you're lookin' at me and I spill my drink
From over here, that smile on your face it makes me think
Can you make me want to be a better man?
You got to have strength to bring me back from where it is I've been
Can you make me want to be a better man
Cause I'm gonna need, every little bit of your love
(Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of your love)
Last time I held a woman in my arms this tight
I thought she was anything and everything I'd ever really need in my life
But just like every other woman she couldn't handle my foolish ways
And if you're lookin' for a lover there's a few things I have to say
Can you make me want to be a better man?
You got to have strength to bring me back from where it is I've been
Can you make me want to be a better man
Cause I'm gonna need, every little bit of your love
(Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of your love)
Coming down, yeah, she covers me
Every bit of a lady
And casting down my anxiety
My, oh my, isn't she lovely?
Can you make me want to be a better man?
You got to have strength to bring me back from where it is I've been
Can you make me want to be a better man
Cause I'm gonna need, every little bit of your love
(Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of your love)
