[Violin playing]

So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

We drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you

Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Ever be

No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
All we need is love

We're free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Ever be

So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you
