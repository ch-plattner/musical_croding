
There ain't enough of me to go around
Got all kinds of reasons
To be all over town
Spread thin and broken down
Everybody wants a piece
Oh darlin I'm afraid

You've been last but not least
Everyone I love the most
Has to take what's left of me
I put it all together
But I left out one big piece
I put you last
But you're not least

Nothing ever takes the place of you
Sometimes things that may not matter
Jump in front of things that do
And your fine to stand in line
While history repeats
But oh darlin not this time

Last but not least
Everyone I love the most
They deserve the best from me
I put it all together
When I found that missing piece
You were the last
But you're not least

I go left when I should go right
I chase the dark when I see light
I trip and fall down every time I try
To walk that line
The sun comes up I look for rain
I search for joy and I find the pain
I swear I will not forget again
Last but not least

Last but not least
Everyone I love the most
Is gonna see the best of me
I put it all together
When I found the missing piece
You were the last
You were the last
But you're not least
