
I went down to Houston
And I stopped in San 'Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something
But I wasn't sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust

And I went down to Cleveland, that's where I went insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

Never been to Vegas, but I gambled up my life
Though the newsprint boats are raced in sewer mains
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that "some things never change"

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

And out here in the city seems like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the South

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home
May you one day carry me home.
