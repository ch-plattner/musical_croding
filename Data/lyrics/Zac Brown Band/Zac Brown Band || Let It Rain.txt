
Maybe I’m wounded. The pain it is passing.
Can you hold back the show for a while?
Beneath the hat that I’m wearing the storms are all brewing and maybe its time to go on.
Structure is quoting and the wood it is cracking and the thoughts are all starting to fall.
And it’s more to say than what’s been said and people are climbing the wall.

Let it Rain. Let it pour.
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard with things they cant hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out.
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth.
Threes no room left for darkness when, you’re filled with the light it comes out.

The truth hurts the worse so you might as well face it so the slate can again be wiped clean.
Standing on the shore of tomorrow’s horizon let music set you free. 

Let it Rain. Let it pour.
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard with things they cant hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out.
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth.
Threes no room left for darkness, when you’re filled with the light it comes out.

It’s a call to all fighters, to all sinners and thieves.
Fill the years with the music that set their hearts free.
I smash these stings till me fingers bleed.
Lay down all your burdens (to sing back to me?)

Let it Rain. Let it pour.
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard with things they cant hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out.
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth.
Threes no room left for darkness when, you’re filled with the light.
Threes no room left for darkness babe.
Threes no room left for darkness when, you’re filled with the light it comes out.
