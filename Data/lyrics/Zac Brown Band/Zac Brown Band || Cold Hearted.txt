Fell to my knees with a knife in my back, 
Never thought you'd be the kind to do something like that, 
But you did 
Cold hearted 

You talked so sweet, and your smell it made me weak, 
And I fell so fast that I never thought to ask 
If you were 
Cold hearted 

An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth 
I want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do 
I don't think that I could be so 
Cold hearted 

Pretty little words covered your dark and crooked heart 
With a forked tongue I fell in love, 

Then I fell apart 
You are so 
Cold hearted 

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth 
I want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do 
I don't think that I could be so 
Cold hearted 

An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth 
Want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do 
I don't think that I could be so 
Cold hearted
