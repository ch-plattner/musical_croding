Cried all night when you told me that I'd lost you
I died inside as I watched you walk away
And all this time I didn't doubt your reasons
But I can't heal what you can't replace

But now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Pulled up my favorite chair at my favorite tavern
I turned to see you standing there with envy in your eyes
And I saved your life from 13 years of anger
But I broke every bone on the way home swinging at the sky

Now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Stumbled in to find you cryin' in the kitchen
I argued with a broken heart and fabricated pride
And the battle raged for hours, but I didn't have the power
To make you understand so you turned and said goodbye

Now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Now I sleep like a baby
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do, nothing to do, nothing to do with you
