On the breeze you came blowing in
Never knew I'd give myself again
Like a bird floating on the wind
Your heart was made for flying

One day with you
Is all that it takes
To bring me back again, I fall
I'm always careless
Never concerned where I land

In the night like a long lost friend
My heart wondering where you been
We'll never lose our way again
Our flame, it is undying

One day with you
Is all that it takes, yes
To heal me again, I fall
I'm always careless
Never concerned where I land

Oh, you lift me up off the ground
(Light as a feather)
Time after time
My love for you climbs
Over and over and over and over

One day with you
Is all that it takes, yes
To bring me back again, I fall
I'm always careless
Never concerned where I land

(Na na na na)
All I really need is your love
(Na na na na na na, that's all baby)
(Na na na na)
All I really need is your love
(Na na na na na na, that's all baby)
All that I want is

One day with you
Is all that it takes
