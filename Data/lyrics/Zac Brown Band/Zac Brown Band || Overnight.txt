That I can take
I want you
And I ain't gonna have you any other way

Ain't no time for talking
Show me what you got
We're gonna get this bed rocking
And it ain't gonna stop

Roll your body like you do
Don't be afraid to move it
You got everything I like so
Why don't you get right to it
Come on let yourself go crazy
Come on girl amaze me
I'm your judge and jury
So you have to do the time

Overnight

(You're getting locked up)
Overnight

First I'm gonna search your body over
I gotta make sure
You ain't hidin nothin nowhere

Ain't no time for talking
Show me what you got
We're gonna get this bed rocking
And it ain't gonna stop
Ain't no time for talking
Show me what you got
We're gonna get this bed rocking
And it ain't gonna stop

Roll your body like you do
Don't be afraid to move it
You got everything I like so
Why don't you get right to it
Come on let yourself go crazy
Come on girl amaze me
I'm your judge and jury
So you have to do the time

Tell me how you want it
Oh wait, you better show
You better show me

Show me what you got
We're gonna get this bed rocking
And it ain't gonna stop
