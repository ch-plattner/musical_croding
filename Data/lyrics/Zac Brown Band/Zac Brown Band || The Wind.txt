30,000 feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fadin' concrete skyline
Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keepin' you
Like the Northern wind a blowin'
Yeah my lonely heart was frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours, too.

Where the wind blows babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

The city lights look like a country sky
Like staring at the stars turned upside down.
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around.
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances here at love are precious few
Someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to.

Where the wind blows babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

So I'll fly all night
Our memory's my lullaby
That love won't lie
If it's love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide
If love don't lie
Lie
We can fly

Where the wind blows babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere, my love will find you anywhere
Anywhere, my love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love
