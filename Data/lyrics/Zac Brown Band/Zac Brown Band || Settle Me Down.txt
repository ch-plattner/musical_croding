
A man's blood runs hot
As high as the temple will go
Though we can deny our nature, baby
It makes us less in control 

There's a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand
With secrets that she only knows
Oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes 
And it's to her that I must go

Cause she settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down 
C'mon

Oh it's not my style
To be afraid
Of what evil men gon' do
And I won't live in fear
I know why I'm here
Yeah, I'm sheltered and watched after too

'Cause these people put on the fine business suits
And they step on your face 'til they're going
Oh, the money, the cursin', when it's time for the hearse
Only bankers and lawyers are showin' 

Come and settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down 

Bye, bye, bye, bye 

Hey boys, 
Listen right here.
This ain't ever gonna get on country radio
I'm tellin' ya'
You gotta change your style

C'mon

Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down 

Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood

Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
