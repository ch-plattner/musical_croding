
Some saints have fallen from on high
Through cold stained glass
The fire's calling
Crawling down the burning match

Gold fires
The wicked bells they crash
No grave
To save me from my haunted past

Hey man, I know where the river goes
Hey man, you will reap what you sow

You can't find a way to take your heart
And make it fly away
So you can live another day without this pain
Better to've loved and lost
Than to never've loved at all
That's what they say
A black heart is gonna pay for what's it's done

Way down
Upon the cold, cold ground
Come down
The water's raging out

Hey man, I know where the river goes
Hey man, you will reap what you sow

Hey man, I know where the river goes
Hey man, you will reap what you sow

Hey man, I know where the river goes
