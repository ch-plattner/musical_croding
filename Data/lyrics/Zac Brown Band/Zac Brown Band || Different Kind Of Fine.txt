
She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar
Well, that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks
She sure don't need those

She's a cool drink of water
When the summer's mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long

She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

She's a lawyer's queen and a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Tan and lean like a long-neck bottle
In the passenger seat
Got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there right on time

Lord, take you down to Tijuana
Make you wanna slap your momma
Gotcha all tore up and made you spill your dip cup
Bona fide, a different kind of fine

Make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

She's a lawyer's queen and a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
She make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

A lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
A baseball hat fit for a queen
Genuine, a different kind of fine!
Lord, Lord!
