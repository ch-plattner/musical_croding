
Can't tell where the sky begins
And the water ends
No clouds to hide the sun
Waves playing me
A symphony upon the sand
As I lay drifting on the ocean
With this bottle in my hand

Sat down on the boardwalk
For a little while
Your memory, my company
Something 'bout this place
Had a way to make you smile
You always loved this island breeze

The wind whistling 'cross my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me
So I raise it up and toast
The day we met and won't forget
The way you love me
The amazing way you love me

It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face
Hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet

Doctor said there's nothing we can do
Took my hand, said take me home
To the only place with half a chance
To take the pain away
Make me feel alive before I go

You said life is only borrowed
So let's wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won't be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets
And don't forget how much I love you
I love you

It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face
Hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet

I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don't ever have to leave
When I poured you 'cross the southern sky
I couldn't help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings

Bitter, bittersweet
Bittersweet, oh

The wind whistling 'cross my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me
So raise it up and toast the day we met
I won't forget the way you love me
The amazing way you love me
It's bittersweet
