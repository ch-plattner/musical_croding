
You can’t be who you want to be 
If the one you with don't want to be like you.
And you can’t see what you want to see
If another's eyes don't see it like you.
I’m not saying follow me 
Just understand what I’m gonna do
You want me to change the man I am 
Just cause you asked me to.

But it’s My Life My Way
I don’t care what people say

Man if it was up to me
I’d probably drink my life away
Spend my time chasing ladies.
And layin in the sun
Now don’t tell me that I’m crazy 
Because I’m not the only one.

You can’t be with the one you love
If the one you love is a long way from you.
And absence makes the heart grow fonder 
Well love the one your with well that works too.

But it’s My Life My Way
I don’t care what people say
Man if it was up to me
I’d probably drink my life away
Spend my time chasing ladies.
And layin in the sun
Now don’t tell me that I’m crazy 
Because I’m not the only one.

Well I live the way I live because I want to
And I chose what’s best for now and not later on
And what I did today did not make you happy.
Then tomorrow make your choices on your own,
Cause it’s your life your way
You shouldn’t care what people say
Got to do what makes you happy
Got to live your life your own dam way
But I’ll be chasing ladies
And laying in the sun
Now don’t tell me that I’m crazy 
Because I’m not the only one.
Not the only one
Not the only one
