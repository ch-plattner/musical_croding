
Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growin'
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
How far I am from ok, ok let me tell you
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone

You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
That storm is gonna come
Gonna wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

There's no good reason why
We can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

[Guitar solo]

Go round in circles
Like an old golden band
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then somthin' comes over me
I lose my head
I guess God did not make me
A one woman man

I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're long long gone
