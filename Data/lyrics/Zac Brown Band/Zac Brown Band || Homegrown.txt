
I got a piece of land, out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun
Warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? 
‘Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms ‘round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need and nothing that I don’t
Homegrown, Homegrown

We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle 
Livin' like we’ll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don’t believe me
Why would I ever leave?
‘Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms ‘round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need and nothing that I don’t
Homegrown, Homegrown

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown

It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want

I got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
