Waiting for the sunlight
To come rising from the sea
We lay undercover
Shaded by the mango tree
We could stay forever
Never leave this paradise
Swaying in the ocean breeze
To the rhythm of the tide

Tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Take your time, 'cause we got
Time to borrow

I love you
Say that you love me too
And we can turn
The whole world upside down
Just us two
Nobody else will do
'Cause baby, you're
The only one for me
Underneath the mango tree

Drifting like the ocean
Daydreams dancing in the wind
Sand is sticking to our bodies
Just like sugar on our skin
The day is getting older
Oh, but we are still so young
Higher than the stars above
And faded like the sun

Tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Take your time, 'cause we got
Time to borrow

I love you
Say that you love me too
And we can turn
The whole world upside down
Just us two
Nobody else will do
(It's me and you)
'Cause baby, you're
The only one for me
(Oh, you're so sweet)
Underneath the mango tree

I love you
(I know you do)
Say that you love me too
(I love you too)
We can turn
The whole world upside down
Ah, just us two
(It's me and you)
Nobody else will do
Baby, you're
You're the only one for me
(Baby, you're the only one for me)
Baby, you're the only one for me
(Baby, you're the only one for me)
Underneath the mango tree
