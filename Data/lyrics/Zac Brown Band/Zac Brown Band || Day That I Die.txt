
Early morning in a motel room,
Sunshine trying to creep on through.
Lost Sleep but I found a tune,
Stuck inside my head.
Cigarettes and tank of gas,
Headed off to nowhere fast,
Gotta find a way to make this feeling last.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just kept on chasing that melody.
And as time goes by,
It's funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
And when I've lived out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.

A part of dawn to be ashamed of,
But good people are supposed to be up.
But I found peace with the path I took,
As I lay down my head.
Crossroads you gotta choose,
Which way do we win or lose.
But every bone in my soul says I sing on through.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing these melodies.
And as time goes by,
Its funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
And when I've lived out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.

We all go, we all go,
It's all over 'fore you know.

I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing these melodies,
And as time goes by,
Its funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna say that I,
Was a man who really loved and never compromised.
And while I live out my days,
Until the very end,
You can find me in my home, a guitar in my hands,
And you can find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.
Whoa, oh.
