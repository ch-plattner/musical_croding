A man was bothering me today and I 
wanted to tell him to go away 
But I stood and listened to him anyway, okay. 
He said he didn't want to shoot that man 
And it was his thing and I wouldn't understand 
And he had done all that he can, okay. 

I guess his body was as good as mine 
And just like me he was wasting time 
Turning over every stone to see what he could find, okay. 
He was filling tank and he asked for money 
I lied and said I didn't have any 
Then my conscious took over and I gave him a hand full of change. 

Don't do a thing. 
Stay right there. 
You'll lie there. 
You don't seem to care 

I know its hard to survive in the city 
When the beautiful days don't look so pretty 
And you don't have windows to keep the night away, okay. 
He was dirty and stink and just a bit crude 
But I didn't say that because that's kind of rude 
And he didn't care what I had to say in the first place, okay. 

I wanted to say you're a big disgrace to the world, 
yourself, and the human race 
And reach back and pop him one good time in the face, okay. 
No its not okay and I didn't do that 
But I gave him a smile and tipped my hat and told him to have a very nice rest 
of the day 

Don't do a thing. Don't do a thing. 
Stay right there. 
You'll lie there. You'll lie there. 
You don't seem to care. 

Guess he bought some booze or shit 

And sure that bothers me a little bit but it's his life and I can't tell him 
how to live it 

As he turned and started to go his way I tried to think of something wise to 
say like... 

Don't do a thing. 
Stay right here. 
You'll lie here. 
You don't seem to care. 
You'll die here. 
You don't seem to care
