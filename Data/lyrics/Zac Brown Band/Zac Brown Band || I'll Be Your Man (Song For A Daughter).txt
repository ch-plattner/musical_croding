You're gonna make the finest momma someday
Some man will take you away
But until then
Chase down your dreams
Laugh all the time and believe
That love's gonna conquer all things
So until then
I'll be your man

There was a time when I thought I knew love until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying but you're always gonna be my baby girl

So as you walk through this life you will see
The world's what you want it to be
But until then
Go on and dance, dance like there's no one around
Never stop singing out loud
And until then
I'll be your man

There was a time when I thought I knew love until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying but you're always gonna be my baby girl

Go and have a ball
Take every chance that you make
You know I'll be one call away
I'll always be
I'll always be your man

Hold on child, hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child, hold on tight to your old man
I'm gonna hold you tight under my wing long as I can
Hold you tight under my wing long as I can

Hold on child (sweet child of mine)
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child (hold on tight)
Hold on tight to your hold man
(Your old man loves you)

Hold on tight
I'm gonna hold you tight (hold on child)
Under my wing long as I can (you're my my my my girl)
Hold you tight
Your old man loves you (Under my wing long as I can)
You're my babe, my babe, my baby
You're my babe, my babe, my baby
Hold on tight (I will hold on)
Under my wing long as I can (love's gonna find you my child)
Hold on child, under my wing (love's gonna conquer)
Under my wing, under my wing
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
I'll be your man
