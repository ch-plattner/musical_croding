I passed out last night and I never made it home.
Wound up on a bus to San Antone.
My head hurts bad and I ain't wearing shoes.
Going to find my wallet and my way home to you.

We're gonna make this day.
A little better than the last.
It's amazing how slow days like this can go.
Find a way to wash away.
Any regret you have don't let this moment pass.
Live inside this day.

I got cuffs on my hands.
Chains on my feet.
Got locked up for the second time this week.
And I know I make you cry but girl my love is true.
Going to find my wallet and my way back home to you.

We're gonna make this day.
A little better than the last.
It's amazing how slow days like this can go.
Find a way to wash away.
Any regret you have don't let this moment pass.
Live inside this day.

Now I'm back on the street.
Thumb in the air.
Don't know how the hell that I got here.
But I'm gonna hitch that ride.
If it's the last thing I do.
Gonna find that wallet and bring it home to you.

We're gonna make this day.
A little better than the last.
Know don't you let this life come whoop your...
Find a way to wash away.
And regret you have.
