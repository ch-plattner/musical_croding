Whooooooooooa whooooooa whooooa who knows

When I was a baby child
My daddy said to me
Many mountains we must climb
Before we'll be free
But he never told me
About the bruises on my knees
How they would be the map that leads him where we need to be
And oh that storm came down
Forty days, forty nights

Who knows
What the thunder and lightning will bring
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more
Who knows
Which way the wind is blowing
And when we look back on these things
We won't cry no more

Whoooooooooa whooooooa whooooa who knows

Wandering blindly
Searching for the truth
And anchored to a solid rock
That we could hold on to
But there's no tomorrow
Not for everyone
Who will hear your last harsh words
When your time on earth is gone
Ooooh that storm came down
Forty days, forty nights

Who knows
What the thunder and lightning will bring
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more
Who knows
Which way the wind is blowing
And when we look back on these things
We won't cry no more

Whoa tilt the lamp now
Don't let the wind blow it out
Oh guide the light child
Cause one day it's gonna shine
Sing up till the darkness it is lifted
Sing up till the darkness it is lifted
