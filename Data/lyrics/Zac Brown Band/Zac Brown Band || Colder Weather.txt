
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in,
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay,
She's answered by the tail lights shining through the window pane

[Chorus:]
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'.

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln,
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin',
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same ol' light a-shinin',
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

[Chorus:]
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin' (born for leavin')

Well, it's a winding road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover â€“ I'm a runner
And we go 'round 'n 'round
And I love you but I leave you
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you who calls me back here, baby

Oh I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change (I ain't ever gonna change)
I got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin' (born for leavin')

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then
