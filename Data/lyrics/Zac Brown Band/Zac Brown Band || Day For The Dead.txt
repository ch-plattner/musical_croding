
I see them rise
From beneath the ground
Life was lost but now it's found
The ghosts want somethin'
To take their turn 
To dance around the stone
Work the fingers to the bone
Hold on to nothin'

Day for the dead,
To dance among the living
Day for the dead 
To dance among the living

We find forgiveness 
For the wrong we've done
Watch the dyin' of the day
Another settin' sun
We find redemption
In the love we've won
Just a little company 
Until our work is done

Day for the dead
To dance among the living
Day for the dead 
To dance among the living

Who says you can't go back?
Who says you can't go back,
Back to where you started from? (are you ready?)
Who says you can't go back? (are you ready?)
Who says you can't go back,
Back to where you started from? (are you ready)
Who says you can't go back? (are you ready?)

The bone falls on the river Styx 
The man who makes you dead
Coins lay on his eyes
Just to pay your fare

Day for the dead 
To dance among the living 

Day for the dead 
To dance among the living
Day for the dead 
To dance among the living
