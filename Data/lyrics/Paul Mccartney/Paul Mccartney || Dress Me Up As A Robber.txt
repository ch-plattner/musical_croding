Well You Can Dress Me Up As A Robber
But I Won't Be In Disguise
Only Love Is A Robber
And He Lives Within Your Eyes
Ooh, Ooh Eee Ooh

You Can Dress Me Up As A Sailor
But I'll Never Run To Sea
As Long As Your Love Is Available To Me
What Do I Do With A Sea Of Blue?
Ooh, Eee Ooh

Dressing Me Up
It Doesn't Make A Difference
What You Want To Do
Whichever Way You Look At It
I'm Still In Love With You
If We Go On Forever
I May Never Make A Change

Dressing Me Up
And If I Don't Convince You
You Needn't Look Too Far
To See That I'm Not Lying
'Cos I Love You The Way You Are
And What's The Point Of Changing
When I'm Happy As I Am?

Well You Can Dress Me Up As A Soldier
But I Wouldn't Know What For
I Was The One That Told You He Loved You
Don't Wanna Go To Another War
No, No, No
