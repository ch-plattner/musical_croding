Staring from a cardboard castle
Down and out
One of life's young students
Finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters
Angry taxy drivers shout

From the pages of a paper
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop
Wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that
No one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Sometimes
When eyes meet you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes
Birds of a feather
Got to fly together

From a dingy attic window
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the
Highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue
