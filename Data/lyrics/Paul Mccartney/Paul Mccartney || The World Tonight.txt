
I saw you sitting at the center of a circle
Everybody,
Everybody wanted something from you
I saw you sitting there

I saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Caught you playing
Caught you praying to the voice inside you
I saw you swaying there

I don't care what you want to be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away

I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

I heard you listening to a secret conversation
You were crying
You were trying not to let them hear you
I heard you listening in

Never mind what they want to do
You got a right, to your point of view
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away

I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

I saw you hiding from a flock of paparazzi
You were hoping
You were hoping that the ground would swallow you
I saw you hiding there

I don't care what you want to be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away

I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

Look into the future

I can see the world tonight

See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight
I can see the world tonight
