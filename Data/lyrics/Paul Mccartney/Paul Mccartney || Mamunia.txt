Mamunia mamunia mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia mamunia oh oh oh oh
The rain comes falling from the sky,
To fill the stream that fills the sea
And that's where life began for you and me

So the next time you see rain it ain't bad,
Don't complain it rains for you,
The next time you see l.a. rainclouds,
Don't complain it rains for you and me

Mamunia...

It might have been a bright blue day
But rainclouds had to come this way
They're watering everything that they can see.

A seed is waiting in the earth
For rain to come and give him free,
So the next time you see l.a. rainclouds
Don't complain, it rains for you.

So lay down your umbrellas
Strip off your plastic macs.
You've never felt the rain my friend,
Till you've felt it running down your back

So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad
Don't complain, it rains for you.
The next time you see l.a. rainclouds
Don't complain it rains for you and me.

Mamunia...
