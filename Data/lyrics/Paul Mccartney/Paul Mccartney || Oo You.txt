
Look like a woman,
Dressed like a lady.
Talk like a baby, ooh-ooh,
Love like a woman, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ooh-ooh, you,
Ow!
Ooh, you.

Walk like a woman, ooh-ooh,
Sing like a blackbird, ah-ha.
Eat like a hungry, ooh-ooh,
Cook like a woman, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ooh-ooh, woman, oh-oh-oh.
Ow!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh, you.

Look like a woman,
Oo-oo-oo, dressed like a lady.
Oo-oo-oo, talk like a baby,
Golly, golly, golly, golly, go, go, ooh.
Love like a woman, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Ooh.....
