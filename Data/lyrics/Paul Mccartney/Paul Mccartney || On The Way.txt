
Well You Know I'll Always Love You
But It Would Have Been A Lie
If I Said That I Could Please You
Every Moment That I Try

Wouldn't Want To See You Crying
So L Hope You Don't Mind
The Things I Say
On The Way

Well We've Been Traveling For A Long Time
And We Finally Finished Here
Though I Said Some Things To Hurt You
Well It Was Only Out Of Fear

Wouldn't Want To See You Crying
So L Hope You Don't Mind
The Things I Say
On The Way

Well You Know I'll Always Love You
Everything Will Be Alright
If I Know You Don't Mind
The Things I Say
On The Way

Well You Know I'll Always Love You
Everything Will Be Ok
If I Know You Don't Mind
The Things I Say
On The Way
