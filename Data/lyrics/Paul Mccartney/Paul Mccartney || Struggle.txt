Want to get you in my heart again
Want to love you once more
Want to have you in my heart again
Want to get you once more

If you wanna love, if you wanna fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight

When I get you home, what I wanna do
Babe, I wanna sample everything with you
Yes, I wanna love you, I don't wanna fight
I can think of something when I get you home tonight

All I want is loving, anything will do
I'm your glass of poison and I'm acting up on you

If you wanna love, if you wanna fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight
[x2]

Yeah, you know what you got here
You got the same old story happening again
The eternal struggle, the destiny of man

It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle, the destiny of man

If you wanna love, if you wanna fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight
All I want is love, anything will do
I'm your glass of poison and I'm acting up on you

It's the same old song
Being sung in the background, being sung up front
But if you wanna get it right, you gotta listen
Heed my words, listen to me!

Anytime you want me, I'm not hard to find
I can't get your loving, I can't get you off my mind
But if I need you sometime, you got me here right now
We can work it out together, we'll get through this somehow

It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle, the destiny of man
[x4]

It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle
