Ah, She Tastes Like Wine
Such A Human Being So Divine
Oh She Feels Like Sun
Mother Nature Look At What You're Done

Oh I Feel Like Letting Go
Oh I Feel Like Letting Go.

Ah, She Looks Like Snow
I Want To Put Her In A Broadway Show
Ah She'll Dance And Dine
Like A Lucifer She'll Always Shine

Oh I Feel Like Letting Go
Oh I Feel Like Letting Go.

Oh I Feel Like Letting Go.

Ah, She Sings It So
I Want To Put Her On The Radio
One Day And There You Are
Ladies And Gentleman -
A Brand New Star.

Oh I Feel Like Letting Go
Oh I Feel Like Letting Go.
