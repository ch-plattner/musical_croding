Love
Flow like water
Through my face
Flow to me
Home to me
Home to me now
Home to me

Like the swallow
In my face
Flow to me
Home to me
Home to me now
Home to me

Is this love?
Is this love?

Is this love?
We must discover
Perfect love between each other

Love
Flow like water
Through my face
Flow to me
Home to me
Home to me now
Home to me

Like the Swallow
In my face
Flow to me
Home to me
Home to me

Help me find the cist of love
Help me find the fountain of love
Is this love?
Help me, help me, help me, help me

Is this love?

Flow to me
