Said farewell to my last hotel it never was much kind of abode
Glasgow town never brought me down when i was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty, and the kendal freeway is fast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, i wanna make this journey last

Helen (helen) hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (helen) hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

M6 south down liverpool, where they play the west coast sound
Sailor sam, he came from birmingham, but he never will be found
Doin' fine when a london sign, grees me like a long lost friend
Mister motor won't you check her out, she's gotta take me back again

Helen (helen) hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (helen) hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime, i wanna get my right foot down;
Shake some dust off of this old bus, i gotta get her out of town
Spend the day upon the motorway, where the carburettors blast;
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, i wanna make this journey last

Helen (helen) hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (helen) hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Say bye-bye.....fade out
