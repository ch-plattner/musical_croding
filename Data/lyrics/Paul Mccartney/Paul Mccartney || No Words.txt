You want to give your love away
And end up giving nothing
I'm not surprised, that your black eyes
Are gazing.
You say that love is everything
And what we need the most of
I wish you knew, that's just how true
My love was.

No words for my love

You're burning love, sweet burning love
It's deep inside,
You mustn't hide, your burning love
Sweet burning love, your burning love.

You want to turn your head away
And someone's thinking of you
I wish you'd see, it's only me,
I love you.

No words for my love
