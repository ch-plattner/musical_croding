
Every Day She Takes A Morning Bath S E Wets Her Hair,
Wraps A Towel Around Her
As She's Heading For The Bedroom Chair,
It's Just Another Day.
Slipping Into Stockings,
Stepping Into Shoes,
Dipping In The Pocket Of Her Raincoat.
Ah, It's Just Another Day.

At The Office Where The Papers Grow She Takes A Break,
Drinks Another Coffee
And She Finds It Hard To Stay Awake,

It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
Lt's Just Another Day.

Ay
So Sad, So Sad,
Sometimes She Feels So Sad.
Alone In Her Apartment She'd Dwell,
Till The Man Of Her Dreams Comes To Break The Spell.

Ah, Stay, Don't Stand Around
And He Comes And He Stays
But He Leaves The Next Day,
So Sad.
Sometimes She Feels So Sad.

As She Posts Another Letter To The Sound Of Five,
People Gather 'Round Her
And She Finds It Hard To Stay Alive,

It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
It's Just Another Day.

Ay
So Sad, So Sad,
Sometimes She Feels So Sad.
Alone In Her Apartment She'd Dwell,
Till The Man Of Her Dreams Comes To Break The Spell.

Ah, Stay, Don't Stand Around
And He Comes And He Stays
But He Leaves The Next Day,
So Sad.
Sometimes She Feels So Sad.

Every Day She Takes A Morning Bath She Wets Her Hair,
Wraps A Towel Around Her
As She's Heading For The Bedroom Chair,
It's Just Another Day.

Slipping Into Stockings,
Stepping Into Shoes,
Dipping In The Pockets Of Her Raincoat.

Ah, It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
It's Just Another Day. Du Du Du Du Du
It's Just Another Day.
