
Nothing too much
Just out of sight
You say you love me
If this is true
The best thing to do
Is to lye down beside me
I said I love you
Well nothing too much
Just out of sight

Oh don't you want to be fair?
When you went away
In the twilight
It was alright
It was alright
Alright

I love you
I said I love you
I thought you knew
The last thing to do was
To try to betray me
The new morning light
I'll never forget it
Nothing much just out of sight

Twilight
Out of my sight
I was more than upset
Nothing too much
Alright

I can remember
Your beautiful hair
I can remember
Why can't you take me there?
Don't you try betray me?
Oh wanna betray me?
I was ready to test
I was ready to test with the whites of your ribs

It was alright
Alright
Not nothing too much
Just out of sight

Well nothing too much
Just out of sight
Out of my sight
Beautiful hair
I was really upset
In the moonlight
In the twilight
Of the last night
It was alright
Alright
Alright

Well nothing too much
It's alright
Just out of sight
The last thing to do was to try to betray me
