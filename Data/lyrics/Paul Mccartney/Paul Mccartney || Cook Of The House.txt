Ground rice, sugar, vinegar, seco salt, macaroni too,
Cook of the house,
I'm the cook of the house.

No matter where I serve my guests,
They seem to like the kitchen best 'cause I'm the cook of the house,
Cook of the house.

The salad's in the bowl,
The rice is on the stove.
Green beans in the colander and where the res is heaven only knows.

Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper, corn-bread, curry powder, coffee too,
Cook of the house,
I'm the cook of the house.

No, matter where I serve my guests,
They seem to like the kitchen best.
'cause I'm the cook of the house,
Cook of the house.

Where the rest is heaven only knows.

Matter where I serve my guests,
They seem to like the kitchen best 'cause I'm the cook of the house.
Cook of the house,
Cook of the house,
I'm the cook of the house.
