
Step into the misty mountains
With your hair like ambered honey
To feeling warm and breezes
Let me sweetly

Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
And your loving conversation
And your innocent solution

Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

You feel the warm and breezes
You give me hands of warmth
Give me one f your hands
Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
Give me one of your hands
Let me kiss your lips of silver
Let me kiss your lips of silver

Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion

Loving conversation
Loving conversation
Innocent solution
Make my lifelong passion
