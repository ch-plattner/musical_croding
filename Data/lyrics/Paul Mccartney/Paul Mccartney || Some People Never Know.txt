
No one else will ever see
how much faith you have in me,
Only fools would disagree that it's so,
Some people never know.

Like a fool I'm faraway,
ev'ry night I hope and pray
I'll be coming home to stay and it's so,
Some people never know.

Some people can sleep at nightime,
believing that love is a lie.
I'm only a preson like you, love,
and who in the world can be right
all the right time.
I know I was wrong, make me right, right.

Only love can stand the test,
only you outshine the rest,
Only fools take the rest,
Only fools take second best, but it's so,
Some people never know.
