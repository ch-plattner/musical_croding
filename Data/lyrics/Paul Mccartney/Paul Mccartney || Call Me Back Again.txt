
Well When I, When I Was
Just A Little Baby Boy
Every Night I Would Call
Your Number Brought Me Joy.

I Called Your House, Every Night Since Then
But I Ain't Never, No No Never
Heard You Calling Me
Come On And Call Me Back Again . . . . .

Call Me Back Again.

I've Heard Your Name Every Night Since Then
But I Ain't Never, No No Never . . . . .

Well When I, When I Was
Just A Little Baby Boy
Every Night, Every Night
I Would Call Because Your Number
Brought Me Joy

Oh - I've Called Your Name
Every Night Since Then,
But I Ain't Never, No No No No Never
Heard You Calling Me
Come On And Call Me Back Again.

Call Me Back Again.
