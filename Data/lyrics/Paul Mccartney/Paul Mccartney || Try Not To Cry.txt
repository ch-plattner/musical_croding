I can't, help it, but don't know this song
All day, I try to be a man
Help me to do it, If I don't know the song.

Try, try, try Try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you
Yes I try, try, try Try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you

I want to enjoy, being alive
Don't want to leave, before I arrive
I like to sing, I sing along
How can I do it, when I don't always know

I say Try, try, try Try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you
Yes I try, try, try Try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you

[Lead solo]

Baby I say Try, try, try Try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you
Yes I try, try, try Try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you ou ou, over you
