
I ride on the white wind
High over the sand
I follow the bluebird
I follow the wise

I glide on the green leaf
Not asking for more
I follow the white wind
I glide on the green leaf

I swim in the blue sea
I walk on the sand
I fly through the blue sky
To wherever you land

I ride on the white wind
To a far away shore
I follow the bluebird
To wherever she lands

I'll be traveling tonight
Oh across the sea
Where she waits, she waits for me
Across the broken sea
From the sea
From the sea

From across the endless sea
I'll be traveling tonight
