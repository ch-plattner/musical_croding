Notice how gently we spin
Here on the skin of a sphere, of a sphere
Now music to lull us to sleep
Now lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream, music to wake us from a dream
Music to wake us from a dream

Take us into the light
Notice how gently we spin
Here on the skin of a sphere
Music to lull us to sleep
First music to lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream

Notice how gently we spin
Here on the skin of a sphere
Music to lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream

Whether we are strong or we are weak
Whether we are foolish or are wise
We all seek the treasures of love
We all seek the pleasures of love

Music is the servant of the Queen and King
Who are happy if we smile but are delighted if we sing

Whether we are strong or are weak
Whether we are foolish or we are wise
We all seek the treasures hidden within love
We all seek the pleasures of love
Music is the treasure that we all can bring
We are happy if we smile
But are delighted when we sing

Whether we are strong or are weak
Whether we are foolish or wise
Ah treasures of love
We all seek the treasures of love
Ah pleasures of love
We all seek the pleasures of love
Ah love, treasures of love
Music is the treasure that we all can bring
And we are happy when we smile delighted when we sing
