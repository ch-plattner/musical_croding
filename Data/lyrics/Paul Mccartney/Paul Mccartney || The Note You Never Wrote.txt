Later on, the story goes,
A bottle floated out to sea.
After days, when it had found the perfect spot,
it opened up,
And I read the note that you never wrote to me

After all, I'm sure you know,
The Mayor of Baltimore is here.
After days now he can finally appear,
Now at last he's here,

But he never is gonna get my vote,
'cause he never is gonna get a quote
from the little note
that you never wrote to me.

Further on, along the line,
I was arrested on the shore,
Holding papers of governments galore.
I was taken in,

But I read the note that you never wrote.
Yes, I read the note that you never wrote.
Oh, I read the note that you never wrote to me.

To me.
To me.
To me.
