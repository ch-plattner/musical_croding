
Winters coming
It'll soon will be here
If we knew what it meant
We would take care

Snow is falling
Where the snow falls
If we knew what it meant
We would take care

We would dance
Light up the sky
With your message fly
With your message
Bells will ring out for our love

We can do it
Gonna do it tonight
Sing till we fly together
Dance till we're high together
Dance till we're high together

Write a letter to a new love
Drop a line to a true love
Winters coming
It'll soon be here
If we knew what it meant
We would take care

Shake our heads
We would be there

We would dance
Light up the sky
With your message fly
With your message
Bells will ring out for our love

We can do it
Gonna do it tonight
Sing till we fly together
Dance till we're high together
Gonna do it right now

Light up the sky
With your message fly
With your message
Bells will ring out for our love

We can do it
Gonna do it tonight
Sing till we fly together
Dance till we're high together
Dance till we're high together

Light up the sky
Sing till we fly together
Dance till we're high together
Gonna do it right now
