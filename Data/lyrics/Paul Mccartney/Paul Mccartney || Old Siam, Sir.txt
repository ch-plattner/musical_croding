
In a village in Old Siam, sir, there's a lady who's lost her way.
In an effort to find a man, sir, she found herself in the old UK.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.
In a village in old east end, sir, she mea fellow who made her real.
Took her rushes to show, this man, sir,
He met her dad at the wedding meal.

In a letter from Old Siam, sir, came an awful tale of woe.
She decided the only answer was to get off a pile of dough.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.
When a relative told her man, sir, he directed her not to stay.
In a village in Old Siam, sir, there's a lady who'se lost her way.

In a village in Old Siam, sir, there's a lady who'se lost her way.
In an effort to find a man, sir, she found herself in the old UK.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe, she skated 'round in Scarborough.

[repeat first two lines of last verse, then repeat until fade:]
Walthamstowe . . . Scarborough . . .
