
I saw two magpies
A girl and a boy
One for sorrow
Two for joy
With no salutes
I move away
And long to face, face ,face
Face down fear

I saw two magpies
There was a girl and a boy
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Content to cry
No more to lie
I move away
And lie in truth

Look two magpies
A girl and a boy
One for sorrow
And two for joy
Three for a girl
Four for a boy
I saw two magpies
Two for joy

Content to cry
No more to lie
In truth with you
To face down fear
Content to cry
No more to lie
No more to lie
And face down fear
