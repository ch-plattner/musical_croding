
Motor cars, handle bars,
Bicycles for two.
Broken hearted jubilee.

Parachutes, army boots,
Sleeping bags for two.
Sentimental jamboree.

Buy! buy!
Says the sign in the shop window.
Why? why?
Says the junk in the yard.

Da da ya da da da,
Da da da,
Da da ya da da,
Da da da da da da da.

Candlesticks, building bricks,
Something old and new.
Memories for you and me.

Buy! buy!
Says the sign in the shop window.
Why? why?
Says the junk in the yard.
