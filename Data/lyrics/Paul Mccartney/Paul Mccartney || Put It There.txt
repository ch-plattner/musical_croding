
Give me your hand,
I'd like to shake it,
I want to show you I'm your friend.
You'll understand,
If I can make it clear,
It's all that matters in the end.
Put it there,
If it weights a ton,
That's what a father says to his young son.
I don't care,
If it weights a ton,
As long as you and I are here, put it there.
Long as you and I are here, put it there
If there's a fight,
I'd like to fix it,
I hate to see things go so wrong.
The darkest night,
And all it's mixed emotions,
Are getting lighter sing along.
Put it there,
If it weights a ton,
That's what a father says to his young son.
I don't care,
If it weights a ton,
As long as you and I are here, put it there.
Long as you and I are here, put it there.
