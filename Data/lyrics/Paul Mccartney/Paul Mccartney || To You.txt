Would you still put me through what you put me through?
If it happened to you. What if it happened to you?

What if it happened a man kept shaking you down
But you can't get a ride to his side of town?
If it happened to you. What if it happened to you?

What if happened to you? Keep it out of my shoes.
And if you're stepping on toes, keep it outta my nose.

'Cos if the same thing happened to me
Well, it won't be as bad as it used to be.
If it happened toyou. What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you, too?

What if it happens to you?
What if it happens to you?

What if happens to you? Keep it out of my shoes.
and if you're stepping on toes, keep it outta my nose.


'Cos if the same thing happened to me
Well, it won't be as bad as it used to be.
If it happened to you. What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you?
What am I going to do?
What if it happened to you?
Well, what if happened to you?

[repeat until fade:]
What if happened to you?
