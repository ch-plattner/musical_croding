(This is it)
Spin it on, don't stop. Take it back to the top.
'Cos I gotwhole lotta love for you
I wanna spin it on. Spin it on!

Off to the flicks with the piddle in her nicks, to the fair with her hair
in curlers.
Their cousins didn't get all down to the pleasure dome
Their cousins didn't send their night in an aircraft hanger.
Memories . . .!

Spin it on, don't stop. Take it back to the top.
'Cos I got whole lotta love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on. Spin it on! Spin it on!

Spin it on!

Spin it on, don't stop. Take it back to the top
'Cos I got whole lotta love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on. Spin it on!

Off to the fields with a missionary's zeal for the life
of the wife of the farmer
Their cousins didn't get all down to the billiard hall
Their cousins didn't spend their time on a pinball table.
Memories . . .!

Spin it on, don't stop. Take it back to the top
'Cos I got whole lotta love for you.
I wanna spin it on. Spin it on!
Spin it on! Spin it on! I wanna spin it on! I wanna spin it on!
Spin it on! Don't Stop! Take it back to the top!
'Cos I got a whole lotta for you!
