There Is A Pain, Inside My Heart
You Mean So Much To Me
Girl, I Love You, Girl, I Love You So Bad

And If You Leave, My Pain Will Go
But That's No Good To Me
Girl, I Love You, Yes, I Love You So Bad

Well It Feels So Good, Sometimes It Feels So Bad
This Is Worse Than Anything I've Ever Had

There Was A Pain, But Now You're Here
And I Don't Fear A Thing
Girl, I Love You, Yes, I Love You So Bad
And She Said, Boy, I Love You
Boy, I Love You So Bad

[Solo]

Girl, I Love You
Girl, I Love You So Bad

Well It Feels So Good, Sometimes It Feels So Bad
This Is Worse Than Anything I've Ever Had

There Was A Pain, But Now You're Near
And I Don't Fear A Thing
Girl, I Love You
Girl, I Love You So Bad
And She Said
Boy, I Love You
Boy, I Love You So Bad
Girl, I Love You
Girl, I Love You
