
I'd like to walk in a field with you,
take my hat and my boots off too.
I'd like to lie in a field with you.
Would you like to do it too, may?
Would you like to do it too?
I'd like to stand in a stream with you,
roll my trousers up and not feel blue.
I'd like to wash in a stream with you.
Would you like to do it too?

You and I, country dreamer,
when there's nothing else to do;
Me oh my, country dreamer,
make a country dream come true.

I'd like to climb up a hill with you,
stand on top and admire the view.
I'd like to roll down a hill with you.
Would you like to do it too, may?
Would you like to do it too?

I'd like to climb up a hill with you,
take my hat and my boots off too.
I'd like to lie in a field with you.
Would you like to do it too, may?
Would you like to do it too?
