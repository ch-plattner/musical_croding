
I've just seen another sunset on my own.
All day long I've been alone,
and I must do something about it,
yes I must do something about it.

Played another losing cardgame with myself.
Lonely joker on ashalf,
and I must do something about it,
yes I must do something about it.

No one on the party line,
No one seems to need a dime,
No one even knows that I'm feeling this way.

I've just seen another suset on my own.
All day long I've been alone,
and I must do something about it,
yes I must do something about it.

No one seems to need my vote,
No one has to change a note,
No one here to hold my coat,
Oh, what a day.

I've just watched another movie on T.V.
No one's in the house but me,
and I must do something about it,
yes I must do something about it.

Oh, oh, something about it.

I've just dialed another number on my phone.
All day long I've been alone,
and I must do something about it...
