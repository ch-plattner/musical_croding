First you take me to the limit then expect me to stop
You know I'm sick and tired of waiting for the penny to drop
You make a living out of making people think you give it all away
But you and I know very well
There's always gonna be a price to pay

But times are tough
And life is hard
You've got enough
And so you'll pardon me for saying

You've had it all your way
You've got to know some day
You'll have to share or there'll be hell to pay

There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay

First you take me to the limit then expect me to stop
You know I'm sick and tired of waiting for the penny to drop
You make a living out of making people think you give it all away
But you and I know very well
There's always gonna be a price to pay

But times are tough
And life is hard
You've got enough
And so you'll pardon me for saying

You've had it all your way
You've got to know some day
You'll have to share or there'll be hell to pay

There will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay
Yeah there will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay

There's gonna be
There's gonna be
There's gonna be hell to pay
There's gonna be
There's gonna be
Oh yeah there's gonna be hell to pay
Gonna be hell to pay
Oh yeah
There's gonna be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
