Velvet, I can wish you,
For the collar of your coat,
And fortune smiling all along your way,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

Mansions, I can wish you,
Seven footmen all in red,
And calling cards upon a silver tray,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

Standing there,
Gazing at you,
Full of the bloom of youth,
Standing there,
Gazing at you,
With the sheep's eye,
And the licerish tooth.

Music, I can wish you,
Merry music while you're young,
And wisdom, when your hair has turned to gray,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

With the sheep's eye,
And the lickerish tooth,
And the strong arms,
To carry you away
