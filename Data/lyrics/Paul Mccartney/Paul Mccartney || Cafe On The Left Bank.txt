Cafe on the left bank, ordinary wine
Touching all the girls with your eyes
Tiny crowd of frenchmen round a tv shop
Watching charles de gaulle make a speech
Dancing after midnight, sprawling to the car
Continental breakfast in the bar
English-speaking people drinking german beer
Talking far too loud for their ears

Cafe on the left bank, ordinary wine
Touching all the girls with your eyes

Dancing after midnight, crawling to the car
Cocktail waitress waiting in the bar
English-speaking people drinking german beer
Talking way too loud for their ears
