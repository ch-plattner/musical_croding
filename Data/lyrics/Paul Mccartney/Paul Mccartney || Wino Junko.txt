Doctor Tom is getting on,
All he does is sign his name.
I get things my brainbox sings,
but I'll go down again.

Play with fire, getting higher,
Higher than a nine foot flame.
My soul is pent and so's the rent,
but I'll go down again.

Wino Junko can't say no,
Wino Junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no
till you go down again

This and treat you crazy cat,
Flying sideways once again.
I'm in a spin it makes me grin,
but I'll go down again.

Wino Junko can't say no,
Wino Junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no
till you go down again.

Till you go down again.
Till you go down again.
Till you go down.

Take what I need until I bleed,
People will say I've gone insane.
Ain't scared to die, it's such a high,
till I go down again.

Wino Junko can't say no,
Wino Junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no,
Till you go down again.

Wino Junko can't say no,
Wino Junko, eyes aglow.
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no,
Till you go down again.

Wino Junko...
