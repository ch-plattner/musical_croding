Well I Woke Up Late This Morning
My Head Was In The Whirl
Only When I Realized
I Lost My Little Girl
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Well Her Clothes Were Not Expensive
Her Hair
Didn't Always Curl
I Don't Know Why I Loved Her
But I Loved My Little Girl
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[2]
Well Gather Round People
Let Me Tell You The Story
The Very First Song I Wrote

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1]
