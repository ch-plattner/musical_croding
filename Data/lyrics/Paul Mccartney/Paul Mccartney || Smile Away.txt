I was walking down the street the other day,
Who did i meet?
I met a friend of mine and he did say:
"man, i can smell your feet a mile away."

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away,
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away.

Yeah, smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away,
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away.

I was walking down the street the other day,
Ah, who did i meet?
I met a friend of mine and he just said:
"man, i can smell your breath a mile away."

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away, oh,
Ho! smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah, smile away.

Ah, smile away sweetly now,
Come on now, ooh, sweetly smile away,
Yes, sir! smile away,
Now, smile away quietly now,
Oooh, ho, ho, ho.

Smile away horribly now,
Smile away, smile away, smile away,
Yes, sir! smile away,
Ah-oh,
