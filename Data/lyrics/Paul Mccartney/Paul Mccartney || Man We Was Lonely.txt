
Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
And we was hard pressed to find a smile.
Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
But now we're fine all the while.

I used to ride on my fast city line,
Singing songs that i thought were mine alone, alone.
Now, let me lie with my love for the time
I am home,  home, home.

Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
And we was hard pressed to find a smile.
Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
But now we're fine all the while.

Now, let me lie with my love for the time
I am home, home, home.

Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
And we was hard pressed to find a smile.
Man, we was lonely,
Yes, we was lonely,
But now we're fine all the while,
But now we're fine all the while,
But now we're fine all the while.
