And remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
When you're left for dead
In the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day

There's something there
But you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
Show that you care
And be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything, give back
Reciprocate her love

Lift up your head
And remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
When you're left for dead
In the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything, give back
Reciprocate her love

There's something there
But you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
Show that you care
And be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day
