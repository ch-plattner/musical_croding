
I look high, i look low,
I'm lookin' ev'rywhere i go,
Lookin' for a home in the heart of the country.

I'm gonna move, i'm gonna go,
I'm gonna tell ev'ryone i know,
Lookin' for a home in the heart of the country.

Heart of the country where the holy people grow,
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow,
Wo, wo, wo.

Want a horse, i want a sheep,
I wanna get me a good night's sleep,
Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.

I'm gonna move, i'm gonna go,
I'm gonna tell ev'ryone i know,
Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.

Heart of the country where the holy people grow,
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow,
Wo, wo, wo.


Want a horse, i got a sheep,
I'm gonna get me a good night's sleep,
Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.

I'm gonna move, i'm gonna go,
Gonna tell ev'ryone i know, oo-oo-oo
In the heart of the country.

Heart of the country where the holy people grow,
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow,
Wo, wo, wo.
