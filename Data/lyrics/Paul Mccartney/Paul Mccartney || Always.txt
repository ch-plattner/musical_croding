Ev'rything went wrong
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while
I forgot to smile
Then I met you
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last

I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

Dreams will all come true
Growing old with you
And time will fly
Caring each day more
Than the day before
Till spring rolls by
Then when the springtme has gone
Then will my love linger on
