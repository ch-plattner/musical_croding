
I Can't Get Over Myself
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Just Can't Imagine Myself
Falling Head Over Heals In Love
But When I Saw You Last Night
I Knew For The First Time
That You Were The One I'd Been Dreaming Of
I Cant Get Over Myself
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Falling Into The Hands Of Love

But When I Saw You Last Night
I Knew For The First Time
That You Were The One I'd Been Dreaming Of
I Can't Get Over Myself
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Love Sweet Love

But When I Saw You Last Night
I Knew For The First Time
That You Were The One I'd Been Dreaming Of
I Can't Get Over Myself
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Falling Into The Hands Of Love
Love Sweet Love
