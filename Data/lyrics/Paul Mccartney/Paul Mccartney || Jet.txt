
Jet, Jet,
Jet, I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told them that you were going to be marrying soon
And jet I thought the only lonely place was on the moon

Jet Jet Jet
Jet was your father as bold as the sergeant major
How come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet
And jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette

Jet Jet Jet
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me
Ah Mater... much later

Jet
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette
Jet Jet
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me
Ah Mater... much later
Jet with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet I thought that the major was a little lady suffragette

Jet-Jet-Jet
And Jet you know I thought you was a little lady suffragette
Jet
A little lady
My little lady... yes
