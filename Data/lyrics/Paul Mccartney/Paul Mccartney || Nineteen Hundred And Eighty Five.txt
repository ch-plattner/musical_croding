
On no one left alive in 1985, will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine
'cos i got you
Oh i oh i
Well i just can't enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
Interlude

On my mama said the time would come
When i would find myself in love with you
I didn't think i never dreamed
That i would be around to see it all come true
Woh i oh i
Well i just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
