[Chorus:]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed

Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs
We would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home.

[Chorus:]
But they can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through does early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

Hair slicked back with vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We will the thrill to never stop

May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always comes to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration long may it last
May it come to you time and time again

Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Of Who did this and who did that
But as for me I don't see how they can remember
When they weren't where it was at

[Chorus:]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

I lived through those early days
I lived through those early days
