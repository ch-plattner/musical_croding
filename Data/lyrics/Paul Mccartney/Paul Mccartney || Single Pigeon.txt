
Single Pigeon Through The Railing
Did She Throw You Out
Sunday Morning Fight About Saturday Night

Single Seagull Gliding Over Regent's Park Canal
Do You Need A Pal For A Minute Or Two
You Do?
Me Too, Me Too, Me Too
I'm A Lot Like You
Me Too, Me Too, Me Too
I'm A Lot Like You

Did She! Turf You Out In The Cold Morning Rain Again
Me Too, Me Too, Me Too
I'm A Lot Like You
Me Too, Me Too, Me Too
I'm A Lot Like You

Sunday Morning Fight About Saturday Night
