So i sat in the attic, a piano up my nose,
And the wind played a dreadful cantata.
Sore was i from a crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato.

Ketchup,
Soup and puree,
Don't get left behind.
Ketchup,
Soup and puree,
Don't get left behind.

When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves and the veins.
My piano was boldly outspoken
In attempts to repeat this refrain.

So i stood with a knot in my stomach,
And i gazed at that terrible sight,
Of two young sters concealed in a barrel,
Suckin' monkberry moon delight,  ho!
Monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight.

Oh -
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

Well, i know my banana is older than the rest
And my hair is a tangled beretta. (beretta, beretta)
But i leave my pyjamas to billy budapest,
And i don't get the gist of your letter.

Catch up,
Catch some kittens,
Don't get left behind.
Catch up,
Catch kittens,
Don't get left behind.

Oh - monkberry moon delight, yeah,
Monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Monkberry moon delight, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Monkberry moon delight,
Oh, monkberry moon delight,
Oh, monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight, oh-oh,
Monkberry moon delight
Suckin' monkberry moon delight,

Monkberry moon delight,

Monkberry moon delight,

Monkberry moon delight,

Ah, monkberry moon delight, yeah, yeah,

Monkberry moon delight, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh....

Uh, monkberry moon delight.

"try some of this, honey!
"what is it?"

Monkberry moon delight, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah....
(ooh) monkberry moon delight,
Uh, monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight,
Monkberry moon delight, ...
