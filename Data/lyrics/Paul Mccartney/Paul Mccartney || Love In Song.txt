
My Heart Cries Out For Love
And All That Goes With Loving
Love In Song - Love In Song

My, You're So Fine
When Love Is Mine
I Can't Go Wrong,
Love In Song - Love In Song

I Can See The Places That
We Used To Go To Now
Happiness In The Homeland

Happiness In The Homeland

My Eye Cries Out
A Tear Still Born
Misunderstanding
Love In Song - Love In Song

I Can See The Places That
We Used To Go To Now
Happiness In The Homeland

Happiness In The Homeland

My, You're So Fine
When Love Is Mine
I Can't Go Wrong,
Love In Song - Love In Song - Love In Song.
