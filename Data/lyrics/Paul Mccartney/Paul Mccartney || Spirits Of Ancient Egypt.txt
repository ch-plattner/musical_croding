
You're My Baby And I Love You
You Can Take A Pound Of Love
And Cook It In The Stew . . . . .

When You've Finished Doing That
I Know What You'll Want To Do
'Cos You're My Baby And I Love You

I'm Your Baby -- Do You Love Me?
I Can Drive A Cadillac
Across The Irish Sea
But When I've Finished Doing That
I Know Where I'll Want To Be
'Cos I'm Your Baby, And You Love Me.

Spirits Of Ancient Egypt
Shadows Of Ancient Rome
Spirits Of Ancient Egypt
Hung On The Telly
Hung On The Telly
Hung On The Telephone . . . .

You're My Baby, I Know You Know
You Could Sell An Elevator
To Geronimo
And When You've Finished Doing That
I Know Where You'll Want To Go
'Cos You're My Baby, I Know You Know

Spirits Of Ancient Egypt
Echoes Of Sunken Spain
Spirits Of Ancient Egypt
Hung On The 'Phone
A-Hung On The 'Phone
A-Hung On The 'Phone
. . . . . Again . . . . .
