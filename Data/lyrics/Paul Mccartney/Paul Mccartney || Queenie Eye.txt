There were rules you never told me
Never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me
Didn't help me understand

But I had to get it worked out
Had nobody who could help
So that in the end it turned out
That I had to do it
By myself…

Life's a game
Rags and riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Difficult to know which way to turn

Lay the blame
On the snitches
Wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn

Queenie Eye, Queenie Eye
Who’s got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out that's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Play the game
Take your chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesn’t matter which of them you choose

Never blame
Circumstances
If romances
Seldom came
Never pick a fight you're gonna lose

Queenie Eye, Queenie Eye
Who’s got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

It's a long way, to the finish
When you've never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now I'm going back for more

Let's shout
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Hear the people shout
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, yeah

Here the people shout

Queenie Eye, Queenie Eye
Who’s got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Queenie Eye, Queenie Eye
Who’s got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
