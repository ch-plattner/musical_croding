Your day breaks,
Your mind aches,
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up,
She makes up,
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one,
A love that should have lasted years
You want her,
You need her,
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one,
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home,
She goes out,
She says that long ago she knew someone, but no ne's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks,
Your mind aches,
There will be times when all the things you said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one,
A love that should have lasted years
