Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

You came along
And made my life a song
One lucky day
You came along

Just in time
While I was searching for a rhyme
You came along
Then we were new

[Chorus:]
We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there's no guarantee
We got nothing to lose

Don't look at me
I can't deny the truth
It's plain to see
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

[Chorus]

Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

Then we were new
Now we are new
