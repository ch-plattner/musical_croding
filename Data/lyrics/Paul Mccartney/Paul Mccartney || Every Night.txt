Ev'ry night i just wanna go out,
Get out of my head.
Ev'ry day i don't wanna get up,
Get out of my bed.
Ev'ry night i want to play out
And ev'ry day i wanna do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
But tonight i just wanna stay in
And be with you-oo,
And be with you.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ev'ry day i lean on a lamp post,
I'm wasting my time.
Ev'ry night i lay on a pillow,
I'm resting my mind.
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
And ev'ry night that day is throuough.
But tonight i just wanna stay in
And be with you,
And be with you.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, believe me, momma.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, momma,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh........
