
Say You Don't Love Him, My Salamander.
Why Do You Need Him?
Oh No, Don't Answer, Oh No.

I'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.

Keeping Ahead Of The Rain On The Road,
Watching My Windscreen Wipers.
Radio Play Me A Danceable Ode,
Cattle Beware Of Snipers.

When Will You See Me, My Salamander?
Now Don't Try To Tell Me
Oh No, Don't Answer, Oh No.

L'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.

Hitting The Chisel And Making A Joint,
Glueing My Fingers Together.
Radio Play Me A Song With A Point,
Sailor Beware Of Weather.

L'm Getting Closer, My Salamander.
Well When Will We Be There?
Ah No, Don't Answer, Oh No.

L'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.
