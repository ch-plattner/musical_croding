
Listen to me, we can give it a try
I'll look you straight in the eye and pull you to me
What I'm gonna do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

Do you hear me, if you don't understand
I'll take a hold of you hand and pull you near me
What I'm gonna do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no

Come and feel it, we can give it a go
But if you'd rather not go, I won't reveal it
'Cause what I'm gonna do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no

Be straight with me, yeah
Create with me, yeah
Don't wait for me to be steady
I've got no plan, yeah
But I'm you man, yeah
And I'll be there when you're ready

What I'm gonna do next I'll leave entirely to you imagination

I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no
