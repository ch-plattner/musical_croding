I Can't Get Over Your Love
No Matter How Hard Life Seems,
There's A Light In My Dreams
Thanks To You.
My Friends Keep Asking Me Why
There's Such A Smile On My Face,
There's A Home At My Place,
Thanks To You.
I Don't Want Anything From You,
Turn On Your Motor Of Love.
Motor Of Love, Motor Of Love.
Heavenly Father Look Down From Above,
I Can't Get Over Your Powerful
Motor Of Love.
I Can't Get Over Your Love
No Matter How Lost I Feel,
I Know My Love Is Real,
Thanks To You.
You Simply Reached Out Your Hand
And Touched Me Deep In My Soul,
I Came In Out Of The Cold,
Thanks To You.
I Won't Steal Anything From You,
You Give Me More Than Enough.
Motor Of Love, Motor Of Love.
Heavenly Father Look Down From Above,
I Can't Get Over Your Powerful
Motor Of Love.
There Was A Time
When I Was Down And Counted Out,
Well I Remember I Felt So Bad
I Nearly Threw Away,
Nearly Threw Away The Keys.
Motor Of Love, Motor Of Love.
Heavenly Father Look Down From Above,
Motor Of Love, Motor Of Love.
Heavenly Father Look Down From Above,
I Can't Get Over Your Powerful
Motor Of Love.
