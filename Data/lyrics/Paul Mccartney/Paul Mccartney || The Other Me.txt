I Know I Was A Crazy Fool
For Treating You The Way I Did
But Something Took Hold Of Me
And I Acted Like A Dustbin Lid

I Didn't Give Second Though
To What The Consequence Might Be
I Really Wouldn't Be Surprised
If You Were Trying To Find Another Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule

I Know It Doesn't Take A Lot
To Have A Little Self-Control
But Every Time That I Forgot
Well I Landed In Another Hole

But Everytime You Pull Me Out
I Find It Harder Not To See
That We Can Build A Better Life
If I Can Try To Find The Other Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule

But If I Ever Hurt You
Well You Know That It's Not Real
It's No Easy Living By Yourself
So Imagine How I Feel

I Wish That I Could Take It Back
I'd Like To Make A Different Mood
And If You Let Me Try Again
I'll Have A Better Attitude

Well I Know That One And One Make Two
And That's What I Want Us To Be
I Really Would Appreciate It
If You'd Help Me Find The Other Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule
