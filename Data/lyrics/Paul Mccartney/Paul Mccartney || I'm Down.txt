You don't cry cos you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same old thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down.
Waaaao! Baby I'm down

Oh baby you know I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh yes I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down on the ground (I'm really down)
Ahhhh! Down (I'm really down)
Oh baby I'm upside down, a yea yea yea yea yea
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm feeling upside down (I'm really down)
Ooo! I'm down (I'm really down)
Baby I'm down yea
Oh baby I'm down yea
Baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well baby baby baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby I'm down
I'm down, down, down
