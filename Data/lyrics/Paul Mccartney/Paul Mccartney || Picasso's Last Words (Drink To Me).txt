The grand old painter died last night
His paintings on the wall
Before he went he bade us well
And said goodnight to us all.
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know i can't drink any more
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know i can't drink any more

3 o'clock in the morning
I'm getting ready for bed
It came without a warning
But i'll be waiting for you baby
I'll be waiting for you there

So drink to me drink to my health
You know i can't drink any more
Drink to me drink to my health
You know i can't drink any more

French interlude

Temp change

Jet... drink to me

Drunken chorus

French (tempo) drink to me... ho hey ho
