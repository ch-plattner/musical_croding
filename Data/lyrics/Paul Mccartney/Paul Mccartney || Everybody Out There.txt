
Hey, everybody out there
You know what it's like
If you haven't got a life
When you haven't got a life

Hey, do you want to make a difference?
Well, stand in the line
If you haven't got the time
I can give you some of mine

There, but for the Grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
There, but for the Grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, I was trying to remember
How bad it was then
When you didn't have a friend
When you didn't have a friend

Hey, everybody out there (oh oh oh oh)
Everybody out there
Hey, everybody out there (oh oh oh oh)
Everybody out there

There, but for the Grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
Remember, there but for the Grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

Hey, everybody out there...
