We're so sorry if we caused you any pain.
We're so sorry, uncle albert,
But there's no one left at home
And i believe i'm gonna rain.

We're so sorry but we haven't heard a thing all day,
We're so sorry, uncle albert,
But if anything should happen
We'll be sure to give a ring.

"we're so sorry, uncle albert,
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day.
We're so sorry, uncle albert,
But the kettle's on the boil
And we're so eas'ly called away."

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
Doo-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
Uh-uh -

Hands across the water,  heads across the sky,
Hands across the water,  heads across the sky.

Admiral halsey notified me,
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea.
I had another look and i had a cup of tea and a butter pie.


"couldn't put it in something else
So i pulled it in the pie, alright!"

Hands across the water,  heads across the sky,
Hands across the water, heads across the sky.

Live a little, be a gypsy, get around,
Get your feet up off the ground,
Live a little, get around.

Live a little, be a gypsy, get around,
Get your feet up off the ground,
Live a little, get around.

Hands across the water, heads across the sky,
Hands across the water, heads across the sky.
