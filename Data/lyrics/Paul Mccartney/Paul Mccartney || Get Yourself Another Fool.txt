
At last I've wake up to see what you've done
All I can do is pack up and run
Now I know the rules, find yourself another fool

You said that you loved me, I was yours to command
Your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand
You played me for a fool, find yourself another fool

And now, now that we're through
You say, you wished you'd be true
Oh, but deep down in my heart
I know our love could never grow

And now, now that we're through
You say you wished you'd be true
Oh, but deep down in my heart
I know our love will never grow

At last I've awakened to see what you've done
All I can do is pack up and run
Now I know the rules, find yourself another fool

Now I know the rules, find yourself another fool
