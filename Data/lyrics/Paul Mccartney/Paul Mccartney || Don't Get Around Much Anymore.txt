
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.

Oh, darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo,
Why bring my memories.

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
It's awfully different without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.

Oh, darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo,
Why bring my memories.

Oooooh.
