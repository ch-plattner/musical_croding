I had a honey and I bet a grand,
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand.

I was talking to an Eskimo,
Said he was hopping for a fall of snow,
When up popped a sea lion ready to go.

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to junior's farm where I want to lay low,
Low life, high life, oh, let's go,
Take me down to junior's farm.

At the Houses of Parliament
ev'rybody's talking 'bout the President,
We all chip in for a bag of cement.

Olly Hardy should have had more sense,
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence,
All for the sake of a couple of pence.

I took my bag into a grocer's store,
The price is higher than the time before,
Old man asked me why is it more.

I said you should have seen me with the poker man,
I had a honey and I bet a grand,
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand.

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to junior's farm where I want to lay low,
Low life, high life, oh, let's go,
Take me down to junior's farm,
Let's go, let's go, down to junior's farm where I want to lay low.

Low life, high life, oh, let's go,
Take me down to junior's farm
Ev'rybody tag along.
Take me down to junior's farm.
