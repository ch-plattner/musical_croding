Well, When I Met You At The Station
You Were Standing With A Bootleg In Your Hand.
I Took You Back To My Little Place
For A Taste Of A Multicoloured Band.
We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi,
The Night Is Young.
She'll Be My Funky Little Mama,
Gonna Rock It And We've Only Just Begun.

We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi
With The Music On.
Won't Say Bye-Bye Bye-Bye Bye-Bye Bye-Bye
'Til The Night Is Gone.
I'm Gonna Do It To You, Gonna Do It,
Sweet Banana, You'll Never Give Up.
We're Gettin' Hi Hi Hi In The Midday Sun.

Well Well, Take Off Your Face,
Recover From The Trip You've Been On.
I Want To Lie On The Bed,
Get You Ready For My Polygon.
I'm Gonna Do It To You, Gonna Do It,
Sweet Banana, You've Never Been Done.
Yes, I Go Like A Rabbit, Gonna Grab It,
Gonna Do It 'Til The Night Is Done.

We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi With The Music On.
Won't Say Bye-Bye Bye-Bye Bye-Bye Bye-Bye
'Til The Night Is Gone.
I'm Gonna Do It To You, Gonna Do It,
Sweet Banana, You'll Never Give Up.
We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi, We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi,
We're Gonna Get Hi Hi Hi In The Midday Sun.
