Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart

Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
But here in my music I show you my heart

Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
When in the future we are apart
Music will show you my heart
If in the future we are apart
Music will show you my heart

Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
In the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart
Ecce Cor Meum

Music will show you my heart

Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace is only nature at rest
Love is our true nature
Love is All

Truth and nature bring us peace and love
Love is our true nature
Love is all
Love is our true nature
Love is All

Peace and Love are all we long for
Peace and Love
Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace and Love are always our true nature
Love is all

Human nature, our true nature
Love at peace with nature
Human nature, human nature

Therefore everyone of us
Has to find a strong foundation for a love
Help us find a strong foundation for our love

Although life sometimes is hard we still pull through
Without truth false shades nothing else remains
Without truth false shades nothing else remains
But still we are able to pull through
Even though we may have nothing else
Nothing ever remains
And then our positive feelings are threatened
Unless we can pull through
To the opposite side
Nothing else remains
