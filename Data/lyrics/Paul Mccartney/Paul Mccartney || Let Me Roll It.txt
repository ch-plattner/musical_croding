
You gave me something, i understand,
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand
I can't tell you how i feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me toll it to you

I want to tell you
And now's the time
I want to tell you that
You're going to be mine

I can't tell you how i feel
My heart is like a wheel.
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
