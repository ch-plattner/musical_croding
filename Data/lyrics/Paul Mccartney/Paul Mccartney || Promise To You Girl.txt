
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

[Chorus - harmonies]
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky

I gave my promise to you girl, I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side, We know how to change the world
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

Hey why wait another day, that won't get us anywhere
All the time, that ain't changed, to repair this brave old world
We'll be up, I gave my promise to you girl

[Chorus - harmonies]
Everything single second of our life
We can use to chase the clouds away

[Guitar Solo]

Well, there's no more barking up the tree, no more howling at the moon
Same old scene, you and I, diving for the deepest trust
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

[Chorus - guitar]

[Chorus - oh woh]

Looking through the backyard of my life
