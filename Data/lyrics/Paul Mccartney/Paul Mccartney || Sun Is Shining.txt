
Every morning
I get up
Look out the window
I get up
See the sunshine
Breathing down
Every morning comes around

Every morning
I get up
Look out the window
I get up
See the sunshine
Beating down
Every morning comes around

Waves are breaking
I'm in the water

The sun is shining down
The air is buzzing

Through the curtains
I look out
And the sun is melting the ground
When I'm walking through the town
Oh every morning, every morning
Through the curtains I look out
And the sun is melting the ground

Waves are breaking
I'm in the water

The sun is shining down
The air is buzzing
The sun is shining down
Mother nature's (the air is) buzzing

In the city
For the people
See the buildings
Crowd together

The sun is shining down
The air is shinning
Come on now
Let me know now
Tell me, tell me, tell me now

Listen to me
Can you hear me?
Ooo Hear me
