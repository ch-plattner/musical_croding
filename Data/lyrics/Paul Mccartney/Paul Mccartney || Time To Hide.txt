If I have to run, I'm not runnin' out on you.
If I have to shake a little sand out of my shoes,
I'm runnin' from the law, or they'll put me inside.

Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.

I've been on the run since the Good Lord knows when,
And the day I die,
I'll still be runnin' then,
Runnin' from the days when I would lay me down and cry.

Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.

Will I love you tomorrow?
Yes, I will; my love,
Oh yes I will, my love.

Will I beg, steal or borrow?
Yes, I will; my love,
Oh yes I will, my love.

To spend a little time happy to be by your side.
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.

If I have to run, I'm not runnin' out on you.
If I have to shake a little sand out of my shoes,
I'm runnin' from the law, or they'll put me inside.

Baby, won't you let me have a little time,
Baby, won't you let me have a little time,
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide.
