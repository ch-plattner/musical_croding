Won't You Come Out Tonight
When The Time Is Right
Oh Will You Fight That Feeling In Your Heart
Don't You Know That Inside
There's A Love You Can't Hide
So Why Do You Fight That Feeling In Your Heart

Don't You Know That Inside
There's A Love You Can't Hide
So Why Do You Fight That Feeling In Your Heart
