
A love so warm and beautiful
stands when time itself is falling,
A love so warm and beautiful
never fades away.

Love, faith and hope are beautiful
when your world is touched by sadness,
To each his own is wonderful,
love will never die.

Sunlight's morning glory
tells the story of our love,
Moonlight on the water
brings me in spiration ever after.

A love so warm and beautiful
stands when time itself is calling,
A love so warm and beautiful
never fades away,
never fades away.
