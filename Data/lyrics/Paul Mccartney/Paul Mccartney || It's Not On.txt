
Take your hand off my knee, young man.
Said the lady in green
I don't care to come in between you and your young woman
It's just not done

Couldn't we pass up?
Couldn't we fold?
Aren't certain stories best left untold?
Some things like buttons are best left undone
It's not on

Arnie Pupe
is normal type
with an average job
But his prospects will never be great
While bosses underestimate his value
Annie says

Irene E is his fiancee
And she'd hate to disagree
But the company she thinks is fair
Annie never does get anywhere

Take your feet off my desk, young man
Said the chauffeur in gray
My green woman has been to seen me
She's retreating from your advance

Wouldn't you join us?
When can you start up as a driver looking the part?
Hang on says Arnie
This just isn't done
It's not on, It's not on, It's not on
Hang on says Arnie
This just isn't done

Couldn't we pass up?
Couldn't we fold?
Aren't certain stories best left untold?
Some things like buttons are best left undone
It's not on, It's not on, It's not on
Some things like buttons are best left undone

It's not on
