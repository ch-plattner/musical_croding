
This is the story of a boy named ted,
If his mother said, "ted, be good."
He would.

She told him tales about his soldier dad,
But it made her sad, then she'd cry.
Oh my.

Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good,
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head,
He said:

"mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here,
Taking good care of you.
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here,
Teddy's gonna see you through."

Then came the day she found herself a man,
Teddy turned and ran, far away,
Ok

He couldn't stand to see his mother in love
With another man, he didn't know.
Oh no.

He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head,
He said:

"mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here,
Taking good care of you.
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here,
Teddy's gonna see you through."

She said:

"teddy don't worry, now mummy is here,
Taking good care of you.
Teddy don't worry, your mummy is here,
Mummy's gonna see you through."

Ooh -
Ah -ooh

This is the story of a boy named ted,
If his mother said, "ted, be good."
He would.
