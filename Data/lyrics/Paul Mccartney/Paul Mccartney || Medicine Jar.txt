
What's Wrong With You?
I Wish I Knew
You Say Time And Tell
I Hope That's True
There's More To Life Than Blues And Reds
I Say, I Know How You Feel,
Now Your Friends Are Dead.

Dead On Your Feet, You Won't Get Far
If You Keep On Sticking Your Hand
In The Medicine Jar.

Now Don't Give Up
Whatever You Do
You Say Time Will Tell
I Hope That's True
If You Go Down And Lose Your Head
I Say, I Know How You Feel
Now Your Friends Are Dead.

Dead On Your Feet, You Won't Get Far
If You Keep On Sticking Your Hand
In The Medicine Jar.

Dead On Your Feet . . . . .

What Can I Do?
I Can't Let Go
You Say Time Will Heal
But Very Slow
So Don't Forget The Things You Said
I Say I Know How You Feel
Now Your Friends Are Dead.

Dead On Your Feet, You Won't Get Far
If You Keep On Sticking Your Hand
In The Medicine Jar.
