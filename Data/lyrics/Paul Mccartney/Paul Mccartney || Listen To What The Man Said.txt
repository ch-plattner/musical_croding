
Any Time, Any Day
You Can Hear The People Say,
But He Wont Mind, Well, I Don't Know
But I Say Love Is Kind

Soldier Boy Kisses Girl
Leaves Behind A Tragic World
But He Wont Mind, He's In Love
And He Says Love Is Fine

Oh - Yes, Indeed We Know
That People Will Find A Way To Go
No Matter What The Man Said
And Love Is Fine For All We Know
For All We Know, Our Love Will Grow
- That's What The Man Said
So Won't You Listen To What The Man Said

He Said . . . . .

Oh - Yes, Indeed We Know
That People Will Find A Way To Go . . .

Oh - Yes, Indeed We Know
That People Will Find A Way To Go . . .
Etc. Etc.
