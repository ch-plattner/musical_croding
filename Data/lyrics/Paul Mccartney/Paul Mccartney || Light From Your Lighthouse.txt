When the sky is filled up
With stones and heavy rain
And trouble starts sliding
Across the way
It's hard for me to see
Which road I've got to take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

And when the light is filled up
With storms and heavy rain
And trouble comes sliding
Across my mind
It's hard for me to see
Which road I've got to take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
