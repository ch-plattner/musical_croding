
I should have kissed you
One last time
I would have held you
So much longer if I had known
It would be the last time

If I could forget you
Make all these memories
Fade to grey
I'd rather not remember what I foolishly traded

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
I'm the fool, yeah
I'm the fool
I think I meant I love you
When I said that I don't care
I wish I were just lonely instead

I should have loved you
More than I did
Living without you
With your ghost, and your voice
Always in my head

Yeah I couldn't see you
And now I see you everyday
But not with me
It seems real nice
She makes you smile
Like you used to smile at me

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
I'm the fool, yeah
I'm the fool
I think I meant I love you
When I said that I don't care
I wish I were just lonely instead, oh

You were right
I'm lying here
Wishing you were with me
Hoping that you might be
Missing me
Cause I can't seem to fight it honey
Wish I could erase every part of you in me

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
I'm the fool, yeah
I'm the fool
I think I meant I love you
When I said that I don't care
I wish I were just lonely instead, oh

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
I'm the fool, yeah
I'm the fool
I think I meant I love you
When I said that I don't care
I wish I were just lonely instead
Yeah, I wish I could be lonely instead
