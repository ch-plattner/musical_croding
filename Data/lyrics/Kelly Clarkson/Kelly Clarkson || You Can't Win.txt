If you go, they'll say you're following
If you don't, then you're too good for them
If you smile, you must be ignorant
If you don't, what's your problem?
If you're down, so ungrateful
And if you're happy, why so selfish?
And, you can't win
No, you can't win, no

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster
Everytime you try to fly
You end up falling out of line, oh
You can't can't win, no

If you're thin, poor little walking disease
If you're not, they're all screaming obese
If you're straight, why aren't you married yet?
If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?
If it's wrong, you're knowing it
If it's right, you'll always miss
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster
Everytime you try to fly
You end up falling out of line, oh
You can't can't win, no

And you try, you try so hard
But it's wearing on your heart
And you play, you play the game
But you pay, you pay for it
You can't win, no
You can't win no

If you speak, you'll only piss 'em off
If you don't, you're another robot
If you stop, they'll just say you quit
If you don't, you might lose your shit
You can't win, no
You can't win, no
You can't win, nooo

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster
Everytime you try to fly
You end up falling out of line, oh
You can't can't win, no

I can't win

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster
Everytime you try to fly
You end up falling out of line, oh
You can't can't win, no
