
I think you've touched my hand 
Or maybe hurt me again 
What did you say that made me blush 
I think you laughed at me 
First dates are always fun 
I think that when I fell in love 

First kiss first moment that I knew 
First time you said I love you 
First day I started to forget 
I still have all your pictures 
Sometimes I do remember 
You come and go like all the rest 

It's been so long since i left 
I cant remember my way back 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 
No where to go walkin' alone 
Without your love I have no home 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 

Sometimes I get a glance of 
You and me and we're dancin' 
As if things they never change 
You hold me closer to you 
I watch you fade and soon you 
You just, you slip away 

Cause, It's been so long since I left 
I cant remember my way back 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 
No where to go walkin' alone 
Without your love I have no home 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 

(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah) 
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah) 
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhhh) 

It's been so long since I left 
I cant remember my way back 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 
No where to go walkin' alone 
Without your love I have no home 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 

Cause, its been so long since I left 
I cant remember my way back 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost 
No where to go walkin' alone 
Without your love I have no home 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
