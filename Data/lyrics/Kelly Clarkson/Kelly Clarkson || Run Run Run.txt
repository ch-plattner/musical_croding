I wonder how your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes, there's nothing left to heal
I'm alone but I know everything you feel

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Tell me how you closed the door
Knowin' nobody could love you more
Tellin' all your friends that this love
Was just made for bleedin'
Hung up underwater but still we keep on
Tryin' to breath in

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our lust for fightin'
Tied up in silence

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our lust for fightin'
Tied up in silence
