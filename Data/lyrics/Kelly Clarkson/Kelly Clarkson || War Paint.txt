
Face to face but miles away
Building trenches out of empty spaces
Lay here next to me
End close the distance in between

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're trying to hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

Scar to scar, I wanna know
Every story that you've never told
Don't shut me out, don't think too much
Don't keep that barricade up

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're trying to hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

So hold me close and kiss my skin
Don't be afraid, let me in
I'll hold you close and take your hand to my heart
Here I am, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint
Our war paint
