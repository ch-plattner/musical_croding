
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?

'Cause the lights are on
But I'm never home
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude
'Cause I forgive you

[chorus]
I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living a dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling in on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?
If I hate you what does that do?
So I breathe in and I count to 10

'Cause the lights are on
And I'm coming home
Yes, I am back with a new heart in my hand
'Cause I forgive you

[repeat chorus]

I forgive you
For every times that I cried
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me
That's alright
Yeah, I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

[repeat chorus]
