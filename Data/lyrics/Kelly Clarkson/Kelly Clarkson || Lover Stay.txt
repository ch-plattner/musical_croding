I know that I hurt you, 
with these words that, 
just keep slipping from my tongue, 
(from my tongue) 
I know I'll desert you before you, 
can when I think you'll run, 
before you run, 

Love, it's complicated, 
My heart, it hesitates, 
You know love seems far and distant, 
for some, for some, 
Don't let go, I'm almost there, 
Don't say things you can't take back, 

Don't you say, don't you say, 
That you're walking away from me, 
Lover stay, lover stay, 
I can't help my mind to play, 
I won't change if you won't change, 
My heart breaks when you go away, 
So lover stay, lover stay 
With me... (Oh Oh) 

I know I'm not thick skin, 
where it holds onto your heart, 
But I am trying, I am trying, 
Letting go has never, 
been to easy for the lonely, 
but in time, but in time, 

Love, it takes a breath away, 
Love, it leaves no choice to make, 
Love means everything for some (for some), 
I will let you in, but 
please, when I do, 
remember one thing, 

Don't you say, don't you say, 
That you're walking away from me, 
Lover stay, lover stay, 
I can't help my mind to play, 
I won't change if you won't change, 
My heart breaks when you go away, 
So lover stay, lover stay 
With me... (Oh Oh)
