Everybody's happy
Snow is falling down
Prayers are being answered
Miracles all around

From afar I've loved you
But never let it show
And every year another
December comes and goes

Always watching
Never reaching

But this Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yeah
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Blue is where I've been
Green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me
That mistletoe's for two

So I found a color
That only tells the truth
That paints a picture
Of how I feel for you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yeah
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I'll never feel you
If I don't tell you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yeah
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
