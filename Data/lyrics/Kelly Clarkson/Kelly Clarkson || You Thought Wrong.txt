
I see how your trying to weasel
your way in
boy i know how you manueveur
with your confusion

you tell me that i'm your only 
and how bad that you want me
then why are you so shady
if i'm supposed to be your lady

why should I believe anything you say
and how could you shame me that way

tell me where where did you get the nerve
to even think that you you could
play me wrong

you thought we didn't know
you thought we were in the dark
but boy your covers blown
cause we both know now

you thought you had us fooled
at your beckon call 
but now who's the joke
and look who's laughing now

now your trying to use us against one another
but it won't work

i see right though your game boy
and i know exactly what i'm in for
you tried to deny all your actions 
for once in your life be a real man
at least give me the proper respect
of the truth i already know you did it

why should I believe anyting you say
and how could you shame me that way

tell me where did you get the nerve
to even think that you could
play me wrong

you thought we didn't know
you thought we were in the dark
but boy your covers blown
cause we both know now

you thought you had us fooled
at your beckon call
but now who's the joke
and look who's laughing now

I see right through you baby 
tryin' to tell me you want me
why don't you get it through your thick head
cause i've seen this game before
and i'm not showing you the door so
SHUT YOUR MOUTH
i'm not trying to hear your lies 
no not again
sorry you couldn't be a better man

you thought we didn't know
you thought we were in the dark
but boy your covers blown
cause we both know now

you thought you had us fooled
at your beckon call
but now who's the joke
and look who's laughing now
Guess you thought wrong 
look who's laughing now
You stupid

[Laughter, then end]
