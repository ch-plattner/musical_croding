
Everybody says you're no good for me
Nothin' but trouble is what you bring
Everybody thinks you're out to get me
Helpless little fool they must think I am

Everybody thinks that we're both crazy
Well it's just my luck

[CHORUS:]
Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I.. I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts
My ways
I guess not today

Everybody says I'm no good for you
Nothin' but trouble is what I bring
Everybody thinks I'm out to get you
Well it's just my luck

[CHORUS:]
Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I.. I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted heart
My ways
I guess not today

You look like a mess
I'd like to know
How 'bout movin' just a little closer
I think maybe one day I..
I could love you

[CHORUS:]
Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I.. I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts
My ways
I guess not today

Not today
I guess not.. today
Not today
Not today
