
You look at me,
Like you always do.
You don’t have a clue.
You smile at me,
You hug me,
But you don’t know I want you.
You play with me,
You flirt with me,
You tell me all your secrets.
I’m always the one you run to, 
but to you I’m just your friend.

Don’t say I love you,
Don’t say you need me,
Don’t say I trust you,
My heart cant take it.
Don’t say you want me,
Don’t say you miss me,
Don’t hurt me.
Don’t say you love me.

Ooooh ooooh no... no.. nooo.

I try my best to rid these thoughts,
Of you and I it’s so hard.
When come to me, 
I fall back on my knees.
I learned to hate love.
You kiss me on the cheek,
You say you’d never make it without me.
It’s getting harder everyday.
Please don’t say to me,

Don’t say I love you,
Don’t say you need me,
Don’t say I trust you,
My heart can’t take it.
Don’t say you want me,
Don’t say you miss me,

Don’t hurt me.
Don’t say you love me.

Don’t say you love me.
Don’t say you love me.
Don’t say you love me.
Don’t say you love me.

My heart cant take it.
I love you so much.
But you don’t see me.
I hate love.

Don’t say I love you,
Don’t say you need me,
Don’t say I trust you,
Unless you mean it.
Don’t say you want me,
Don’t say you need me,
Don’t hurt me.
No...

Don’t say I love you,
Don’t say you need me,
Don’t say I trust you,
My heart cant take it.
Don’t say you want me,
Don’t say you miss me,
Don’t hurt me.
Don’t say you love me.
