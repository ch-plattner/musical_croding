I'm on the tightrope, you've got your reasons
When did it get so hard to breathe?
Hot in the spotlight, I'm feelin' so tired
Your hands are burned from holdin' me
And maybe you and I will fall in time
Eventually
Maybe we'll both die trying
But I can't bring myself to leave
'Cause I've looked

And I ain't seen nothin' like you
The way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe
Just to stumble into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete

You're on the tightrope, I've got my reasons
How did we get so tangled?
You turn, I stay straight, I bend as you break
We're so messed up, but I know
That you and I will fall in time, eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothin' like you
The way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe
Just to stumble into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete

Oh, you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothin' like you
The way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe
Just to stumble into your good grace
And I, I still can't compete
