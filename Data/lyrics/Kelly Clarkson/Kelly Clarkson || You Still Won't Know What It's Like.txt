
When you hit the bottom 
When you're left with nothing 
When you can't tell the difference, yeah 
You still won't know what it's like 

When you think you're drowning 
When it's overwhelming 
When you can't get past it, yeah 
You still won't know what it's like 
What it's like 

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen 
You haven't lived enough to know what it means 
To feel the pain in love turned cold 
To taste the year before it's over 

When your body's frozen 
And you can trust no one 
When you think you're lonely, yeah 
You still won't know what it's like 

When you feel the knife stick 
You just can't take it 
When your heart is breaking 
You still won't know what it's like 
What it's like 

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen 
You haven't lived enough to know what it means 
To feel the pain in love turned cold 
To taste the end before it's over 

You don't know the first thing of suffering 
So before you start trading stocks for sympathies 
Take a look at what's left of me 
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me 

Every day I fight a war with God 
And every time I think I'm living a lie, 
No I'm not 

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen 
You haven't lived enough to know what it means 
To feel the pain in love turned cold 
To taste the year before it's over 

You don't know the first thing of suffering 
So before you start trading stock for sympathy 
Take a look at what's left of me 
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me 

You don't know the first thing of suffering 
So before you start trading stock for sympathy 
Take a look at what's left of me 
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me
