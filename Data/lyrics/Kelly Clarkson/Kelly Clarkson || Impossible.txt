
Spoke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinkin' 'bout it for a while
Yeah starting to think it's time I knee
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it's real
It's possible
You say

[Chorus]
Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
It's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change your mind so I pray
Breakin' down the walls
Do the impossible

Walkin' by myself I know 
This lonely road's becomin' my new home
But I don't stop, I just keep movin' on 
And on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes
I haven't cried in quite some time
Every day I fight it
You know it's possible
You say

[Chorus]

Can someone tell me why it's so hard takin' chances
You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more, yeah
I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes yeah
But I won't worry 'bout it anymore
It's impossible

[Chorus]

It's impossible to you
Not impossible for me
Not impossible for me

Spoke up and though it'd try
Try to step across the line
