I guess my silver lining is hidden from my sight
Cuz I cant see much reason to go on pretending
I guess I try to hard 
Pushed us too much too far
What can I say to change it
I'll never know cuz baby

Your not here 
He's not you 
And I'm too scared to even move
Ohh what am I gunna do
It's not fair she's not me
It's hard enough just to breath
I can't lose
I can't lose you

It's been to long since I've kissed your face
Yea I've been so lost since you went away
No I can't keep quiet any longer baby
I can't lose 
I can't lose you
It's hard enough that your not around
But I can't see you in another arms
Yea I know we said goodbye but now I know 
I can't lose
I can't lose you

I guess it's not surprising
Who wouldn't love your smile she
Doesn't know what she has
My love I need you back
Well I guess I'm way too late
My pride my foolish ways
Took you away my baby
What can I say to change this

Your not here 
He's not you 
And I'm too scared to even move
Ohh what am I gunna do
It's not fair she's not me
It's hard enough just to breath
I can't lose
I can't lose you

It's been to long since I've kissed your face
Yea I've been so lost since you went away
No I can't keep quiet any longer baby
I can't lose 
I can't lose you
It's hard enough that your not around
But I can't see you in another arms
Yea I know we said goodbye but now I know 
I can't lose
I can't lose you

I close my eyes and make believe
That it's not him it's you kissin me
I try to convince myself get through
But it's no use no use baby it's use

Your not here 
He's not you 
And I'm too scared to even move
Ohh what am I gunna do
It's not fair she's not me
It's hard enough just to breath
I can't lose
I can't lose you

It's been to long since I've kissed your face
Yea I've been so lost since you went away
No I can't keep quiet any longer baby
I can't lose 
I can't lose you
It's hard enough that your not around
But I can't see you in another arms
Yea I know we said goodbye but now I know 
I can't lose
I can't lose you

I can't lose you
Ohhhhh
I can't lose you
Ohhhhhh
I can't lose you
