Some days I barely miss you
Some days I'm almost alright
And some nights I turn to kiss you
But you're not beside my side
Got this same damn conversation playing over and over in my mind
In my mind

Yeah my heart is wet and heavy but my body's on the run
'Cause the night is gonna get me and it's only just begun
I keep living on the memory of you and me
You me in the sun, in the sun

No matter where you are a little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years we'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you in the blue, in the blue

Yeah I'm running from this city like a diamond in the sky
And I'm trying to count my blessings 'stead of all the tears I've cried
I keep driving in this darkness to get you to get you off my mind, off my mind
I'll start over in a new place, put my feet back on the ground
Can't believe the mess that I've made just trying to drown you out
Baby one day I won't miss you
I'll stop looking for you in the crowd, in the crowd

No matter where you are a little piece of my heart will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years we'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you in the blue, in the blue

I see your face in every stranger
Footsteps down the hall
Warm breath, back of my neck
Shadows on the wall
And your voice is loud as thunder hey
I can hear it crashing in my head, yeah

No matter where you are a little piece of my heart will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years we'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you in the blue, in the blue
I'll be forever with you in the blue, in the blue
