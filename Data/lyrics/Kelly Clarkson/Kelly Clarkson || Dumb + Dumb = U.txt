
Simple math: our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies, this time I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone

And I know I'm wrong sometimes, oh
But it ain't rocket science, no
And I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes
So now get out of my place
You say I'm crazy and that we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me?

And I know I'm wrong sometimes, oh
But it ain't rocket science, no
Yeah, I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

All of the promises flushed
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and then it leaves us
With nothing at all
No, nothing at all

You can stop wasting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure out
Dumb plus dumb equals you?
Equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

And I know I'm wrong sometimes
But it ain't rocket science, yeah
I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Simple math: our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies, this time I'm going out of my mind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you
