I been thinkin'
How you're wastin'
All that lovin' on someone else
I can't take it

I will make you
Forget all about the one I'll be replacin'
So just say it

I know you've been thinkin' 'bout it
I see you lookin' around
I will give you
What you're missin'
What you see in me when you think no one's watchin'

Don't wait too long
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on
Much longer

[CHORUS:]
Oh (don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You don't touch
You don't talk
You don't look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

Oh yeah, yeah

I don't care
What they say
I'll deal with anythin
If it gets you next to me

I don't want
Just a taste
I want you anytime I feel a little craving

I'm not that strong
I can't hold on

[CHORUS:]
Oh (don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

What are you hiding in your covers
Like to wait, little lover
What will you do when they discover your eyes on another?
Why you runnin' round in circles
Tryin' so hard to discourage
Tellin' secrets that'll surface
One way or another

[CHORUS:]
Oh, I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh, Oh, I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face

You never touch
You never talk to me
You never look me in the face

Your dirty little secret
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty, dirty secret
Na, na, na, na
Dirty
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty
