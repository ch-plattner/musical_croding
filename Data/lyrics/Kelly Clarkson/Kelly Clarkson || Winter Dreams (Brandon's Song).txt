Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
New love chase away my past
Nothing but the open road
Saddle up
Here we go...
1,2,3

First winter here in your arms
Flames rising as well fall like stars
Making angels in the snow
Warm, fuzzies, frozen toes...
Is this a dream?

Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream
Winter dream
Winter dream

Build a fire to escape the cold
Bing Crosby on the stereo
Tracing letters on my skin
Slowly starts sinkin' in...
You love me

Oh, Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter

Dream and dreams
While I'm wide awake
The tree, the lights
Stayin' up late
It's true...
I'm in love with you (Oh)

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream, dream
Winter dream

(Oh, Oh)
(Oh, Oh)
(Oh, Oh)
(Oh, Oh)
(Oh, Oh)
