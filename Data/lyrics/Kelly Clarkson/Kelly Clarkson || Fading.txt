
Running around
Trying to figure out, now
Where you put your smile down
You can't let them see you like this
Thinking what mask you're gonna front
You grab the nearest one
You take your place

Amongst these faceless others
Underneath the surface
Everything's so backwards
It's all a lie

[CHORUS:]
Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Don't move
Sit there in a trance
Do not make a sound
Fool, what were you thinking?
Fallen no one's gonna call
No hands were up at all
You're on your own again

Walls are closing in
You can't feel anything
Becoming one of them
Come back to me

[CHORUS:]
Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Fading, fading, fading
Fading, fading, fading

[CHORUS:]
Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading away

Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Fading, fading..
