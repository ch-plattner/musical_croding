
Just for now
Just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here,
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have had too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it
Can we settle down please
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Bite tongue
Deep breaths
Count to ten
Nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music
Better quick sharp remove it
Pour me another
Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me, get me outta here
Get me, get me outta here...

Just for now...
Please
