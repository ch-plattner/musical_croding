Oooh

I'm gettin' kinda close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose (he-ey-ey)
You've been hanging with me everyday (ay-ay)
Now your getting in my way-yeahh

I know you understand me
But don't you think that maybe
It's time to move on

What's up lonely
Seems your my only friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today

Just when I think that your gone
Your in the mirror looking back at me

So whats up lonely

Sometimes, i wish you weren't by my side,
can't you find another shoulder cause i
i wanna leave this broken heart behind, 
we're both waisten to much time

Find someone else to rain on,
i'm really gettin tired of singin this sad song

whats up lonely, seems your my only
friend who wants to 
share my pain
Tell me heartache
whats it gonna take
for you to leave me alone today

just when i think that your gone
your in the mirror lookin back at me
so whats up lonely

don't wanna give you a reason, to hang around anymore
you won't be hurtin my feelins
if you find another broken heart you can lean on

Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
just leave me alone

What's up lonely
Seems you're my only friend
Who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take?
For you to leave me alone today
Just when i think that you're gone, yea
You're in the mirror lookin back at me
So what's up lonely?

Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Hey, yea, hey

What's up lonely
Seems you're my only friend
Who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take?
For you to leave me alone today
Just when i think that you're gone, yea
You're in the mirror lookin back at me
So what's up lonely?
