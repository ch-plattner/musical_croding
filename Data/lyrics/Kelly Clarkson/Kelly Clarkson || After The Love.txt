
My tired eyes are begging for release
For sleep
I always seem to want the one who's just a little
Out of reach
Maybe I just can't love
What I can keep
My love, you are
The best friend that I'll ever have

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

His lips try not to tremble
When he speaks
My tired breath falls so heavy
On his cheek
But I'll never know just what I have
Unless I leave
Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again
Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love
