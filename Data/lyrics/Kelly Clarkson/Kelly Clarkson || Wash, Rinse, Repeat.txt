I can't take the pressure of new
Gimme old
Rip it off
Lets see if it sticks to the wall again
They're too dumb to see, see the truth
Give it to em
They will never notice
So what's stop, stop, stopping us
Does it sound familiar?
Does it linger in your ear?
Like something you remember from just last year
Like sweet little lullabies in your ear
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Hi, I'm originality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bitch)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (We love ??)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Hi, my name is ... and I'm here to run everything
Spreading like a cancer I will die and take you all with me
Let you have a little bit when secretly I'm waiting to rip the rug from underneath
Can't believe you fell for it
Music from the past, from the present,
Well, just last week
We will change a note and get away with it (wait and see)
Just when you think that we've changed
Like an addict we sweep right back in with a dose of reality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bitch)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (We love ??)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing, over and over
Expecting a different result
I'm insane (I'm insane)
Just wash, rinse, and repeat

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bitch)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (We love ??)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, repeat
You love this song (everybody can do it)
This song is the most amazing song that you have ever heard (it's easy)
(Anybody can do it, and I mean anybody)

This song is completely different from that other song, that sounds exactly the same!

Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is
