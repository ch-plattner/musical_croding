
Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental
Won't stay, won't last when it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight
Can't breath, can't sleep
Need some medication
I've kissed goodbye to my reservations
I know there's other fish out in the seas
Not for me
I want you

[Chorus]
If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then only damage has been done, baby
We can break these rules 
If you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you will lose
If I can't have you
If I can't have you

Heartbeat cold sweat
Thoughts slippin' under
Can't fight no threat
'Cause there's just no use
One look, no hesitation I'm slipping into you
Forgive these eyes, these lips you're tastin'
No time to waste on an invitation
My shame, my self-control has suffered enough
And everybody wants to be loved

[Chorus]

If I can't have you
If I can't have you
I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer
They say perfection's always right around the corner
Could be true
But if I can't have you

[Chorus]

If I can't have you
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
Think of all the love that you will lose
If I can't have you
