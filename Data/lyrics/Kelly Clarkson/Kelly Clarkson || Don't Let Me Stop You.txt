
I used to be a little bit shy
I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my 
Emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait
Tonight I feel a little but brave
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are

[Pre-Chorus]
This is gonna sound kind of silly
But I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me
You kept both eyes open
Baby can you tell me what does that mean
If you're looking over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

[Chorus]
Don't let me stop you
From doing what you want to do
You don't want to stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance get over you
Don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me
If it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

A lot of things I can take
Got a high threshold for pain
But let's get one thing straight
I'm not down to share you with anyone
If that's not what you're looking for
Nice knowing you but there's the door
'Cause I know that I could find someone
Who'll give me what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
This is gonna sound kind of silly
If you're looking over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

[Chorus]

Even if I end up broken hearted
I won't lie, I don't wanna hear your goodbye
But either way I'll be alright

[Chorus]
