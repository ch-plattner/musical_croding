
Roll over baby
The time has come
To make a little bit more room
I’ve hung around you
It’s getting tough
I think I’m gonna break down soon
Cuz I remember
Crying in the park
It was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky

So go on
And sleep darlin
Why don’t you pretend we were just a dream
It’s cool baby
It doesn’t matter anyway
Well I’m so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel
Don’t make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can’t you see me
I’m such a mess
Trying hard to find my way
Do you remember wasting all the time
We were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line,
We were all right

So go on
And sleep darlin
Why don’t you pretend we were just a dream
It’s cool baby
It doesn’t matter anyway
Well I’m so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train

Oh why'd that train just pass us by
Didn’t anyone see we were stuck at the light
And we would've made it on time

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

So sleep darlin
Why don’t you pretend we were just a dream
It’s cool baby
It doesn’t matter anyway
Well I’m so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
And sleep darlin
Why don’t you pretend we were just a dream
It’s cool baby
It doesn’t matter anyway
Well I’m so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train
