
I was standin' with my friend when I saw you walkin' in
And my heart started skippin' a beat
I was tryin' to play it cool but I knew it was true
That nobody would ever compete

Well first comes love and then comes
First date first kiss, we were checkin' off the list
Then you were gettin' down on your knee
And you didn't have to guess, it was always a yes
Now there's two less fish in the sea

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
Oh baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up

Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
And the chairs lined up in the yard
The I do's and the kisses
From a miss to a misses
Can't wait for forever to start

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
So baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up

Tie it up
Invite the town
Let's raise a glass and lock it down
Tie it up
Forever bound
Cause I'm fit to be tied down

When mama's kickin' off her shoes
And daddy's spinnin' from the booze
And the last song is finally sung
We can run to the room
Kickstart the honeymoon
Don't it sound like a whole lotta fun?

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
So baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up
Tie it up
Tie it up
