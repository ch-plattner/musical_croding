
Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone

I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes,now get out of my place
You say I'm crazy, now we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me?

I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
Yeah I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

All of your promises plus
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and let it leaves us
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all

You can stop wasting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure it out
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Equals you, yeah

I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
Yeah I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
And I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
