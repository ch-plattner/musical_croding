
Saw it with my naked eye 
Seeing is believing 
Funny when you realize 
You gotta stop feeling 
Watched you leave my side 
When it really matters 
Watched your straight face lie 
Saying it'll be alright, it's alright 

Can't take back what you can't change 
Can't fix whats more than broken 
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame 
I saw it with my naked eye 
My naked eye 

Saw it with my naked eye 
I'm losing a battle 
Were you ever on my side 
It's never been settled 
Watched you fall way side when it really mattered ?? 
What you waste my heart you know it's not alright alright 

Can't take back what you can't change 
Can't fix what's more than broken 
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame 
I saw it with my naked eye 
My naked eye 

Hands are red (it's too late now) 
Words so cheap (it's too late now) 
Broken promises (it's too late now) 
Breaking me 

Can't take back what you can't change 
Can't fix whats more than broken 
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame 
I saw it with my naked eye 
My naked eye 
My naked eye 
My naked eye
