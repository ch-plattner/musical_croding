
I am a woman
Cut in two
By ambitious pride
Stuck in my ways
Between you and my other life

Now I have been around enough to know when love has ended
But I believe that you and I deserve to be extended

So why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
'Cause we both know
I can't stop myself

Our empty house
You occupy
When I'm far away
Heavier hearts won't justify
Why I'm gone today

Now I have hung a cloud above our lives from always leaving
Figured you would at least make me give a better reason

So why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
Because we both know
I can't stop myself

In the early mornings when I'm up before dawn
You say "why don't you stay" but you keep sleeping on
Maybe you're just used to me being gone
Cause if you know that I don't want to go

Then why don't you try
Oh yeah
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
'Cause we both know,
I can't stop myself

Why don't you
Why don't you try
When it's time to go, oh
'Cause I don't want to have to go 
And be the one to leave you holding on alone
But this, this is my goodbye

So why don't you try
Oh oh, oh
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you try
