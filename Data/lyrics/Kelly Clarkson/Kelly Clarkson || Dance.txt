Everything about you just makes me wanna
Everytime I see you I just wanna
If you only knew how much I 
You'd reconsider foolin with me
If I told you that I wanna
How fast would you run I wonder
You will know the sound thats comin
I'm playin this song just special for ya

Red botton red botton
In my hand
Make them dance make them dance

Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
Too much feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh
Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
No more feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh

Haha
Haha
Everytime you speak I wanna
Give you a little taste I'm gunna
You will know the sound it's comin
The tables crashin down on ya

Triger happy trigger happy
With my hands
Make them dance make them dance

Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
Too much feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh
Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
No more feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh

Lookin closer at the fine print here
Those chains are strings and now my hearts black tears

Now you can
Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
Too much feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh
Dance dance dance for me
'at a boy 'at a boy
So so pretty
Dance dance entertain me
No more feelin like I gotta 
Ahhhh
