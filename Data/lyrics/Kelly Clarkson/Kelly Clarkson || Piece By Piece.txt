And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn't want to

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old and you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money, he takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could... stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you want to come back
But your love, it isn't free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed so I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old and you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money, he takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could... stay

Piece by piece [x6]

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm going to put her first
And you know, he'll never walk away,
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things, he'll love her
And piece by piece, he'll restore my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

Piece by piece [x3]
