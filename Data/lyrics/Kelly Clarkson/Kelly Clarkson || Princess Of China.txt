
Once upon a time, somebody ran,
Somebody ran away saying "Fast as I can,
I got to go, I got to go"
Once upon a time, we fell apart,
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart,
Oh whoa, oh whoa

Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh 

Once upon a time, we were burning bright,
Now all we ever seem to do is fight,
On and on, and on and on and on
Once upon a time, on the same side,
Once upon a time, on the same side,
In the same game
So why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame?

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no,
You let me go,
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no,
You let me go,

You stole my star,
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You stole my star
La la la la la la

Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh [x2]

'Cause you really hurt me,
Yeah, you really hurt me,
Yeah, you really hurt me,
Yeah, you really hurt me,
'Cause you really hurt me, oh
Yeah, you really hurt me, oh
Yeah, you really hurt me, yeah
Yeah, you really hurt me
