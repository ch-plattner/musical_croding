Prayed for an angel
To come in the night
Shine some sweet light on me
Found only strangers 
Then you came to me

Just when i givin up
You gave me love
My world was tumblin down
You turned it around, baby

You're some kind of miracle
Ohhhhhh, You, You, Youuuuu are
You're a miracle to me

Sweet revelation
That look in your eyes
Your touch in the night
I found the sweetest salvation
In your arms baby

When there's no mornin sun
Your tender love
Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done baby

You, you're some kind of miracle
Ohh, you, you, you are
You're a miracle to me

You brought joy to my heart
I found love in your arms
See what you've done to me
You set my soul so free
You came and you gave me the love that i need

Oh you, you're some kind of miracle
You, you are
You're a miracle
A miracle to me
Baby you are
Ohh, a miracle to me
