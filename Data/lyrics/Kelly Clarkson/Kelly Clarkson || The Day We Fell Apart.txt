So ...
Whoooooaa oooh
Hmmmm yeaaah

What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery!
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?
Tell me what's this desperation
Cause I don't recognize this changed
I think I made a bad mistake

[Chorus]
Cause once I ran away
I love you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I could take
I love you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, part, part)

Now everything is coming undone
Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I love you since the day
The day we fell apart
Whoooo aaaaah

I must admit the grass is so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I noticed now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think I like
Tell me what's this desperation
Cause I don't recognize he's changed
I think I made a bad mistake

[Chorus]
Cause once I ran away
I love you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I could take
I love you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, part, part)

Now everything is coming undone
Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart

I made a bad mistake
Used to pray for sins
Drowning you one more time
Amend my wicked ways

Cause once I ran away
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart
It's more than I could take
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart
Now everything is coming undone (coming undone)
cause You were the chance I can't afford to waste
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart
The day we fell apart
