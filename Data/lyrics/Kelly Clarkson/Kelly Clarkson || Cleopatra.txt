[Intro]
Your probably Cleopatra 
Dancing just for your pleasure 
What ever you wish babe 
(a whisper is all it takes) 

Diamonds around my waist 
They shimmer as I shake 
Let me know what you like. 
Your secrets your desires 
My arms will keep you warm 
No one will ever cause you harm 
Ill be your shelter through the storm 

[Chorus:]
They wont get near you baby 
Protect and keep you steady 
Rock you when things get heavy 
Hold you forever ever 
They cant stop you my baby 
When things start getting crazy 
I catch your back, lean on me 
I wont break Never never 

A queen to share your dreams with 
No one will come between us 
Let them abound with envy 
They want what we got baby 
I turn the lights down low 
Give you a little show 
My kisses for you only 
Temptations for the lonely 
Your wish is my command 
I follow when they say they can 
Ill be the one you can depend on 

[Chorus]

With everything I have left 
I saved it all just for you 
It they try and defeat us 
Watch me do what I'm good at 

Protect and keep you steady 
Rock you when things get heavy 
Hold you forever, ever 
I'll be your Cleopatra 
When things start getting crazy 
I catch your back - lean on me 
I wont break -never, never 

[Repeat Chorus]
