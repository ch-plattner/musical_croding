
I wonder how I ever made it through a day
How did I settle for the world in shades of gray
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
And you don't know why
And I looked into your eyes
Where the road stretched out in front of me
And I realized

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really livin'
I never lived
Before your love

I wanted more than just an ordinary life
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how
I survived without your kiss
'Cuz you've given me a reason to exist

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really livin'
I never lived
Before your love

I never lived
Before your love

And I don't know why
Why the sun decides to shine
But you breathed your love into me just in time

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really living
I never lived

I never lived

BEFORE YOUR LOVE!
