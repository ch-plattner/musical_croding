
You don't know how You shine
I guess no one told You
So let me be the first to show how I love Your eyes when You smile
Can't resist You even when I try
One day You'll see one day You'll believe me

I don't know why they left
I will never understand foolish hearts careless hands
I'm not like the rest of them
I'll be here forever till our lives end
One day You'll see one day You'll believe me
One day You'll know one day I won't have to show You

All I know is that I've found I've been looking for
Help You once so now took a chance and ask for a little more
You don't know how You light up every room or how You shine
I guess no one ever told You so if You don't mind
One day You'll see one day You'll believe me
One day You'll know one day I won't have to show You
