
The door's unlocked
And you don't even have to knock
Or you can use the fireplace
I'll be waiting either way

You come and go
And no one is supposed to know
But ever since you caught my stare
You know I know that you are real

Well Santa I've been thinking
And I'm just needing one thing
You to bring me
Something shiny

Like a diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany's
Or a big ruby
You know red has always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve
4 carats please

Oh oh
Oh

It's getting late
I know you have your rounds to make
But I've been waiting up for you
And now the clock has just struck 2

I'm looking out my windows
Looking for a red nose
My heart's sinking
Don't forget me

Or my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany's
Or a big ruby
You know red has always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve
4 carats please

Oh oh
Oh oh

Mm, something sparkly
Yellow canaries
Oh yea yea
Mm, I'm waiting patiently
Santa don't forget me
Don't forget me!

Or my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany's
Or a big ruby
You know red has always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve
4 carats please

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
