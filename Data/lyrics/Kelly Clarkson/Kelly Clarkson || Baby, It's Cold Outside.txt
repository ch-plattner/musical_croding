I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're cold as ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor - Listin to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Oh, maybe just one drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby,it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the use in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - Baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been - Baby, it's cold outside
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a half a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home - Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there
It's really been grand - I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Just think about my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Baby it's cold outside
