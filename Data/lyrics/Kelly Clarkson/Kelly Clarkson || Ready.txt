
Frozen
Forgetful again
The part where I lose my head
The scene where I'm supposed to speak but instead
I sit and listen again
I'm stuck with these cards, I guess
Leaping from this cliff in my thoughts
I fly like stones in my heart
Drowning in doubt, for what reason?
I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can't escape

[Chorus:]
I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now
Come get me

Fearless
With cape in hand
Conquer what I need to mend
Little girls get so broken
But I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can't seem to escape

[Chorus]

Through with golden roads and perfect love
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun
How I burn, how I burn
I was so patient waitin' for my turn
I fly like stones
As I break every bone
Come get me

[Chorus x2]
