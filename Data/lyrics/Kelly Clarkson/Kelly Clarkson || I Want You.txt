
Hot temper with the shortest fuse
You're such a mess with an attitude
You're workin' hard but you're payin' more
You never talk 'cause you don't have to
You gotta job but you hate the man
Who takes it all like 'Uncle Sam'
I want you
I want you

Outta gas so you walk for miles
To pick me up in your warn out shoes
You never settle, never take too much
You count on me just like I count on you
Kiss me, like when I first saw you
You figured out I couldn't be without you
You
I want you [3x]

No one else will do (I want)
No one makes me smile (I want)
No one gets me how (I want)
No one else is you

I want you [4x]

You're so hot tempered
With the shortest fuse
You're such a mess
And with an attitude
You
I want you [3x]

No one else will do (I want)
No one makes me smile (I want)
No one gets me how (I want)
No one else is you

I want you [5x]

You and me walkin' together
Screwing up for worse or for better
You
I want you
