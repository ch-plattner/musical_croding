I know I break your heart
With everything I'm not
Don't ever give up on me
Remember that we're strong
And even as we fall
Don't ever give up on me

These tears I'm holdin back
Could turn my whole face black
And I don't know if you'd love me 
If you saw me like that 
Would you?

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

My heart would turn to run
But even when I'm gone
Don't ever give up on me
I'm tryin deep within
If you could hold my hand
Don't ever give up on me

This war I'm fightin havoc
It turns me inside out and 
I don't know if you'd love me 
If you saw me right now
Would you?

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

How do you?
How do you?
Still believe in me
Even when 
Even when
All my colors bleed
Holdin out 
Holdin out
Will you love the rest of me

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me
