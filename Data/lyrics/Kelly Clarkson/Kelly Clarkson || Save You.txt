I can tell
I can tell how much you hate this
And deep down inside
You know it's killin' me
I can call
Wish you well
And try to change this
But nothing I can say
Would change anything
Where were my senses
I left them all behind
Why did I turn away
Away

[Chorus]
I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Didn't mean
Didn't mean to leave you stranded
Went away 'cause I didn't want to face the truth
Reachin' out
Reach for me empty handed
You don't know if I care you're trying to find the proof
There were times I'd wonder
Could I have eased your pain
Why did I turn away
Away

[Chorus]

It's gonna be alright
Save you
I wish I could save you

[Bridge]
We can pretend nothing's changed
Pretend it's all the same
And there will be no pain tonight

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Save you
I wish I could save you
I'm not going no where
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Save you
I wish I could save you

It's gonna be alright
