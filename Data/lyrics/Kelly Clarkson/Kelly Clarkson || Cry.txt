
If anyone asks
I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

[Chorus]
Is it over yet
Can I open my eyes
Is this as hard as it gets
Is this what it feels like to really cry
Cry

If anyone asks
I'll tell them we just grew apart
What do I care if they believe me or not
Whenever I feel your memory is breaking my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

[Chorus]

I'm talking in circles
I'm lying, they know it
Why won't this just all go away

[Chorus]
