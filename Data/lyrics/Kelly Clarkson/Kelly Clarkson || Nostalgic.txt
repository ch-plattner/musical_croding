
Don't be sad that it's over
Just be happy that it happened to us
Don't look back and remember
Drunken tears, oh
Remember the love

In my head I see you laughing from the words I said
Felt like a new beginning
In my head I see you standing there
The words you said, felt like a story ending

We will never ever be the same
The picture changes but not the frame
When I'm sleeping I still kiss your face
I can't have it when I'm awake

Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted it you can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic, nostalgic

I wonder if you're wearing that gold chain with a promise from me
Honestly felt so real then, even now it's not hard to believe

In my head I see you laughing from the words I said
Felt like a new beginning
In my head I see you standing there
The words you said felt like a story ending

We will never ever be the same
The picture changes but not the frame
When I'm sleeping I still kiss your face
I can't have it when I'm awake

Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted it you can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic, nostalgic

We will never ever be the same
We will never ever be the same
We will never ever be the same
Never be the same

Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted it you can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted it you can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it I still get nostalgic, nostalgic
