
It doesn't matter where we go
Silver, blue, white, away or home
It doesn't matter who you are
You know we're coming when you see the star

We're laying down tracks you're never gonna walk in,
Ahead of our time while you were busy watching.
Everybody wants to be a lonestar, a hero,
But only Texas has it all.

So get up on your feet (get up, get up)
Now if you wanna scream (get up, get up)
We're turning up the heat (get up, get up)
Now let me hear you sing (get up, get up)
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be,
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be.

(Get up, get up
Get up, get up)

It doesn't matter what you say,
We're growing stronger each and every day.
It doesn't matter how we do it,
We came, we saw, we conquered what you couldn't.

We're laying down tracks you're never gonna walk in,
Ahead of our time while you were busy watching.
Everybody wants to be a lonestar, a hero,
But only Texas has it all.

So get up on your feet (get up, get up)
Now if you wanna scream (get up, get up)
We're turning up the heat (get up, get up)
Now let me hear you sing (get up, get up)
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be,
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be.

I want you on your feet,
So if you want it, scream.

So get up on your feet (get up, get up)
Now if you wanna scream (get up, get up)
We're turning up the heat (get up, get up)
Now let me hear you sing (get up, get up)
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be,
I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
I wanna be, I wanna be.

So get up on your feet, yeah,
Now if you wanna scream,
Oh, we're turning up the heat,
Now let me hear you sing.
So get up on your feet (get up, get up)
Now if you wanna scream (get up, get up)
We're turning up the heat (get up, get up)
Now let me hear you sing (get up, get up).
