
Your feelin brave
He just glanced your way
You shouldn't stay
But its really not that late
So you say
As you flip your hair and bat your eyes
His way
Honey your mistaken cuz

He's my baby 
Maybe you might catch his eye
But I aint worried
Cuz girl he comes home to me at night
Your not the first and probably not the last
Whos gunna try
But you'll find that your all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right

I dont blame you
He's really something else
I'd want him too
Oh wait he's mine already
How rude of me to rub it in
But girl I'm through
Watching
And I'm warning you cuz

He's my baby 
And maybe you might catch his eye
But I aint worried
Cuz girl he comes home to me at night
Your not the first and probably not the last
Thats gunna try
But you'll find that your all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right

Just when the coast is clear
You move near
Inching closer
Closer to him and with that
Angel smile
You suddenly see my
One little problem
Im not the sheriff kind

Cuz he's my baby 
And maybe you might catch his eye
But I aint worried
Cuz girl he comes home to me at night
Your not the first and probably not the last
Thats gunna try
But you'll find that your all wrong
I know that your all wrong
You know that your all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right
