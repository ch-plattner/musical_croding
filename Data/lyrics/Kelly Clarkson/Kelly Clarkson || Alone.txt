
When we're driving in your car
It's like I'm on my own, yeah
I can't ask you how you are
You're always on the phone, yeah
And when we kiss I feel so empty
I really wish you knew what's been on my mind
You're gonna miss me, so get ready
I'm about to tell you why

'Cause when I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

When you look me in the eye
It's like you're far away, yeah
Some pretty legs go walking by
Your gaze is wandering, yeah
It's such a shame that you don't notice
The way that everybody's looking at me
Get off the train
This love is hopeless
Feeling like I'm gonna sink

'Cause when I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

But here's something you don't know about me
When you pushed me out
I found something better, you'll see
While you were paying no attention to me
I found somebody who can treat me right

When I'm with him I'm not alone
Gets better everyday
I hope you know, oh
I'm not alone
And it's never gonna change
I hope you know
When I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone)
I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone)
