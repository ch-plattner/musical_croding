[Verse 1] 
Ma the way you huggin on me is a problem what the fuck you tryin' to end up in the gossip column 
I know I got jewels like im the pharroah of the ghetto 
but we are in the bright ass shiny carrara 
stickin your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos 
costs a thousand dollahs same as your house n holla 
not to mention your wrists and the thirty thousand collah 
pussy must be good he's victim to your power....shit 
nigga like me I would never avower 
spit that shit to me i'd ask you haveyou showered 
you wanna get up in my boat and ride 
take pictues of with the kid up in ocean drive 
go to casatua and sip on calluas at the bar talking to other women about the best jewelers 
you would like that huh... 
smile and still call your girlfriend (why) 
who fell asleep at the wheel

[Verse 2] 
(hey yo) I walk in brashest

and every night we toast like its victory get with me 
and i aint change sense my early intel 
ive been snackin on shrimp and sippin on shirrley temples 
no drug to drinkin what you want 
no seriously what you thinkin sense the yukon 
never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
with a house full of dames like it was moulon 
i would ask there name but they would only do shaun 
and i aint sayin they regret it but fuck would they do but if they could reverse time what the fuck would they do

[Verse 3]

she admire how a champion lives how i sign slim slug with a ramp in my crib 
im a champion i do as a champion did except i improve with the new and the rest get rid 
but some ya'll dont like that it seems you tryin to bite back instead of sayin hi gettin fly but ill be right back

shoot the wings of your egoand watch you sky dive
