It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried
Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin'
Just close my eyes, and I stand there
And I smile
Smile
I smile, for you

Never give up on the things that, that can make you smile
Even if it means you gotta crawl for a thousand miles
Don't you worry, about how far to go
Enjoy the journey, and you know who you know you know

(Cheers, cheers) Cause the moment they underestimate me, I win
(Cheers, cheers) To you, good life's success, good sex, and kids
(Cheers, cheers) What I got for you, they can't contain with lids
(Cheers, cheers) When I look into your eyes and see our kids

I wish I could tell you how I feel
It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried
Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin'
Just close my eyes, and I stand there
And I smile
Smile
I smile, for you

Your known life is full of pressure, but don't you break
Just know a smile is a curve that sets everything straight
So don't you hurry, take your time, I have no fear
Cause fear stands for, false evidence of appearin' real

(Cheers, cheers) Cause the moment they underestimate me, I win
(Cheers, cheers) To you, good life's success, good sex, and kids
(Cheers, cheers) What I got for you, they can't contain with lids
(Cheers, cheers) When I look into your eyes and see our kids

I smile
I smile
I smile
I smile

I wish I could tell you how I feel
It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried
Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin'
Just close my eyes, and I stand there
And I smile
Smile
I smile, for you
