Woah Woah Woah 
Woah Woah Woah 

Break It Down, Break It Down, Break It Down 
Woah Woah Woah 
She Want Some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton 
Woah Woah Woah Woah 

Mamacita, Oh My God I Think Your On Fire 
Do You Want Me To Get You Water 
You Make Me Want To Be Your Baby Father 
Cause The Dance You Do Is Getting Hotter 
I Better Cuff You Before The Boys Follow 
Whatchu Think... 
I Think You Wanna...  I Think You Wanna... 

She Wanna Break It Down, Break It Down, Break It Down, Break It Down 
Woah Woah Woah 
She Want Some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton 
Woah Woah Woah Woah 

I Been Long Overdue 
For Something Overdone 
You Been On The Touch, Well I Can Make You Overcome 
I Know He Telling You What He Can Make You And 
I Know He Telling You Where He Can Take You 
By The Way Ma, Hey Is That Your Hair 
If It Aint It Took Two Days In The Hairshop Chair 
Im Just Jokin'... 
I Make Ya Smile Right... 

Come Here, I Mean Excuse Me Baby 
You Dancin Fastin Ma This Aint Meringe 
But Your Butt In Search Of Your Volentes 
It's Plump Im Bein Honest, Cause Its Just Nice 
You Lookin Different Sayin To Yourself 
This No Right, Sure You Cute 
But You Know Your Almost Missed This Flight 
When My Chain Keep Linkin' Like Christmas Lights 
Get It Right...

Mamacita, Oh My God I Think Your On Fire 
Do You Want Me To Get You Water 
You Make Me Want To Be Your Baby Father Wooah 
Cause The Dance You Do Is Getting Hotter Woooah 
I Better Cuff You Before The Boys Follow Wooah 
Whatchu Think... 
I Think You Wanna...  I Think You Wanna... 

She Wanna Break It Down, Break It Down, Break It Down, Break It Down 
Woah Woah Woah 
She Want Some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton 
Woah Woah Woah Woah... 

Yo Watsup Ma
