[Intro: Pharrell]
You miss me?
I miss all of y'all
Why y'all girls standin' together like that, I can't take it

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Women, I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read

[Refrain: Pharrell]
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

[Chorus: Both]
Come get it bae
Come get it bae
Come get it bae
Come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I can see it the way you like
I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on T.V

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Both]
There comes a time (comes a time), the craving will grab your wrist
You'll need a sugar fix, baby
There comes a time (comes a time), and you won't believe what you'll do
When that sugar's callin' you
Girl, there will come a time (sugar, sugar), this is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E, (sugar, sugar) satisfaction guaranteed
And there will come a time, this is where you wanna be
Cause it's everything you need, you will only find in me

Come get it bae [x4]

[Chorus]
