I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rollin' whatever I see,
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

Why ask why? Better yet "Why not?"
Why are you marking x on that spot?
Why use a blow torch isn’t that hot?
Why use a chainsaw? Is that all you got?
Why do you like seeing people in shock?
But my question to you is "Why not?"
Why go to the baker, stand in line
Just use a freeze gun it saves me time.

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rollin' whatever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

Why ask why when this is art?
Why parallel when I could just park?
Why does vector think that he’s smart?
And does his dad know I know his part?
Why did I have to live with my mom?
Why do you think that I should be calm?
Why want the moon, the World's in my palm?
Is it crazy you think I’ve gone?

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rollin' whatever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

Excuse me if you will
You look like you have time to kill
Huh, can you chill?
'Cause Gru's got the speakers in the trunk
To make you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
To make you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rollin' whatever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

Despicable me [repeated]

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rollin' whatever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me
