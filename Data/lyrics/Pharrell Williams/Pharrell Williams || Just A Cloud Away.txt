The contrast is why we got 'em
Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

So What you blown a fuse (you blown a fuse)
Well that happens to us all (that happens to us all)

When I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (change) change (change) change (change) change (change)

We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin, the dark
let good energy be your strong
Wont get away way way way

This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

Well today the rock star (today the rock star)
Feels like singing the blues
(Feels like singing the blues)
Don't abandon that song
(Don't abandon that song)
'Cause the view could change (change) change (change) change (change) change

We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin, the dark
gravity doesn't need the earth
Snow-balling change (change) change (change) change (change) change (change)

This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
Cause sun shining through is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

Everything is simply told
What goes around us come back around baby
Everything boomerangs
What goes
Up must come down
Love is warm, winter's cold
Humility will keep your feet on the ground
So do your thing through the rain
If you understand, wont you sing with me now?
