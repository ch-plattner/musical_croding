[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes cause you love me
(I'm sorry but.. so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)
So then we tried - singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear your ass up (tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just fronting (you know I want your babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want your (you should stop fronting babe)

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a show
Tell her you gonna call her ass how it was
And she's gonna love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)
So then we tried - singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear your ass up (tear your ass up)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[J:] We got another one Pha-real [Pharrell]
[P:] Dance, oh oh
[J:] I call you Pha-real cause you're the truth, ha ha, Young!
[P:] Whoa-oh, oh oh
[J:] Uh, yeah
[P:] Dance, oh oh
[J:] Yeah, lemme talk to em
[P:] Whoa-oh, oh oh
[J:] I'm a keep it real

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Everytime your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be fronting when I'm feeling Denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing but you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl but you are (I was just fronting)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Dance, oh oh
Whoa-oh, oh oh
Dance, oh oh
Whoa-oh, oh oh
