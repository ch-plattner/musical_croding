My dear it seems we're here again
So much for effort
Isn't it clear we're here again
Our thing right where we left it
A delusion is a flight, first class to nowhere
While a dream is a blueprint, a plane to go there
To go there

And I, I promise on all existence
If it breathes then it is our witness
We have unfinished business
You and I
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges
With zero regret for limits
And distance, you and I

My dear it seems we're here again
Was there a glitch in my method
Isn't it clear we're here again
Let's get new GPSes
So next time you see this place remember we were alone
We'll bring our children from home
That's right, ohh yeah, I'm gonna go there

And I, I promise on all existence
If it breathes then it is our witness
We have unfinished business
You and I
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges
With zero regret for limits
And distance, you and I

Well, anyone think they can can do it better
Well c'mon, c'mon
But back to you
Hold on girl we can make it
Stack whatever on top I can take it

It seems we're here again
This is the right trajection

And I, I promise on all existence
If it breathes then it is our witness
We have unfinished business
You and I
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges
With zero regret for limits
And distance, you and I
