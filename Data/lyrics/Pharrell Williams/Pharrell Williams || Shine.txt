[Gwen Stefani:]
One thing about me I'll be there for the team
I'll do anything to protect my big boys' dreams
And if the earth just finds me wandering 'round
You know my soul will rise up and keep on shining

Imagine you're a bear
You know we're inside
You disappear into thin air
I saw they put up the missing sign
(Reason?) they go through
That only shows you how much they really care
How I wish I was that bear
So I could feel the same inside
Just shine

Shine. Shine...

So we're in a strange new land
In Paddington station
But you end up in good hands
In the fancy British nation
You were the chosen
You're not imposing
The Browns want you there
Don't you want to be that bear
With the red hat he wears that makes him shine

One thing about me I'll be there for the team
I'll do anything to protect my people's dreams
And if the earth just finds me wandering 'round
You know my soul will rise up and keep on shining

[Pharrell Williams:]
([Gwen:] Shine!)
When you were trying to get home
([Gwen:] Shine!)
When you don't want to be alone
([Gwen:] Shine!)
Look at yourself in the mirror
That's your way home
([Gwen:] Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine!)

([Gwen:] Shine!)
When you were trying to get home
([Gwen:] Shine!)
And all your friends at home
([Gwen:] Shine!)
Look at yourself in the mirror
That's your way home
Now go!

Everybody is the same inside
But you don't wanna go home
Just like a little bear was alone
Hey if he were right it ain't known

You just want to shine
You just want to shine
You just want to shine
You just want to shine
