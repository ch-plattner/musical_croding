
Yeah, ye...spit my gum out right now...haha
What up world? Got my inspiration in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey

[Verse 1]
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness...
[cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
Cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
Cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer

[Chorus]
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).
See, you wont even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out

[Verse 2]
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis appartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped cause I chased, what made me passion that
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus wont change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sanskrit,
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless
Can't be mad at the world cause you and your girl ain't famous
Cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless
Now you brainless, dangerous, cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop
Nigga rewind and reverse slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scrunching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

[Chorus]

Star Track, is who we are [x4]
