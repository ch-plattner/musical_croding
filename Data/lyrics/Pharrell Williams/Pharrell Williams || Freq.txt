[Chorus x4]
You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward

[Bridge]
Just picture the love
It's pickin' you up
Your temple should buzz
From the vibration of love

[Verse]
You see I'd rather be a freq than not bein' me
Individuality makes life better
See I'd rather be a freq than not bein' me
The individuality makes life better

[Chorus x4]

[Bridge]
