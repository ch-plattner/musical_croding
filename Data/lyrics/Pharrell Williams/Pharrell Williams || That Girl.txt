[Pharrell:]
we do this in our sleep niggaz 
Yessir 

[Snoop:]
U eva been in love b4? 
Let me holla at u mann 
U know it's hard for a playa to admit that sumtimes 
But I'm a spit that sumtimes 
U know wat I'm sayin' 
Ay p, give it to em one time, nephew 

[Pharrell nd Charlie:]
There's sumthin bout this girl 
From around my way 
Ever try to hold back ur feelings, 
But it just wouldn't stay? 
But when I finally found the words to say 
I wanted to run away 
Simply run away 

[Pharrell:]
U can try to run and hide 
It wont make a difference 
U can lie to urself 
Of the reason 
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
That ur in love with the girl 

Yessir, that's her 
But it wasn't like that back wen I met her 
The lavish life from all the do? spun 
Before the RR had the hitchhike thumb 
Her friends didn't like niggaz like us but i 
Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed 
Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up 
But there's more to it 
I remember once 
Sayin' let's shit on the peons 
Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion 
Make em say 'wat we on??
U say no like u was doin it for eons 
Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
Wen it rains it pours 
I laughs to myself wen I change the score 
U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more 
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
I guess he played games 
There's only diamond dice here 
Not tryin ta justify 
But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky 
U in trouble ma 
And u should pray about speed 
But if this bout u 
Wat that say about me?

[Snoop:]
See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks 
And I does wat I does 
Yea I might say 'cuz? 
It's really weird cuz a nigga got love 
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood (what??) 
She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug 
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was 
I'm hollin lil mama like wat 
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back 
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser 
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza 
Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza 
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!? 
It's been a lil min since I seen her 
Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena
