
Ladies and gentlemen,
Yes sir,
Let's do it!
Yes sir,

Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming,
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit pop your bottles toast to screen cheers!
Get you 2-step 'cause it's the record of the year
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,
Officially announcing that this is warfare
'cause back in the day my clouds was grey
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse that cut the NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,
But now,

My business' so clear out the window of the leer
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear,
Listen clearly now,
Hello, can you hear me now?

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop your purse, and grab your hips,
And act like you're tryin' to get this money right quick,
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and this beat is zoning,
I control the mind straight over the phone,
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,
They never get addicted unless...
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,
She knows the time she sees the Richard Mille,
Flat double skeletal tourbillon
It's just like her body move it turns her on,
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See I can do it this away I can do it that away
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool like new edition that she hollas your scent,
I'll get it OK, let it boil away,
But please run along, 'cause lady is feeling wrong,
And I got some right for 'em right after this song
'cause my name is Skate-Board-P

Ladies and gentlemen,

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop your purse, and grab your hips,
And act like you're tryin' to get this money right quick,
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and the temperatures warming
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nautious,
Bright as a bitch
So analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit
Should I mention the fact the transition is the track
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at
No skateboy P too grown
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone
It's so cold you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh!)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh!)
I don't smoke but I bet the... love it!
Totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it

You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,
But all these little niggas got something in reach
So... you want me, these niggers did funny
While on my boat party trying to sun seek,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop your purse, and grab your hips,
And act like you're tryin' to get this money right quick,
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

(huh, huh, huh, huh)
