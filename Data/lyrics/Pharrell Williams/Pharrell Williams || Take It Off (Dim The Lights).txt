We've just been laughin'
Chattin' but nothing's happened
Cause I promise I'll be gentle
I know your mind is travelin'
I can tell you want some
I know you wanna come in my arms (my arms)

(you want some)

Take it off now girl, take it off
(I'm a master, baby with you bra)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(I can help you slide those panties off)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(Damn, that bootie's so soft)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(It feels so good in my palms)
Dim the lights down baby, dim the lights
We gon' double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
(...I'm a beat the pussy like you never ever felt before)
Dim the lights down baby, just dim the lights
We gon' double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
(...I'm a beat the pussy like you never ever felt before)

You breathe while your laughing
Smiling at what just happened
I try to keep it simple
Cause I know that you're old fashion
You wanna be wild (wanna be wild)
You don't wanna be tamed (don't wanna be tamed)
Even though you're just arrived (just arrived)
You wanna come again (you wanna come again)

Take it off now girl, take it off
(I'm a master, baby with you bra)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(I can help you slide those panties off)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(Damn, that bootie's so soft)
Take it off now girl, take it off
(It feels so good in my palms)
Dim the lights down baby, dim the lights
We gon' double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
(...I'm a beat the pussy like you never ever felt before)
Dim the lights down baby, just dim the lights
We gon' double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
(...I'm a beat the pussy like you never ever felt before)

Take it off now girl, take it off
(I'm a master, baby with you bra)
Take it off now girl, take it off

Take it off now girl, take it off

Take it off now girl, take it off
