Turn The Bass Down Some More...

Here We Go

I Just Got Your Text Message,
That You Want Me To Join You, Oh,(Yeah)
My Reluctance Would Be Less Threatning,
If You Told Me What You Had On

See This Is What Happens Soon As I Get Home
Damn Girl It Feels Good Being Right Here
You Can Tell I'm Serious By My Tone
I Can't See Your Eyes Move Your Hair
Is It Possible For You To Still Moan
This Is Changing My Life Do You Care
Can You Believe That My Mind's Been Blown
Or Should I Swear... That

I'm Your Guy
I'm Your Man To Be
I Can Make Anything Happen All Of A Sudden...
But 
You're My Girl,
You're My Fantasy...
And When You Kiss Me There It Pushes Love's Button...

[Chorus:]
(Ohh, Oh)(Cream)
It Seems You Licked My Creamsickle Down
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream)
But I Couldn't Get No Better No More
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream)
I Jump On When You Make That Sound
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream) 
In Two Minutes I'll Get You One More

You're So Perfect Girl (So Perfect Girl)
Your Pink Cookies On Top Of Those Ice Cream Scoops (Yeah)
I Want You Nekkid Gurl (Nekkid)
You're So Nekkid Sweet (Sweet)
By Now Your Peach Should Be Dripping Of This Juice

[Chorus:]
(Ohh, Oh)(Cream)
It Seems You Licked My Creamsickle Down
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream)
But I Couldn't Get No Better No More
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream)
I Jump On When You Make That Sound
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream) 
In Two Minutes I'll Get You One More

You'll/I Never Get Addicted Less Tha Headywop Is Surrious [x4]

Don't Be Lookin At The Speaker...
You Kno Thass Not The Way I Treat Ya...
Never Mind The Song, You're My Girl...
(You're My Girl, Yeah)
If You Want Me To, You Kno I'll Freak Ya...

It Seems You Licked My Creamsickle Down

I Jump On When You Make That Sound
(Ohh, Oh) (Cream) 
In Two Minutes I'll Get You One More
