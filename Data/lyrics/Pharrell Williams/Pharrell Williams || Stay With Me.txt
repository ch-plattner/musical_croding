[Intro]

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
You're that girl
[Who] thinks the world
Is somethin beautiful
And that's all baby
But your lookin for a brawn
with shed upon the wrong star
Cause it don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain, why things are made the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
It's just the way it goes (But i know you can)

[Chorus]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
Hide yours
Feel the bate
Hear the choice
Hear the choice
Hear the choice (Hey!)

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual (ooh baby)
But your priorities are disheveled
But your emotions and your health just don't go
Your body says no, So-
I can't conceive
That leaves will grow on trees in loweth degrees
and comeback next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that bore new skies
So whose to know, possible (that you could)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
Up, up and away
I be the wind that blows yourself
The pixie dust of tinkerbell
Up, up and away
I be the wind beneath your wings
Living color comes with you

[Pusha T Verse]
Baby let's it pour it up
Let them galardo doors up
Pat eve for them Louis as soon as the tours up
The million dollar frame is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when i heard about the lame
I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Naw)
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love you take the Good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch i ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it I want perfect
That was half the reason i bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface,
she ain't have to rehearse ,My baby's real (Yep)
That's why i put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet

[Chorus]
