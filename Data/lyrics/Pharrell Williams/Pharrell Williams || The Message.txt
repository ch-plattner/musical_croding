S-Choir and GQ
Don't kid yourself trying to save me too
Rigged yourself of thinking that me is you
You ain't me and nigga you can't be
I got the flow the regular so ahead of ya
The virtue hurts you 30 thousand for the cellular
I got a million in the air
Secret service men you don't know that they there

Gangsta Grizzill!
I got a lifetime supply of ice creams!

I got the flow the regular so ahead of ya
The virtue hurts you 30 thousand for the cellular
I got a million in the air
Secret service men you don't know that they there
You can't assassinate when I'm in my flashy state
They smugglin the actors with the Accolate
She hungry she wanna know how soon
Chill ma we got Mr. Chilles in the room
Eat how you supposed ta, sleep how you supposed ta
Sit in the muthafucking back seat like you supposed ta
This for certain we totally urk em
Put down the window but leave up the curtain
Fuck with their minds and do the reversin
Open up the boat with your grill just smirkin
Gangsta grizzill bright light like a vigil
The watch full of water but I guess it's on chizzill
Don't get izzill cause if it get for real
The AK-47 assault rifle
Don't get up for more cause I'll hit you with rifle
Or hit you in the spine and leave that ass cripple
All of you is dizzil or cat tizzil
Bubble in the heat so they temperature sizzle
You niggas rizzil

Gangsta Grill!
