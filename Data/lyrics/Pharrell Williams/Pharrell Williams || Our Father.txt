
Ou Father, Which art in heaven 
Im so grateful 
Of all the beautiful things 
That you are allowing me to see 
Birds, Bees 
The ability to do what I do 
The opportunities 
I know you love me now 
And i think it's time 
And my duty, to tell the world (jesus is my daddy im tellin' you, oh) 

... don't let me fall 
You watch for who im friends with 
I got tattoos, you forgive me 
You know im so sensitve 
You know im chased by women 
You know mt mind is drivin' 
To you my heart is givin'...oowww 

[Chorus]
You're the greatest 
You're the greatest (wow wow) 
you're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy im telling you) 
Your're the greatest 
Don't let me fall 

They don't understand 
What you do for me (do foe me) 
And nothing by my actions 
They don't I believe (I believe) 
Not talking 'bout what I wear 
When i drivin' where i sleep 
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep 

[Chorus]

Thank you for my brothers 
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)
