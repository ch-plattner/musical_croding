
If you could envision
The meaning of a tragedy...oooh
You might be
Surprised to hear it's you and me

When it comes down to it
You never made the most of it...oooh
So I cried, cried, cried
And now I say goodbye

And I won't be made a fool of...
Don't call this love

When did you decide
That I didn't have enough to buy?
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
For the fire and the sleepless nights

And I won't be made a fool of...
Don't call this love

Don't call this love
La la la la la la love
La la la la la la love

Why did you feel the need to prove that everybody else was right?
No, I won't fight

Oh you're my tragedy... tragedy
Oh you're my tragedy,
Oh, this is ooh no no no

La la la la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la la la love
