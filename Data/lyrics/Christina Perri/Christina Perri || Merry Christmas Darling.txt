
Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas, darling
We're apart, that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you

Holidays are joyful, there's always
Something new but every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you, the lights on my tree

I wish you could see, I wish it every day
Logs on the fire, fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy new year, too, I've just one wish
On this Christmas Eve, I wish I were with you

Logs on the fire, fill me with desire
To see you and to say that I wish you
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year too

I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you, I wish I were with you
Merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, darling
