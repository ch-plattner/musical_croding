Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

And have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

And here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

And through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow

Until then, we'll just have to muddle through somehow

And here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Someday soon we will all be together
If the fates allow

Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
