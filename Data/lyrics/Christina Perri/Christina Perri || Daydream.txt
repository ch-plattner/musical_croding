Finally your time has come 
Now's my chance to turn and run 
Like I always do 

Build a story in my head 
It was love before we met 
Happy, with my idea with you 

Stay where you are 
Please don't break my heart 

Love you in my daydream 
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth 
Everything I'll ever need 
Spoil it now, spoil it now 
You stood up and I fell down 

Watching me, watching you 
I know what you wanna do 
But I'm afraid of my wish coming true 

So I paint a picture in my mind, that 
I go back to older times 
It's better than being with you 

Stay where you are 
Please don't break my heart 

Love you in my daydream 
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth 
Everything I'll ever need 
Spoil it now, spoil it now 
You stood up and I fell down 

I don't know how to come down 
I was lost and now I am found 
You stood up and I fell down 

Love you in my daydream 
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth 
Everything I'll ever need 
Spoil it now, spoil it now 

Love you in my daydream 
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth 
Everything I'll ever need 
Spoil it now, spoil it now 

Love you in my daydream
