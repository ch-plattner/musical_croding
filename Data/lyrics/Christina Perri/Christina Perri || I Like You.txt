
It's like a little piece of heaven
When you stay
You make me feel like it's all
Okay
And now I know that the sun
Will only shine
When the clouds go away
Cause thats how you make me feel
Thats how you make me feel today

And you're like a little piece of candy
On my tongue
You're so much 
Fun
And i flip like a butterfly
With one look in your eyes
Thats how you make me feel
Thats how you make me feel tonight

And I think I like you
And I think you like me too

Lets keep dreaming and wishing
This way
Growups don't take enough time 
To play
Love, and so, it matters at the end of the day
That's how you make me feel
Thank you for making me feel this way

And I think I like you
And I think you like me too
