I believe if I'd knew where I was going, I'd lose my way
I believe that the words that he told you are not your grave
I know that we are not the weight of all our memories
I believe in the things that I am afraid to say

Hold on, hold on

I believe in the lost possibilities you can see
And I believe that the darkness reminds us where light can be
I know that your heart is still beating, beating darling
I believe that you fell so you can land next to me

'Cause I have been where you are before
And I have felt the pain of losing who you are
And I have died so many times, but I am still alive

I believe that tomorrow is stronger than yesterday
And I believe that your head is the only thing in your way
I wish that you could see your scars turnin to beauty
I believe that today it's okay to be not okay

Hold on, hold on

'Cause I have been where you are before
And I have felt the pain of losing who you are
And I have died so many times, but I am still alive

This is not the end of me, this is the beginning [x4]
(Hold on)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
(Hold on (I am still alive)
This is not the end of me, this is the beginning
