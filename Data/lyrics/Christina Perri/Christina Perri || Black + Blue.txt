
And I've been meaning to say this to you.
My heart isn't black and blue anymore
And your words don't mean a thing
When they're sung in vain

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some

It's been raining here like it never should
And I can't help believe it's because you're coming
And if a child wants to run away and a child wants to hide
Don't come following her fantasies
'Cause you might be surprised she'll run right back inside

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't where I meant to lay down!
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And if you're asking if I'm over love!
You're a fool to believe
You're a fool to believe!
That you gave me some.
