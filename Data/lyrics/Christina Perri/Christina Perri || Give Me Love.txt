Give me love, like her
'Cause lately I've been wakin' up alone
Pain splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And then I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight, I'll call ya'
After my blood, turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya'

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around
All I want, is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my...

Give me love, like never before
'Cause lately I've been cravin' ya' more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

And then I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight, I'll call ya'
After my blood, turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya'

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,

My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love, lover,

My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my...
