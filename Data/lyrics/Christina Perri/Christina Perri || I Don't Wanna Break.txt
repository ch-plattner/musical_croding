Woke up such a bad dream
I stayed, you were leaving
With my heart, you were stealing
I don't care, I'd let you take it

Showed up, like a good girl
I fell for your fable
But I'm no Cinderella
I don't care, I'd let you take it

Put us back together
You said, it's forever
But I know you're pretending
I don't care, I'd let you take it
All again...

And I just wanna love you
Don't wanna lose me
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh
If it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your

I just wanna love you
Don't wanna lose me
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh
If it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
(Don't wanna break in your)

And if it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your arms

Sometimes, when I'm sleeping
I still, feel you breathing
You stole, all my good dreams
I don't care, I'd let you take it

Come on, listen closely
To the sound, that our love made
If you go, I would follow
I don't care, I'd let you take it,
All again... mmmm

I just wanna love you
Don't wanna lose me
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh
If it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your

I just wanna love you
Don't wanna lose me
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh
If it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh

And if it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your)
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your)
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh

I just wanna love you
Don't wanna lose me
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh
If it gets harder
Then I don't wanna break all alone
I wanna break in your arms
