
Can you find the time to let your lover love you?
He only wants to show you
The things he wants to learn too
The hardest parts you'll get through
And in the end you'll have your best friend

Love like this may come once
Baby it's fate
Like a soul mate, he's your penguin
Baby it's fate
Baby it's fate
Not luck

Can you find the time to let your lover hold you?
He needs somebody to hold to
His love is strong and so true
His arrow is aiming for you
And he's the one that you were born to love

Love like this may come once
Baby it's fate
Like a soul mate, he's your penguin
Baby it's fate
Baby it's fate
Not luck

Let go
Let go
Of time for you
And I
Let go
Let go
Of time for you
And I
Let go
Let go
Of time for you
And I

Love like this is all I want
Baby we're fate
Love like this may come once
Baby we're fate
Like a soul mate, you're my penguin
Baby we're fate
Baby it's fate
Not luck
