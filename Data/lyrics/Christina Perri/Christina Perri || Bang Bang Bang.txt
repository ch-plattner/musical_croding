All my life you know I haven't been very love strong
There's been so many fights that I fought and I never won
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrongs
And word on the street is that she did to you what you did to me.

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so...
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so sweet.

So unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you.
Bending and breaking the rules and we're making exceptions to.
But how does it feel to swim in your own tears?
You lied and you lied, and I died and I died, and now you know why.

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so...
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so sweet.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so...
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.
Bang! She shot you.
Karma tastes so...
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
You're going down to the ground.
