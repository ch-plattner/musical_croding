
High, we get so high
But we fall down
It's no surprise
It's here we go, fighting
There you go again

Light on your own
Let this love
Turn to stone
There we go, fighting
There you go again
Here we go again

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all, something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time

Don't call me home
You only give what you've stole
There I go, hurting
There I go again
Here we go again

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all, something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time

Only try to make you
Only try to make you mine
Only try to make you
Only try to make you mine

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all, something incredible
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
You shot me in the heart this time
Shot me in the heart this time
Shot me in the heart this time
