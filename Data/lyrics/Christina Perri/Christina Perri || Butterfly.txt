
You’re a pretty butterfly
You keep on passing by
You never land inside my hands
Your home is in the sky
And there’s a lesson waiting to be learned
The fire starters always get the burns
And the good guys never get the girl
And shooting stars cannot fix the world
And I’ve made the same mistakes
But I won’t this time
No I won’t this time

And you’re a pretty butterfly
And I believed all your lies
Blinded by your sideways smile
And the kindness in your eyes
But there’s a limit to your flight
I can offer you a better life
But you keep on flying from the light
And I’ve lost my faith in wrong and right
And I’ve made the same mistakes
But I won't this time
No I won’t this time

I know exactly what you do
I made damn sure I studied you
You won’t pick me
I am just a breeze underneath your wings
So I pray each night you'll change your mind
And maybe I am worth the fight
But I am wrong every time
You only know how to fly

You only know how to fly
You only know how to fly
