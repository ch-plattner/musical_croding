
When I thought that my whole world had ended
The colours have faded to gray
Just when I had given up on hoping
The feelings they rushed back again

There's a bright light in the sky tonight 
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore

All that matters now
Is where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
To find that all we are is all that matters
Is all that matters

Remember all you've forgotten
The joy in the simplest of things 
Refuse to take life for granted
But you choose to celebrate all that life brings

There's a bright light in the sky tonight 
Guiding us safely to shore 
Not afraid anymore

All that matters now 
Is where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
To find that all we are is all that matters

There's a bright light in the sky tonight 
Guiding us safely to shore 
Not afraid anymore

All that matters now 
Is where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
To find that all we are is all that matters
Is all that matters
There's an easier way if we live for today
To find that all we are is all that matters
