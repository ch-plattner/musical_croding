
Just as fast as you came
Just as fast the sun set
You pushed me away, you pushed me down
Down, down, down, where my dreams lay

And just as quick as you left
Just as quick as you left my heart undressed
And I fell down, down, down, down
You took my wish back to the well

And I remember all the words that you said
That love is just a spark that starts in your heart
And ends in your head

Darling calm down, calm down
You lose yourself in the clouds
Slow down, slow down
Your world’s spinning around
May your untamed heart stay restless running wild
'Cause you're only, just a lonely lonely child

Just as dark as the night
Just as dark as the night
When I lost my mind, I lost control
Down, down, down
You let me sell my love for my soul

And I remember all the words that you wrote
That love is just a sound that plays in your heart
And gets caught in your throat

Darling calm down, calm down
You lose yourself in the clouds
Slow down, slow down
Your world’s spinning around, spinning around
May your untamed heart stay restless running wild
'Cause you're only, just a lonely lonely child

And I remember all the words that you said
That love is just a spark that starts in your heart
And ends in your head

Darling calm down, calm down
You lose yourself in the clouds
Slow down, slow down
Your world’s spinning around
May your untamed heart stay restless running wild
'Cause you're only, just a lonely
Yes, you're only, just a lonely lonely child

Cha-cha-cha!
