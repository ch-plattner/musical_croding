
All of the lights land on you
The rest of the world fades from view
And all of the love I see
Please please say you feel it too
And all of the noise I hear inside
Restless and loud, unspoken and wild
And all that you need to say
To make it all go away
Is that you feel the same way too

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth

And all of the steps that led me to you
And all of the hell I had to walk through
But I wouldn’t trade a day for the chance to say
My love, I’m in love with you

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth

I know that we’re both afraid
We both made the same mistakes
An open heart is an open wound to you
And in the wind of a heavy choice
Love has a quiet voice
Still your mind, now I’m yours to choose

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Let my love be the light that guides you home

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth
