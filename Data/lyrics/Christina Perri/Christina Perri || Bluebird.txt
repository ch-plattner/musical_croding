Teach itself to start beating again? Ba, ba, ba, ba.

This little bluebird came looking for you
I said that I hadn’t seen you in quite some time
And this little bluebird, she came looking again
I said we weren’t even friends, she could have you

Don’t you think it was hard?
I didn’t even say that you died
But it wouldn’t have been such a lie, ‘cause then I started to cry

This little bluebird sure won't give it a rest
She swears that you may be better than all the rest
I said, “No, you’ve got it all wrong.
If he was something special, I wouldn’t have this song.”

Don’t you think it was hard?
I didn’t even say that you died
But it wouldn’t have been such a lie, ‘cause then I started to cry

How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it’s torn apart
And teach itself to start beating again? Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba.

What if when she comes over, I am in your arms, taking all I want from you again?
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba.
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba.

How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it’s torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again? Ba, ba, ba, ba.
How the hell does a broken heart get back together when it’s torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again? Ba, ba, ba, ba.
Beating again. Ba, ba, ba, ba.

This little bluebird don't come 'round here anymore
So I went looking for her and I found you
