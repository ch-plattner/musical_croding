
Like the wind is blowing
Change is fast and growing
I knew better than
I knew better than

Words that hurt the ones you're lovin’
Hatred for who you’re becomin’
I knew better than, yes
I knew better than

To trust myself
To trust someone else
To trust the lies that slip from my mouth
Trust the heart I’m so quick to sell

Yes, I knew better than
I knew better than to trust love again

Memories that won’t stop stinging
Promises I can’t believe in
I knew better than
I knew better than

To trust myself
To trust someone else
To trust the doubt in the back of my mind
Trust the trail of pain left behind

Yes, I knew better than
I knew better than to trust love again

And I’m so quick to lose what was never mine to keep
And I cannot stand on what’s broken under me
And I don’t know how to forgive myself for everything
But I must learn trust

Like the wind is blowing
Change is fast and growing
I knew better than
I knew better than
