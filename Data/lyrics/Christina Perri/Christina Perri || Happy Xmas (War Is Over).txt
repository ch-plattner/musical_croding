
So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year's over
And a new one's begun

So this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
Who waited so long

And so Happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year's over
And a new one's begun

So this is Christmas
I hope you've had fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over if you want it
War is over now
War is over if you want it
War is over now
War is over if you want it
War s over now
War is over if you want it
War is over now
