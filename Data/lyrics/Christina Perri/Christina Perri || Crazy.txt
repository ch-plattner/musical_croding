
Everyone thinks I'm crazy
for thinking that when you see me 
you're gonna love me

but I tell them it's easy
like loving is supposed to be

walk into the room love
I'll be waiting
miles and miles and miles oh my love
I've come to find
find you

Must request a dance or two 
until morning ruins
all my plans for you

strangely I don't give a damn 
about his circumstance
or hang-up for you

walk beside this lullaby love 
for dreams of you and I love
miles and miles and miles oh my love
I've come to find
find you

How 
many ways 
can I explain 
my love 
for you

without 
sounding like a little girl 
looking up to you

taught 
me everything
yes you taught

...taught me pain
and because of you I've changed

Everyone thinks I'm crazy
for thinking that when you see me 
you're gonna love me
