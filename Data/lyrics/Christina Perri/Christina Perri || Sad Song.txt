
Today I'm Gonna write a sad song,
I'm gonna make it really long
So that everyone can see,
That I'm very unhappy.

I wish I wasn't always wrong
I wish it wasn't always my fault
But the finger that you're pointing
Has knocked me on my knees
And all you need to know is

I'm so sorry it's not like me,
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow

I wonder what my mom and dad would say,
If I told them that I cry each day.
But it's hard enough to live so far away.

I wish I wasn't always cold
I wish I wasn't always alone
When the party is over,
How will I get home?
And all you need to know is

I'm so sorry it's not like me,
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow

If all the rules were made to bend
And you swore you were my friend
Now I have to start all over again

Cause no one's going to take your place
And I'm scared I'll never save
All the pieces of a love we made

And I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that I can slip and fall
And you won't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow

And I'm so sorry
It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.
