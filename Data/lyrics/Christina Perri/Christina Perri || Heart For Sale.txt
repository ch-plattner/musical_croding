I've got a heart for sale
It's a little worn, and torn, and pale
If it beats, then I'll make you a deal
I'll give it to you for free,
If you can love it, carefully,
And get, it away from me. 

[Chorus]
I know that I
Should keep it for a while
And learn what it 
May need to survive
But I can't, no I won't
Make it through
One more loveless bruise

I can't seem to get it right
But I try, and try, and try
In the end, I just lose all the fights
And crawl back home to hope my heart
Can make it through
Another night of the same, Old pain. 

[Chorus]
I know that I
Should keep it for a while,
And learn what it 
May need to survive
But I can't, No I won't
Make it through, One more loveless bruise

[Bridge]
I'll give you a try
If your not satisfied, 
Then send it back
And I'll mend the cracks
And I'll look for another buyer.

[Chorus]
I know that I
Should keep it for a while
And learn what it needs to survive
But I can't, No I won't
Make it through
One more loveless bruise

Tired of being used
You don't know, What I've been through.
