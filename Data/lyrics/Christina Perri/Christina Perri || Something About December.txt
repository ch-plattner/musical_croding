Lights around the tree 
Mama's whistling 
Takes me back again 
There's Something bout' December 

We're hanging mistletoe 
And hoping that it snows 
I close my eyes and then 
I can still remember 
How to get back, home 

Let all your memories 
Hold you close 
No matter where you are 
You're not alone 
Because the ones you love 
Are never far 
If Christmas is in your heart 

Who really needs a gift 
When love is meant to give 
I can still recall 
Carry with me always 
Every Christmas dream 
They live in you and me 

Let all your memories 
Hold you close 
No matter where you are 
You're not alone 
Because the ones you love 
Are never far 
If Christmas is in your heart 

Lights around the tree 
Mama's whistling 
Takes me back again 
There's Something bout' December 

Let all your memories 
Hold you close 
No matter where you are 
You're not alone 
Because the ones you love 
Are never far 
If Christmas is in your heart
