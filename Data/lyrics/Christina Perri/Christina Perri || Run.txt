And why do I breathe with what's beating in my chest
You think I'd learn better now cause you can't get any rest
Cause I keep trying to find happiness
In everybody else
And please move that finger that's been pointing to my mistakes
I want no part in the feelings your words make
So let go, let me love you today

And you're so damn difficult
You'd lose a heart in your hand
And I can't believe you made me work for it
No one understands
Why I don't run as fast as I can

And I can feel everything
I can feel your emptiness
And I don't believe there's a way out of this mess
Unless I can forgive all your sins that I won't learn
I'll never love again
Again

See right through my wounds
See I'm just like you
Watch me stumble, watch me choose
All your lies
All your lies
All your lies

You're so damn difficult
You'd lose a heart in your hand
And I can't believe you made me work for it
No one understands
Why I don't run as fast as I can
