
I Think I'm Done With The Sofa
I think i'm done with the hall
I think i'm done with the kitchen table, baby

Let's go outside (let's go outside)
In the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside
In the moonshine
Take me to the places that i love best

So my angel she says, don't you worry
'Bout the things they're saying, yeah
Got no friends in high places
And the game that you gave away
Wasn't worth playing

Let's go outside
In the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside
In the meantime
Take me to the places that i love best

And yes i've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see i think about it all the time
Twenty four seven

You say you want it, you got it
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more
There's nothing more

Back to nature, just human nature
Getting on back to -

I think i'm done with the sofa
I think i'm done with the hall
I think i'm done with the kitchen table, baby

Let's go outside
In the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside
In the moonshine
Take me to the places that i love best

And yes i've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see i think about it all the time
I'd service the community
(but i already have you see!)
I never really said it before

There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more
There's nothing more
Let's go outside
Dancing on the d-train baby

When the moon is high
And the grass is jumpin'
Come on, just keep on funkin'
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'
