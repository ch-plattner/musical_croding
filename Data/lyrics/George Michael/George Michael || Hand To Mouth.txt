
Jimmy Got Nothing Made Himself A Name
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day
A smite and a quote from a vigilante movie
Our boy jimmy just blew them all away
He said it made him crazy
Twenty five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker
It happens everyday
She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bare to see her living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of america
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
(no one told me)
That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands i pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me
(see me)

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
"like to help you buddy but i haven't got the time"
Somebody shouted save me
But everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady
On a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said "yes"
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little -
They say it's for the best
Somebody shouted
Maybe
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of america
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me
(someone told me)
That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands i pray
And i tell myself
One day
They just might see me
