
I'd Say Love Was A Magical Thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had i been there
Had i been there
I i would promise you a!! Of my life
Hut to lose you would cut like a knife
So i don't dare
No i don't dare

'Cause i've never come close
In all of these years
You are the on!y one to stop my rears
And i'm so scared
I'm so scared

Take me back in time
Maybe i can forget
Turn a different corner
And we never would have met
Would you care?

I don't understand it
For you it's a breeze
Little by little
You've brought me to my knees
Don't you care?

No i've never come close
In all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is
Is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If i could, i would, i swear.
