
Mama's gone and got herself a new man
It's a shame,
He's the same
Mama please please, stop pretending
This time, it won't end in tears
I find myself, with a new daddy
My mama needs love you see
Guess she don't wanna be lonely

And nobody's keeping score
I don't say hi to those guys no more
Said mama can't you feel me
Holding my breath as they knock, knock, knock on our door

You're just taking your ass to the top of that building
Throwing yourself under cars and trains
Taking the pill that you know will kill you
Under the wheels,
The same, the same....

Johnny's gone and got himself a new man
He gets laid, every day
Johnny please please, stop pretending
This time, may just end in tears
Take care of yourself
Because you won't find 'daddy'
When you're popping those pills
Oh Johnny, is the danger just part of the thrill?

And nobody's keeping score
Johnny those guys that you shake it for
I said "Johnny can't you hear them
Saying mama knows best as they knock, knock,
knock on your door"

You're just taking your ass to the top of that building
Throwing yourself under cars and trains
Taking the pill that you know will kill you
Under the wheels, the same, the same

Taking your ass to the top of that building
Throwing yourself under cars and trains
Taking the pill that you know will kill you
Under the wheels, wheels, wheels

Pretty girl, little girl, what were you thinking
Just 18 at the time
You were a mother and child, at the same time
You were a mother and child
So young and fucked up baby
Always higher than a child should see...
Forgive me

To the top of that building
Under cars and trains
Taking the pill that you know will kill you
Under the wheels, wheels, wheels

Mama don't you let him stay

From bastard to loser, hurt you, used you in every way,
Mama, don't you let him stay, please
Don't let him stay

I said Jesus, Mary, and the Saints above,
Won't you show him love?
