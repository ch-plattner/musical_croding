
I Remember You 
You're the one who made my dreams come true 
A few kisses ago 

I remember you 
You're the one who said i love you too 
Didn't you know 

I remember too 
A distant bell 
And stars that fell 
Like rain out of the blue 

When my life is through 
And the angels ask me to recall 
The thrill of them all 
Then i will tell them i remember you 

I remember you 
You're the one who made my dreams come true 
A few kisses ago 

I remember you 
You're the one who said i love you too 
Didn't you know 

I remember too 
A distant bell 
And stars that fell 
Like rain out of the blue 
I miss you darling 

When my life is through 
And the angels ask me to recall 
The thrill of them all 
Then i will tell them i remember you
