
Sometimes I Get The Feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were
Young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - i just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show.

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-
When i look and i find, i still love you.

You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn
Back the tide
Ain't that a shame? (ain't that a shame?)
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately i just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When i look and i find - no change

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-
When i look and i find, i still love you

I still love you
I love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
Still love you
