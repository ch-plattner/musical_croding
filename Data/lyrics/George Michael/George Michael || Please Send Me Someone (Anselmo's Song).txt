Some people said, if I could only care for you
Some people said, he will never love again
Some people said, you can see it in his eyes
He keeps it all inside and yet . . . .
Some people say, in time, we all teach ourselves to live this way

And for a thousand days, I was lost
I thought never to be found,
Underground
And don't you think I'm ready now?
So please send me someone to love . . .

Please send me someone, someone to love
As much as I loved you
(The way I loved you, darlin')
Please, please send me someone, someone to love
Please send me someone

Any time, any day, any time, any day now
Any time any day, any time, any day now
Please, please send me someone
Just to hold me now that you're gone

Some people say, "I hope you know I'm there for you"
Some of the people said - nothing,
And nothing was just fine
(You know how I get sometimes . . .)

And for a thousand days, I was lost
I said, "Heaven knows I'm ready to be found",
Underground
But I think I'm ready now
So please send me someone to love

Please send me someone, someone to love
As much as I loved you
Please, please send me someone, someone to love
Please send me someone
Please send me someone

Any time any day any time any day now
Any time any day any time any day now
Please, please send me someone

So say that you will, because the nights are long
Without our song to sing
Just search the clouds until . . . until
So say that you will
Show me right from wrong,
Without our song to sing
Just search the clouds until . . . until
And Darlin' darlin' though I can't replace you, there's a
space in my heart
A space that you left in my heart
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue

Oh send me someone like you

Darlin' darlin' no I can't replace you, there's a space in my heart
A space that you left in my heart
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue

Please send me someone to love
