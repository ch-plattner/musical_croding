
Spin the wheel

Five o'clock in the morning
You ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
Baby i just want you to know
I won't go through it again
Yes, those clouds are closing in

And i will not accept this as a part of my life
I will not live in fear
Of what may be
And the lessons i have learned...
I would rather be alone than watch you
Spinning that wheel for me

You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
One of these days
You're gonna bring some home to me

Six o'clock in the morning you ain't phoned
I can't help thinking that's strange
It seems that everybody take some home to me

Six o'clock in the morning you ain't phoned
I can't help thinking that's strange
It seems that everybody takes

Their chances

These days
Oh yeah, we're standing in the rain

And i will not accept this as a part of my life etc....

How can you love me
When you are playing with my life
You say give me time and i'll do better i swear
Give me time and i'll lead you back to despair

And i don't want to go back there
