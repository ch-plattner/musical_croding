A Desert Road From Vegas To Nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin' -
In a little cafe just around the bend

[Chorus:]
I am calling you
Can't you hear me? 
I am calling you.

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and i can't sleep
Bit we both know that a change is coming
Gome in closer, sweet release

[Chorus]

Desert road from vegas to nowhere
Dear friends
So dear friends your love has gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon
