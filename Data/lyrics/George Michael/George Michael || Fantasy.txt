One Day You Say You Love Me
The next you tell me you don't
One day you say you will
The next you tell me you won't
Hey little baby, there ain't much point in hanging around, yeah

One day you make me feel that your love is in my hands
One day you say you'll stay
The next you're changing your plans
Hey little baby, there ain't much point in hanging around, yeah

'Cos if you ain't got time for me
I'll rind another fantasy

It's kind of funny that you think
That i'm the boy to make you cry
I can make you happy if only for a while, little baby
Oh little baby, i can give you all the loving that your heart desires

'Cos if you ain't got time for me
I'll find another fantasy

I said it could be the price of love
Could be the price of hate
What am i guilty of?
Why do you make me wait so long?
I don't know your intentions
Look to the skies above
I'm in the hands of fate
Push 'til it gets to shove
I've got to know for heavens sake is this love, is this love or invention

'Cos baby can't you see
I'll find another fantasy

You hang around the people who you are sure make you cry
And i can make you happy if only for a while, little baby
Oh little baby, i can give you all the loving that your heart desires

If only for a while little baby
Oh little baby, i can give you all the loving that your heart desires

'Cos if you ain't got time for me
I'll find another fantasy

You take someone's heart and you kick it around
Keep on picking it up so you can watch it come down
I don't know what i'm supposed to do
Why i wait fur you to make up your mind
Could you please be so kind
When you know what to do
I'll be in the next room
But if you leave it too late i may be in the next state
