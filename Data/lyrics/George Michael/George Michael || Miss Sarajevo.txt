
Is There A Time For Keeping A Distance 
A time to turn your eyes away 
Is there a time for keeping your head down 
For getting on with your day 

Is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
A time for cutting hair 
Is there a time for high street shopping 
To find the right dress to wear 

Here she comes 
Heads turn around 
Here she comes 
To take her crown 

Is there a time to walk for cover 
A time for kiss and tell 
Is there a time for different colors 
Different names you find it hard to spell 

Is there a time for first communion 
A time for east 17 
Is there a time to turn the mecca 
Is there a time to be a beauty queen 

Here she comes 
Beauty plays the crown 
Here she comes 
Surreal in her crown 

[Pavarotti:]
Dici che il fiume 
Trova la via al mare 
E come il fiume 
Giungerai a me 
Oltre i confini 
E le terre assetate 
Dici che come fiume 
Come fiume 
L'amore giunger 
L'amore 
E non so pi pregare 
E nell'amore non so pi sperare 
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare 

[English translation:]

You say that the river 
Finds the way to the sea 
And as the river 
You'll come to me 
Beyond the borders 
And the thirsty lands 
You say that as river 
As river 
Love will come 
Love 
And i cannot pray anymore 
And i cannot hope in love anymore 
And i cannot wait for love anymore 

[Bono:]
Is there a time for tying ribbons 
A time for christmas trees 
Is there a time for laying tables 
When the night is set to freeze
