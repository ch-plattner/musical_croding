Can Anybody Find Me
Somebody to love?
Each morning i get up i die a little
Can't barely stand on my feet

Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing ro me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But i just can't get no relief, lord

Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me someone to love
I work hard everyday of my life
I work till i ache my bones

At the end i take home my
Hard earned pay ail of my own
I get down on my knees and i start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, lord

Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love
Everyday i try and i try
But everybody want to put me down

They say i go'in crazy
They say i got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody to believe

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, somebody
Somebody can anybody find me
Somebody to love

Got no feel, i got no rhythm
I just keep losing my bear
I'm ok, i'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat

I just got ta get out of this prison cell
One day i'm gonna be free, lord
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to tove

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

Somebody find me somebody
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love

Find me somebody to love!
Find me somebody to love!
Find me, find me, find me, find me.
