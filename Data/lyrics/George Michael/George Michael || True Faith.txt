I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense, a sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
But don't you know something's really got a hold on me
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys would talk to me
Now that we've grown up together
Can you believe?
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
Our valued destiny has come to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there's just no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear
(Something's got a hold on me)
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear

Oh and I know and I know I know it's just so bitter
And it's so wrong, it's so wrong
Oh I know and I know but I I I have a question
Big fuckin' question

I'm in motion, motion
I'm in motion, I have a question
And I'm in motion, motion
I have a question, motion
I have a question
