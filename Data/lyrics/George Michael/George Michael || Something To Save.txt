
If you've got something to say
Why don't you say it
If you've got something to give
Why don't you give it to me
Day after day i have to say it
We're moving further from heaven
And closer to the deep blue sea

'Cause i have no secrets from you
And i have nothing left to hide
And i'm open to all your questions
Why can't you reach inside
Like i have
Like i have for you

And all these games that you play
Don't tell me how a man should be
Some would say if you knew
You wouldn't be here with me
I love you
I still love you
But i guess it's time to let you be

'Cause i have no secrets from you
And i have nothing left to hide
And i'm so tired of all these questions
'Cause maybe you just changed your mind
Like i have
Like i have
Like i have
Like i have

When i was at your doorstep
You told me to look around
Said come in
You and your heart sit down
But you'd better watch your step
'Cause you're not far from the ground
And one fine day this all falls down
Like i have
Like i have

If you've got something to say
Why don't you say it
If you've got something to give
Why don't you give it to me
Day after day i have to say it
If we've got something to save
Why don't we save it
