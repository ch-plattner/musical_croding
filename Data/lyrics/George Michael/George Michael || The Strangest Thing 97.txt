
Take My Life
Time has been twisting the knife
I don't recognise
People i care for

Take my dreams
Childish and weak at the seams
Please don't analyse
Please just be there for me

The things that i know
Nobody told me
The seeds that are sown
They still control me
There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is i cannot get my eyes open

Take my hand
Lead me to some peaceful land
That i cannot find
Inside my head

Wake me with love
It's all i need
But in all this time
Still no one said...

If i had not asked
Would you have told me
If you call this love
Why don't you hold me

There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is i cannot get my eyes open

Give me something i can hold
Give me something to believe in
I am frightened for my soul, please, please
Make love to me, send love through me
Heal me with your crime
The only one who ever knew me,
We've wasted so much time
So much time
