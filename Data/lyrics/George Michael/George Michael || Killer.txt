
So You Want To Be Free
To live your  life the way you wanna be
Will you give if we cry
Will we  live or will we  die

Tainted hearts heal with time
Shoot bad love so we can
Stop the bleeding

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live?
Solitary sister, is there still a  part of you that
Wants to give?
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live?
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give?
If we try to live our lives
The way we wanna be     
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live?
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give?          
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live?
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give?

Racism in future kings, can only lead to no good
And besides, all our sons and daughters already
Know how that feels
