
Once I Had A Secret Love 
That lived within the heart of me 
All too soon my secret love 
Became impatient to be free 

So i told a friendly star 
The way that dreamers often do 
Just how wonderful you are 
And why i'm so in love with you 

Now i shout it from the highest hill 
I even told you the golden dafodill 
At least my heart's an open door 
And my secret love's no secret anymore 

Now i shout it from the highest hill 
I even told you the golden dafodill 
At least my heart's an open door 
And my secret love's no secret 
My secret love's no secret 
My secret love's no secret anymore
