
I'm back I'm back
Prouder than ever baby
Louder than ever maybe

One more pill just one more beer
One less star in the atmosphere for us
But maybe she just wanted to be free
Heartless pictures on TV
Change that channel that could have been me I said
Maybe she just wanted to be free

So I just kept breathing my friends
Waiting for the man to choose
Saying this ain't the day that it ends
'Cause there's no white light and I'm not through
I'm alive I'm alive...
And I've got so much more that I want to do with the music
Was it music that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed for me?
Guess either way, I thank you I'm alive

Hotel Motel makes it clear
One more voice we will never hear again
But maybe he just wanted to be free
And I don't know what the hell, what the Gods,
What the f*ck I'm saying half the time
But something divine, oh divine
Brought me back to you and I know it

So I just kept breathing my friends
Waiting for some God to choose
Saying this ain't the day that it ends
'Cause there's no white light and I'm not through
I'm alive I'm alive...
And I've got so much more that I want to do
Was it music? Was it science that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed for me?
Guess either way I thank you I'm alive

And tomorrow is mine, I said tomorrow is mine
Said I just got to keep on breathing
I said no, don't let go breathing breathing...
Got to keep on, got to keep on, got to keep on
I just got to keep on breathing
I'm alive I'm alive...
And I've got so much more that I want to give
Was it music? Was it science that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed and prayed for me
Well I thank you I'm alive yeah
