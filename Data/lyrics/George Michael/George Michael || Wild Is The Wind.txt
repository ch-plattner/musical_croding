Love Me, Love Me, Love Me, Love Me 
Say you do 
Let me fly away with you 
For my love is like the wind 
And wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 

Give me more than one caress 
Satisfy this hungriness 
Let the wind blow through your heart 
Oh wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 

You touch me 
I hear the sound of mandolins 
You kiss me 
With your kiss my life begins 
You're spring to me 
All things to me 
Don't you know 
You're life itself! 

Like the leaf 
Clings to the tree 
Oh my darling cling to me 
For we're like creatures of the wind 
And wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind 

You touch me 
I hear the sound of mandolins 
You kiss me 
With your kiss my life begins 
You're spring to me 
All things to me 
Don't you know 
You're life itself! 

Like the leaf 
Clings to the tree 
Oh my darling cling to me 
For we're like creatures of the wind 
And wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind 
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
