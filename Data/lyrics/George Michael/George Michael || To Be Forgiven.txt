
I'm going down
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of a memory
Maybe time will tell

Suddenly my life is like a river
Taking me places i don't want to go
But like all good men who swim too well
It takes all that i have just to cry for help
Then that voice in my head
Tells me no

I'm going down
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I look around for a fantasy
Maybe
Who can tell?

Let me live my life beside the river
Take me to places where a child can grow
And then
Maybe the boy inside will forsake me
Maybe
The child in me
Will just let me go

I'm going down
The cold, cold water is rushing in
I'm going down
And i would beg to be forgiven

If i knew my sin
