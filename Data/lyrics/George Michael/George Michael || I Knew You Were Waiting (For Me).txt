
Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over,
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment,
No, I don't (I know you don't) looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny (oh, boy)
I know this love we shared was meant to be

I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me
