
My daddy got here on the gravy train
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
They went walking and she took his name
Round here

There was dancing in the afternoons those days
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same

Frightened little girl, she makes a break
Into the arms of... something better
Round here

I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark
Waiting patiently to make my mark
Round here

And I remember my first day at school
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool
I remember it all, like yesterday

Don't you

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, "You can do better"
Round here

So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
I want to put my hands in this earth again
Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth

When all that I wanted, was to be someone.

Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls
Andy says it's time to show them all
Round here

Please sir, we two have other plans
Please sir you would not understand,
What's going on
Is magical, can't you see
That some of us do more than dream

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, "Keep on keeping, on and on...."
Around here

So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
I want to put my hands in this earth again
Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, ABC
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth

My birth,
In this town,
Yes I guess I got to be someone

To be somebody
In the Beautiful city

This place I call home
These streets of London
It's everything I know (everything and everybody)
On the streets of London
I want to thank you

My daddy got here on the gravy train.
