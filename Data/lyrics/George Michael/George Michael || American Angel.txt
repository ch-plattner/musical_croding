Bless the day you came into my life, I still remember
Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes
Bringing the light into my day
With that Texan smile

Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away

My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
And you stayed forever and more

(I don't think that I...)

Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December
All alone I watched the eagles fly
Even the light seemed to have changed
In the Californian sky

Through all of those battles then you came
Stepped out of the fading light
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again,
Because I'm here to save your life"

My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
But you stayed forever amore

And more, didn't you baby..

Because I don't think that I could love and lose again
I don't think I have the strength
I don't think I have the strength

I don't think that I...
