
When You're Awake 
The things you think 
Come from the dreams you dream 
Thought has wings, 
And lots of things 
Are seldom what they see 
Sometimes you think you've lived before 
All that you live today 
Things you do come back to you 
As though they knew the way 
Oh, the tricks your mind can play 

It seems we stood and talked like this before 
We looked at each other in the same way then 
But i can't remember where or when 
The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore 
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then 
But i can't remember where or when 
Some things that happen for the first time 
Seem to be happening again 
And so it seems that we have met before 
And laughed before 
And loved before 
But who knows where or when 

It seems we stood and talked like this before 
We looked at each other in the same way then 
But i can't remember where or when 
The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore 
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then 
But i can't remember where or when 
Some things that happen for the first time 
Seem to be happening again 
And so it seems that we have met before 
And laughed before 
And loved before 
But who knows where or when
