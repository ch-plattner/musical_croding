As Around The Sun The Earth Know She's Revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assured that
I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
Hut in passing will grow older everyday
Just as ail that's born is new
You know what i say is true
That i'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that 8천8천8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As today i know i'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past
But that i mustn't fear
I know deep in my mind
The love of me i've left behind
Cause i'll be loving you always.

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8천8천8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
For now i know deep in my mind
The love of me i've left behind
Cause i'll he loving you always.

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
