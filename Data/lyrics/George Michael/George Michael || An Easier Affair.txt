
Here comes one for the ladies
For the ones who love me
To think I thought, I could be
Some kind of family man

I told myself I was straight
But I shouldn't have worried
?Cos my Maker had a better plans for me

And I'm dancing with the freaks now
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun, in here
What you sow is what you reap now
I'll do my dance with everyone

I've been getting too much sun
Yes, I'm dancin' with the freaks now
We're havin', we're havin' too much fun for them, baby
Look who's talking guilty feet now

Well, let me tell you people, it's an easier affair
Not living my life with other people on my mind
No, got nothing to hide from anyone

Yes, I'm walking on new air just living my life
Better believe, I'm gonna get what's mine
See, I don't have the time for the haters

And all the time that I wasted
How careless of me
Too young and stupid to see
I put my life in their hands
(Gonna look for Cupid, man)

Oh and I know that they want me to hate them
There's no hurry for now
I'll just have to be the bigger man, see

Dancin', dancin' with the freaks now
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun, in here
What you sow is what you reap now
I'll do my dance with everyone

I've been getting too much sun
If I turn the other cheek now
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them?
Look who's talking guilty feet now

Then, let me tell you people it's an easier affair
Not livin' my life with other people on my mind
No, got nothing to hide from anyone

'Cos I'm walking on new air just living my life
Better believe, I'm gonna get what's mine
See, I don't have the time for the haters

Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong that you won't find love
Don't let them use my life to put your future down
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found

Sticks and stones won't kill the boner
That I have for my life, yeah
Take it to the streets, there are stories you can keep
They're just passing you by

Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong that you won't find love
Don't let them use my life to put your future down
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found

And I'm loving it, everyday of it
Everyday's just the way I want to live
And my heart is full and I know for sure

Love will always win, everyday of it
Everyday's just the way I want to live
And my heart is full and I know for sure
