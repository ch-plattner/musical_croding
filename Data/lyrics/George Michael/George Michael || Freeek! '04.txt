You got yourself some action
Said you got yourself a body
You got yourself an ass with a mind of its own
Brings something to the party

You got yourself addicted
You shoot off, it saves you time
You got yourself a pay cheque
Faces in the places where the sun don't shine

I'll be your sexual freak (freak), of the week
I'll be your inspirational brother (sister), yo momma can't you see
I'll be your sexual freak of the week (Ohh touch it)
I'll be your educational lover, your one fuck fantasy

Can I come on in, my sweet baby, can I move on in
Can I come on in, my sweet baby, can I move on in

You got yourself some action
Said you got your sexy Java
You got your speed connection
Free chat, fuck that, get a little harder

You got yourself a big bed
You shoot off, but take your time
In the house with a bitch and a mouse
And your daddy's plastic, how fantastic yeah

I'll be your sexual freak (Back up on this), of the week
(Yeah...I think I need to re-booty)
I'll be your inspirational brother (sister), yo momma can't you see
I'll be your sexual freak (B, B, Back), of the week
(B, B, push back, sexy mama) 
I'll be your educational lover (Yeah), your one fuck fantasy

Can I come on in, my sweet baby, can I move on in
Can I come on in, my sweet baby, can I move on in

Sexual freak (sister)
I think I need to re-booty
Sexual freak (sister)

I'll be your sexual freak, of the week (You're such a sexy mama)
I'll be your inspirational brother (sister), yo momma can't you see
(I think I need to re-booty)
I'll be your sexual freak
I'll be your educational lover, your one fuck fantasy
Sister, sexual freak
Inspirational brother

You got yourself some action
Said you got yourself a body
You got yourself an ass with a mind of its own
Brings something to the party

Come on kids, don't be scared
It's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared
Come on kids, don't be scared
It's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared
Come on kids, you know your mama and your daddy don't care
Don't be scared, it's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared.
