You've Changed 
That sparkle in your eyes has gone 
Your smile is just a careless yawn 
You're breaking my heart, you've changed 

You've changed 
Your kisses are now so blase 
You're bored with me in every way 
I can't understand you've changed 

You've forgotten the word i love you 
Each memory that we've shared 
You ignore every star above you 
I can't realise you ever cared 

You've changed 
You're not the anges i once knew 
No need to tell me that we're through 
It's all over now, you've changed 

You've forgotten the word i love you 
Each memory that we've shared 
You ignore every star above you 
I can't realise you ever cared 

You've changed 
You're not the anges i once knew 
No need to tell me that we're through 
It's all over now, you've changed 
I miss you
