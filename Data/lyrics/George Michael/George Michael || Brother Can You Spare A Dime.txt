Once I Built A Railroad, Made It Run 
Made it race against time 
Once i built a rairoad, now it's done 
Brother can you spare a dime? 
Once i built a tower to the sun 
Brick and rivet and lime 
Once i built a tower, now it's done 
Brother can you spare a dime? 

Once in khaki suits 
Gee, we looked swell 
Full of that yankee doodle de dum 
Half a million boots went slogging through hell 
I was the kid with the drum 
Say don't you remember, they called me al 
It was al all the time 
Say don't you remember, i'm your pal! 
Buddy can you spare a dime?
