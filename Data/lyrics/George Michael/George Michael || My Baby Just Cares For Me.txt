
My Baby Don't Care For Shows 
My baby don't care for clothes 
My baby just cares for me 

My baby don't care for cars and races 
My baby don't care for high tone places 

Elizabeth taylor is not his style 
And even ricky martin's smile 
Is something he can't see 
My baby don't care who knows it 
My baby just cares for me 

I wonder what's wrong with baby 
My baby just cares for 
He just says his prayers for 
My baby just cares 
For me
