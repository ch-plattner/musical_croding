[George:]
Don't kiss me, darling 
I want you to hear the things I say 
I loved you in my way 
But you know I'm gonna leave you 
[Mutya:]
The clock was always ticking 
And your heart, 
Yes I know your heart is always on the run 
[George:]
I hate what I've become 
But I'm still gonna leave you 
And I don't think you should stay for the night 
[Mutya:]
Baby you know that my flesh is weak 
You know I simply 

[Both:]
I cannot sleep without you 
My heart has simply nowhere to go 

[Mutya:]
Nothing to hold 
Those tears you're crying 

[George:]
Time and time again you take me back in baby 

[Mutya:]
You don't have to make it plain 

[Both:]
This is not real love 

[Mutya:]
Look at us dancing baby 
Let's dance and show them all 
(Dance and show them all) 
How close we are 
The lies have worked so far 
So we go on deceiving 

[George:]
But darling don't you know the time 
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
That's why I've got to leave 

[Both:]
And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
I simply I cannot sleep without you 
But someday I'll have nothing to show 
(Nothing to show) 
(Nothing to show) 
I've nothing to hold 

[George:]
Oh, baby, crying 
All those simple things that won't come again 
Oh do I have to make it plain 
This is not real love 
And I said this is not real love 

[Mutya:]
Real love 
Baby it don't listen and shine the way it used to 

[George:]
This is not real love (real love) 
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you 
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
I have to set you free 
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now 
You should be with someone, someone 

[Mutya:]
Glisten and shine 
You promised me 

[George:]
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me 

[Mutya:]
Where will I go, what do I know 
About life without you 
You promised me you'd never leave me, no 
This is not real love
