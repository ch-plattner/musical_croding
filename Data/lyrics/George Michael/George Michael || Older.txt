
I should have known
It seemed too easy
You were there
And i was breathing blue

Strange
Don't you think i'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger
You have yet to know

Well you're out of time
I'm letting go
You'll be fine
Well that much i know
You're out of time
I'm letting go
I'm not the man you want

I should have known
It seemed so easy
You were there
I thought i needed you

Strange
Don't you think i'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger
Who never seems to show

Well you're out of time
I'm letting go
You'll be fine
(or maybe you won't)
You're out of time
I'm letting go

I'm not the man that you want

I never should have looked back in your direction
I know that
Just the same old fights again, baby
These are wasted days without affection
I'm not that foolish anymore
