
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

I've never been one
For playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Something like
Bang bang you're dead
Couldn't we just make love instead
Say yes because it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just...

How much - do I have to say
What more - do you have to see
What will it take to make you love me
Well you're not the first
You're not the last
You're not even the one who loves me the best
But all I think about is you

So take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just...

So take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just...

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

Please don't wander from my door

I've never been one
For playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Bang Bang you're dead
Shouldn't we just make love instead
Say yes 'cause it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

So don't bring me down
Won't you give me a break
Somebody give me a break now!

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth
Harsh words can get you into hot water
When people don't understand you baby
I'm always here for you
And I
And I will never bring you down, down, down my baby

Trust me
I want you to trust me
Oh trust me
'Cause I won't bring you down
(Don't bring me down)
I won't bring you down
Do you trust me
Yeah
