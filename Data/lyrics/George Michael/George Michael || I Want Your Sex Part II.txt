
Oh so much love
That you've never seen
Let's make love
Put your trust in me

Don't you listen to what they told you
Because i love you
Let me hold you
Oh

I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind
I'm a gentle lover witn a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind, oh

Come on
I want your sex
Come on, i want your sex
That's right, all night
Oh, i want your sex
I want your... Sex

Sexy baby's
Sexy body
Keeps me guessing
With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is
Will we ever?

Sexy baby's
(sexy baby's)
Sexy body
(sexy body)
Keeps me guessing

With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is
Will we ever?

Together - you and me
