It doesn't really matter that i loved you
How many reasons call
It doesn't really matter at all

It doesn't matter that i failed to
Break down your father's wall
It really doesn't matter at all

Why tell me you don't understand when you do
I thought i had something to say

But it really doesn't matter at all.....

I changed my name
To be rid of the things that i want from you
It's strange
But a name is a name and the truth is the truth

Oh, there is always
Always someone there to remind me

So i learn to live with shame
Tell myself i feel no pain
But i do
And if i have to tell you

Then it really doesn't matter at all.....

And it's no good looking back
Because time's a thief and i believe that
I'm too old for that
We're just saying the things that we have said
Forever

It doesn't really matter that i loved you
How many seasons fall
It's too bad
It really doesn't matter at all
