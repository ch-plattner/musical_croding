Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it -
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?
Why can't you do it
Why do i have to share my baby with a monkey?

Oh i count to ten
But i don't know how and i don't know when
To open my eyes
If you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then -
I've had the rest
Now it's time i had the best
So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Well i'd write your heart a letter
But i think you know me better
If i keep on askin' baby, maybe
I'll get what i'm askin' for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it -
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?
Why can't you do it
Why do i have to share my baby with a monkey?

Oh i hate your friends
But i don't know how and i don't know when
To open your eyes
Yes the monkey's back again
Do you want him now like you did back then?
I tried my best
But your head is such a mess
So i guess that i don't want you anymore

Well you say you care about me
That you just can't do without me
But you keep on dancin' baby
'Til that monkey has you on the floor

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it -
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?
Why can't you do it
Why do i have to share my baby with a monkey?

Don't look now
There's a monkey on your back
Don't look now
There's a monkey on you...
