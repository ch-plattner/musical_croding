Higher, higher
Won't you come with me
Baby gonna get my soul free

Now you and me
I guess we see things differently
We're night and day
A bad connection some would say
And i don't want nothing to change
I don't want nothing to change
Because
When you touch me baby
I don't have no choice
Oh that sweet temptation
In your voice

Higher, higher
Won't you come with me
Baby gonna get my soul free

Now seems to me
Some things have just got to be
The games we play
Break up make-up day by day
And i don't want nothing to change
Said i don't want nothing to change
Because
When you touch me baby
I don't have no choice
Oh that sweet temptation
In your voice

Higher, higher
Won't you come with me
Baby gonna get my soul free
