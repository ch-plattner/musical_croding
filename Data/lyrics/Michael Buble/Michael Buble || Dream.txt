Dream
When you're feeling blue
Dream
That's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So, dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So, dream
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream
When you're feeling blue
Dream
That's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So, dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
For things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream
