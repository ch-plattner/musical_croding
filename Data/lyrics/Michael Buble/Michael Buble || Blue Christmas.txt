I’ll have a blue Christmas without you
I’ll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won’t be the same dear, if you’re not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes are falling
That’s when those blue memories start calling
You’ll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
And I’ll have a blue, blue Christmas

And when those blue snowflakes are falling
That’s when those blue memories start calling
You’ll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
And I’ll have a blue, blue Christmas
Yes, I’ll have a blue Christmas
