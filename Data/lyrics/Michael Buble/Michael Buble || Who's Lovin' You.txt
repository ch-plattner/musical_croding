
When I, I had you
Treated you bad and so wrong my dear
But since, since you went away

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you.

I, I, I, I, I shouldnâ€™t ever,
Never ever made you cry
But girl, since, since you been gone

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you.

Life without love,
It's so lonely, babe.
I don't think, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
All my life, all my life yeah I've been lost to you only
So come on home, baby,
Come on and take it.
All, all I can do, all I can do since you've gone is cry.
And don't you ever wonder or worry your pretty little head about what I will do.

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you.
