And show me you understand
And that something happens to me
That some kind of wonderful

Everytime our little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I want to say
But right words don't come my way

I only know when I'm in your embrace
Then this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
And it's some kind of wonderful

And it's wonderful, baby
It's wonderful
Oh, it's so divine

I know I can't express
Oh, this feeling of tenderness
And there's so much I want to say
Ah but the right words don't come my way

I only know when I'm in your embrace
Then this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
You know it's some kind of wonderful

And it's wonderful, baby
Whoa, it's so divine
Oh baby

And it's wonderful
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I understand
And it's some kind of wonderful

And it's wonderful
Baby, baby, baby, baby please
You know you're some kind of wonderful
Oh baby

So much I want to say
