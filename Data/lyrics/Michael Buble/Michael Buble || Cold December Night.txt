
Stockings are hung with care
As Children sleep with one eye open
Well, now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping.

The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
Old Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful.

Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.

A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
Let's cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that you will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.

They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.

They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours
