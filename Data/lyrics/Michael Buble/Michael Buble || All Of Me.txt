
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips I wanna lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

Your goodbyes left me
with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you?
You took the part
that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

Your goodbyes left me
with eyes that cry
Now I'm lost without you
You took the part
that once was my heart

All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm a mess without you?
You took the part
that used to be my heart
So why not take all of me?
