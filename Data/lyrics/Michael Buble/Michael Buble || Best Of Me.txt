
So many years gone, still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
in one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone, love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
and how you changed the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
you were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one could ever touch me more
and I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending if we can hold on
and I think I've come this far because of you
could be no other love but ours will do

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
you were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one could ever touch me more
and I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

No one could ever touch me more
and I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
That I might have saved the best, the very best, of me for you
