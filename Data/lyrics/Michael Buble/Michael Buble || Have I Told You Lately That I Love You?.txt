Have I told you lately that I love you?
Can I tell you once again, somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.

Have I told you lately, when I'm sleeping,
Every dream I dream is you, somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.

My heart would break in two if I should lose you
It's no good without you, anyhow.
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, my darling, I'm telling you now.

Have I told you how the nights are long when you're not with me?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.

My heart would break in two if I should lose you
It's no good without you, anyhow.

Oh, have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.
My sweet darling, I'm telling you now.
Darling, I'm telling you now.
