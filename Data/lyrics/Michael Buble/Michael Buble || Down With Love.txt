Down with love the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that moon and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love let's liquidate all its friends
The Moon, the June, the roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love, yes take it away, away

Take it away
Take it away
Give it back to the birds and the bees and the Viennese

Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs and down with cupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
Down with love

Ooh, let's go

Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that moon and wrap it in cellophane

Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love, take it away, away

Take it away
Take it away
Give it back to the birds and the bees and the Viennese

Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs and down with cupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
(Brother let's stuff that dove)
Brother let's stuff that dove

Down with love
Down with love
Down with love
Down with love
