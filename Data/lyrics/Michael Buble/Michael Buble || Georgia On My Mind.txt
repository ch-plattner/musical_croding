
Every time my eyes sing that song
I sing for my

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Hey, Georgia, oh, yeah, yeah, Georgia
And a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly, yeah
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Hey, Georgia, I say oh, Georgia
No, no, no peace I find girly
Just an old sweet song, God is this song long
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
Busy road, the road leads back to you now

Oh, Georgia, don't do that, had to know well
No peace I find, won't you hear me now
It's just an old sweet song, I said, oh, I said that
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind, yeah, it won't be so
Keeps Georgia on my mind
You know the little girls that are on my mind

Yes, it is
