
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
But girl can't you see, there's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me, 'cause we're alone now
And I'm singing my song for you, you taught me precious secrets
The truth with holding nothing, you came out in front
And I was hiding, oh, but now I'm so much better,
So if my words don't come together, listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life
You are a friend of mine, and when my life is over
Remember, remember, remember when we were together
And we are alone now, and I was singing this song to you
We were alone, and I was singing, yeah singing
We were alone, and I was singing this song for you
Singing my song, I'm singing my song for you
