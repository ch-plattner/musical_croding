
You make me feel so young
You make me feel as spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Runnin' around the meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung, 
bells to be rung, 
and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young

You make me young
You make me feel as spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce at the moon
Like a big balloon

Because, you and I are just like a couple of tots
Runnin' across the meadow

You make me young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung, 
bells to be rung, 
and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so 
'Cause you make me feel so young...
