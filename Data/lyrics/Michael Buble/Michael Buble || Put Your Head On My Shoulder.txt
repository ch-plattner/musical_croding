
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too.

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss good-night
Maybe you and I will fall in love.

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win.
If there's a way
I'll find it some day
And then this fool will rush in.

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear baby
Words I want to hear tell me
Tell me that you love me too.

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear baby
Put your head on my shoulder.
