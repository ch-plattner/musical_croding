Spiderman, Spiderman, 
Does whatever a spider can. 
Spins a web, any size. 
Catches thieves- just like flies. 
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman. 

Is he strong? Listen, bud. 
He's got radioactive blood. 
Can he swing, from a thread? 
Take a look overhead. 
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman! 

In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime, 
like a streak of light, 
he arrives, just in time! 

Spiderman, Spiderman, 
friendly neighborhood Spiderman. 
Wealth and fame? He's ignored. 
Action is his reward. 
Look out! There goes the Spiderman!

Spiderman, Spiderman, 
friendly neighborhood Spiderman. 
Wealth and fame? He's ignored 
(He's Ignored)
Action is his reward. 
Look out! (LOOK OUT!) 
Here comes the Spiderman!

In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime, 
like a streak of light, 
he arrives, just in time! 

Spiderman, Spiderman, 
Does whatever a spider can. 
Spins a web, any size. 
Catches thieves- just like flies. 
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman. 

Spiderman, Spiderman, 
friendly neighborhood Spiderman. 
Wealth and fame? He's ignored. 
Action is his reward. 
Look out! 
Here comes the Spiderman!!!!!!!!
