It can happen to you
When you're young at heart

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
When you're young at heart

You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams
Fall apart at the seams

And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

For as rich as you are
It's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive 'til 105
Look at all you've derived out of being alive
And here is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among of very young at heart

And if you should survive 'til 105
Look at all you've derived out of being alive
And here is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among of very young at heart
