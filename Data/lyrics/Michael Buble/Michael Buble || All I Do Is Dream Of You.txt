
All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin' of you

You're every thought, you're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn and spring

And were there more than twenty-four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away

When skies are gray, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

Oh slow down
When sky's are gray, even when they're are blue
And were there more than twenty-four hours in a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away
When sky's are gray, When sky's are blue, in the morning

All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you

When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue
In the morning (and nighttime too)
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
