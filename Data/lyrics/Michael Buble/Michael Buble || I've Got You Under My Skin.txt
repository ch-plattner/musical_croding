I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
You're so deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
And I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not give in
You know I said to myself this affair ain't gonna go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
That I've got you way under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night and repeats in my ear don't you know you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, step up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you, you're under my skin

[Instrumental bridge]

I'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats, how it yells in these ears
Don't you know, you fool
No chance to win, why not use your mentality?
Wake up, step up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you makes me
Stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
And I love you under my skin.
