
I can't stand still
I'm looking for something
And that something is you

You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold
But all that really matters
Are the things that we do
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You

But I can't stand still
I'm so excited, I just wanna scream
I see you right before me
And it's like a real good dream

But I want you to know something, Baby
Yes, it's really true
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You

I can't stand still
I'm looking for something
And that something is you

You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold
But all that really matters
Are the things that we do
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
