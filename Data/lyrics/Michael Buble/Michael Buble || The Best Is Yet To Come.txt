Out of the tree of life, I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still its a real good bet, the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, and baby wont it be fine
You think you've seen the sun, but you aint seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You aint seen nothin yet

The best is yet to come, and baby wont it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine

The best is yet to come
Come the day your mine
Oh come the day your mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain that cup dry

Wait till your charms are right, for the arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but you aint left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I hold you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
There ain't nothin like it here

The best is yet to come, and baby wont it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine
Come the day your mine
I've got plans for you baby
And baby you're gonna fly
