
I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her, that's where I belong
I'm running to her like a river's song

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache in the night like a thief

Give me love, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme crazy love
Give me love, love, love, yes sir, crazy love

Yes, I need her in the daytime
Yes, I need her in the night
But I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her an' hug her, kiss her an' hug her tight
Kiss her an' hug her tight, through the night

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
It'll make me feel righteous, make me feel whole
Make me feel mellow down into my soul

Give me love, gimme love, yes sir, crazy love
Give me love, gimme, gimme, gimme, crazy love

I said she gives me love, love, love, aww, crazy love
She gives me, yeah, crazy love

I said give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, yes sir, a crazy love, one more time

She gives me love, love, love, love, she gives me crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, yes sir crazy love
