
I never cared much for moonlit skies,
I never winked back at fireflies,
But now that the stars are in your eyes,
I'm beginning to see the light.

I never went in for afterglow,
Or candle light on the Mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low,
I'm beginning to see the light.

I used to ramble through the park,
Shadow boxing in the dark,
Then you came and caused a spark,
That's a four-alarm fire now.

I never made love by lantern shine,
I never saw rainbows in my wine,
But now that your lips are burning mine,
I'm beginning to see the light.

Ooh that light,
I'm beginning to see the light.
