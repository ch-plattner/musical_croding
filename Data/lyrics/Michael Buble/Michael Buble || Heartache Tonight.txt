
Somebodys gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebodys gonna come undone.
Theres nothin we can do.
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night.
Everybody wants to take a little chance,
Make it come out right.

Theres gonna be a heartache tonight,
A heartache tonight, I know.
Theres gonna be a heartache tonight, I know.
Lord, I know.

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks cant hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now.
Theres too much goin on.

This night is gonna last forever.
Last all, last all summer long.
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song.
Theres gonna be a heartache tonight,
A heartache tonight, I know.
Theres gonna be a heartache tonight,
A heartache tonight, I know.
Lord I know.

Theres gonna be a heartache tonight,
The moons shinin bright
So turn out the light, and well get it right.
Theres gonna be a heartache tonight, a
Heartache tonight I know.
Heartache baby,

Somebodys gonna hurt someone, (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebodys gonna come undone,
Theres nothin we can do
(everybody) everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right

Theres gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Theres gonna be a heartache tonight,
A heartache tonight ,i know
Lets go.
We can beat around the bushes;
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin lot,
But either way, theres gonna be a
Heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.
Therell be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know.
