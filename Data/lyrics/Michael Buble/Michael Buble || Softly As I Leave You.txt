
Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me
Long before your arms beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So, softly as I leave you there

Softly, long before you kiss me
long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So, softly as I leave you there
As I leave I you there
As I leave I you there
