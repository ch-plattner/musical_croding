Never been in trouble,
I never got hurt.
Never had to struggle,
I never had to work hard for anything before, believe me!
Lord, I've got it easy!

I feel guilty a little, I've been given so much
People are dying in the dark while I'm lying in the sun
And I sleep like a baby every night
It seems I'm having the sweetest dreams!
I can say honestly, I got it easy!

Now I'm not trying to brag about it
Just wanna say I appreciate it completely
And when I'm acting a fool, you're never cruel to me!
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

It probably isn't much fun to be alone
I wouldn't know, cause I've got you here, keeping me afloat
And when I'm lost, you set me straight
Sometimes I need it
You raise me up, babe!
I got it easy!

Oh, some people drown in here, while I'm walking is only knee deep
I don't mind it a bit on this cold rainy evening
I roll over in bed, got a beautiful woman beneath me every night
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

The world is wide open to me
But it's you that completes me, yeah.
Lord, I got it easy!
