
Well now it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips for fire to melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts that are cookin' to make a fie grow
And baby you've got what it takes

You know it takes alot of kissin' to make a romance sweet
Oh it takes alot of lovin' to make my life complete
Oh well it takes somebedy special to knock me off my feet
And baby you've got what it takes

I said ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Aha ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more effort to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes

Aha ohhhhhhhhhhh

You know know you've got just what it takes

Because it takes alot of effort to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes

C'mon say that again honey

You've got what it takes [x5]
