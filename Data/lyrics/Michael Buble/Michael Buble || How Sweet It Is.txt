
Needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
Needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Touching my emotions

I wanna stop
And thank you baby
I just wanna stop
And thank you baby
Whoa Oh Yeah

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life?
Everything I did was such a bore
Everywhere I went you know
I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I wanna stop
And thank you baby
I just wanna stop and thank you baby
Whoa, oh

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me there is you and there ain't nobody else
I wanna stop
And thank you baby
I just wanna stop
And thank you baby
Oh, whoa, oh

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
