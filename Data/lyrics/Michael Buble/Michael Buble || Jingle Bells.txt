- Merry Christmas, Mr. Buble
- Are you ready to sing a little Jingle Bells?
- Yeeeees

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what a lotta fun, what a lotta fun to ride and sing
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)
In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh)
O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go, we go)
Laughing all the way (all the way)
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun in one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way)
