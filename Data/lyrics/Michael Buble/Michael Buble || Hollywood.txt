Could you be a teenage idol?
Could you be a movie star?
When I turn on my TV, will you smile and wave at me,
telling Oprah who you are?
So you want to be a rock star,
with blue-eyed bunnies in your bed?
Well, remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this,
you'll be famous 'cause you're dead

So don't go higher for desire
Put in in your head,
baby, Hollywood is dead,
you can find it in yourself

I don't want to take you dancin'
when you're dancin' with the world
You can flush your caviar and your million dollar car,
I don't need that kind of girl
But could you be the next sensation?
Will you set the latest style?
You don't need a catchy song
'cause the kids'll sing along when you sell it with a smile

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head,
baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself.
So don't fly higher for your fire
Put in your head,
baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself.

Na na na na na na (Keep it in your head, Hollywood is dead)

Well, you can do the money tango
You can start your little band
You can swing from vine to vine while the cuties wait in line
with the money in their hands
But if you get to California, save a piece of gold for me.
And it's the only thing you'll save,
but I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on TV.

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head,
baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself.
So don't fly higher for your fire.
Put it in your head,
baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself.
Keep on lovin' what is true and the world will come to you,
you can find it in yourself
Love what is true and the world will come to you,
you can find it in yourself
No no no no no...
