
Maybe I’m right and maybe I’m wrong,
Well maybe I’m weak and maybe I’m strong.
But nevertheless I’m in love with you.

Now maybe I’ll win and maybe I’ll lose,
Well, maybe I’m in for crying the blues.
But nevertheless I’m in love with you.

Somehow I know at a glance the terrible chances I’m taking
Fine at the start that left with a heart that is breaking.
Maybe I’ll live a life of regret,
And maybe I’ll give so much more than I get,
But nevertheless I’m in love with you.

Somehow I know at a glance the terrible terrible chances I’m taking
Fine at the start but then left with a heart that is breaking
Maybe I’ll live a life of regret
And maybe I’ll give much more than I get
But nevertheless I’m in love with you.
