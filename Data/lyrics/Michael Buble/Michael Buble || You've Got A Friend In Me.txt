
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
Baby you've got a friend in me
You've got a pal in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got your troubles, I've got em too
There isn't anything, I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and see it through
Cause you've got a friend in me
Darling, you've got a friend in me

Now some of the boys might be
A little smarter than me
Or bigger and stronger, too
Baby none of them is ever gonna love you
The way I do
Oh it's me and you know
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see, it's our destiny
Cause you've got a friend in me
My baby you've got a friend in me

Now some of the boys might be
A little smarter than I am
Or bigger and stronger, too
Baby none of them is ever gonna love you
The way I do
Oh it's me and you know
And as the years go by
Our love will never die
You're gonna see, it's our destiny
Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
My darling, you've got a friend in me
