It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."

[Ivan Lins solo]

I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.

And then I tell her as I turn off the lights
Darling, I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight
I say my darling you were wonderful tonight
