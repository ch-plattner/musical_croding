Someone to care
Someone to share
Those lonely hours
And moments of despair

To be loved
To be loved
Oh
What a feeling
To be loved
Yeah

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved
To be loved
Oh
What a feeling
To be loved
Ooh

Some wish to be
A king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be truly,
Truly, truly loved (just a little more)
Well, it's more (just a little more)
Than any one of those things (just a little bit more)

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved
To be loved
Oh
What a feeling
To be loved

Oh
But to be
Truly loved, baby (just a little more)
There's more (just a little more)
One of these things (just a little more)

Someone to miss
Oh someone to kiss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved
To be loved
Oh
What a feeling
To be loved
To be loved

To be loved
To be loved
Ooh
What a feeling
To be loved
