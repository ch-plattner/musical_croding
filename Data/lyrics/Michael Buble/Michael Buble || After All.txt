
Way back when we started
There was a part of me that knew
One day there'd be heartache
And I would lose myself to you

And I walked all night
Lost in the silent city lights
Thinking of you
Wondering will I lose my mind

After all I'm excited
That you're in my life again
After all I'm delighted
To be back where we began
I believe that you can
Fall in love with me again
And we'll both be standin' tall
After all

Way back when we started
There was a part of you that knew
I was all that you wanted
But only shadows filled the room

I was lost all right
Lost in the sleepless empty nights
Dreamin' of you
And in those dreams you were mine

After all we're united
Yeah, you're in my arms again
After all I'm delighted
'Cause we're lovers and we're friends
I believe that I can
Fall in love with you again
And I'll catch you when you fall
After all

I was lost all right
Lost in the sleepless empty night
Dreamin' of you
And in those dreams you still were mine

After all I'm excited
That you're in my life again
After all I'm delighted
To be back where we began
I believe that you can
Fall in love with me again
'Cause I love you.
I'll catch you when you fall

Oh, we're united
And we've made it after all
And we'll both be standing tall
After all
After all, babe
Oh, after all
After all
After all
