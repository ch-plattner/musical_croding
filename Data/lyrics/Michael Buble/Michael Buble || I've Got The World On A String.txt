(Hey Michael come on & swing.
Looks like you got the world on a string.)

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life - I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see - I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, What a world, what a life - I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let her go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life
Oh, what a world, what life
What a world, what life, cause I'm in love
(He's in love, he's in love)
I'm in love
(Got the world on a string)
And what a wonderful thing
(Alright)
When you get the world on a string
(Uh huh)
