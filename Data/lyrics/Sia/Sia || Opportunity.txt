
Under the glow, of the very bright lights
I turn my face towards the warm night sky
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes
When they're above
Five hundred smiles

Oh I used to think (Oh she used to think)
What wouldn't I give (What wouldn't she give)
For a moment like this (A moment like this)
This moment this gift

Oh, now look at me
And this opportunity
Is standing right in front of me
But one thing I know
It's only part-luck and so
I'm putting on my best show
Under the spotlight
I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, you see

Now I find myself here, and it's time
This is real, an it's a gold mine
I'm not afraid to fly
When it's above
Five hundred smiles

Oh I used to think (Oh she used to think)
What wouldn't I give (What wouldn't she give)
For a moment like this (A moment like this)
This moment is gift

And now look at me and this opportunity
Is standing right in front of me
But one thing I know
It's only part-luck an so
I'm putting on my best show
Under the spotlight
I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So, look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, you see

My big opportunity
I won't waste it

I guarantee
