
Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty 
Sound of their breath fades with the light 
I think about the loveless fascination 
Under the milky way tonight 

Lower the curtain down in Memphis 
Lower the curtain down all right 
I got no time for private consultation, yeah 
Under the milky way tonight 

I wish I knew what you were looking for 
I might have known what you would find 

And there's something quite peculiar 
Something shimmering and white 
Leads you here despite your destination 
Under the milky way tonight 

I wish I knew what you were looking for 
I might have known what you would find 
I wish I knew what you were looking for 
I might have known what you would find 

Under the milky way tonight 
Under the milky way tonight 

I wish I knew what you were looking for 
I might have known what you would find 
I wish I knew what you were looking for 
I might have known what you would find 

The milky way tonight 
Under the milky way tonight 
Ohhh, under the milky way tonight 
Under the milky way tonight 

Under the milky way tonight 
Under the milky way tonight...
