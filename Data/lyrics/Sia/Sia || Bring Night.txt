Bring a little bit of dance bring a little bit of song! Yea! 
Bring Night! Bring the night on!
I'm not sure I can wait and this day has felt so long. Yea. 
Bring Night! Bring the night on!
The music cuts into me and I know it can't be wrong. Yea 
Bring Night! Bring the night on!
Cuz all that we are after is alittle bit of fun. Yea 

Chase your shadow til the sun goes down.
Chase your shadow til the sun goes down. 

Ooohh oooohh whoooa ohhhh whoooa ohhhh ahhh 

Bring Night! Bring the night on!
Bring me the moon and stars and send away the sun. Yea 

Bring Night! Bring the night on!
Or maybe if I'm lucky I'll end up in your arms. 

Chase your shadow til the sun goes down!
Chase your shadow til the sun goes down! 

Ooohh oooohh whoooa ohhhh whoooa ohhhh ahhh 

Chase your shadow til the sun goes down!
Chase your shadow til the sun goes down! 

Chase your shadow til the sun goes down!
