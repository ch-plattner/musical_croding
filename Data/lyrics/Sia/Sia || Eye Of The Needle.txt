
Take me down
I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone
And I ain't ready
And I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you in my arms
In my arms, in my arms

Whoa

[Chorus:]
And you're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

Step and repeat
Whoa
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through the pain
Feel the acid rain
And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you in my arms
In my arms, in my arms

Whoa

[Chorus:]
And you're locked inside my heart
Whoa
And your melody's an art
Whoa
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

[Bridge:]
My bags heavy
Been filled by me
They weigh me down
Carry them 'round
It's all mine all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle

[Chorus:]
And you're locked inside my heart
Whoa
And your melody's an art
Whoa
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle
Eye of the needle
And you're locked inside my heart
Whoa
And your melody's an art
Whoa
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

Oh oh
Whoa
Oh oh
Whoa yeah
