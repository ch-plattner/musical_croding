
Someone plugged you in
And sadly they clipped your wings
Now you can't fly away electric bird
Yeah someone took your tweet
One day they fed you that bad seed
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic

Got to set you free, you were blinded by deceit
You can't fly away electric bird
So now this rooms all staged
While you're stuck there in that cage
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic
