All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
[x2]

I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
Oh such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
