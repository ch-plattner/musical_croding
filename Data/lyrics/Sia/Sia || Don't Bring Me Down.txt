
Faint light of dawn 
I'm listening to you breathing in and breathing out 
Needing nothing 
You're honey dipped 
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world 
I can't feel my lips 

I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down 

Then all of that's annulled and I'm ayone's everyone's 
We are one 
Your face becomes the sun 
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things 
Those little things 
The little things they bring 

I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down 

So now for restless mind, I could go either way 

I'm going down, I don't wanna change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg of you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, don't let me
