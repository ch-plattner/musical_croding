
Come along it is the break of day
Surely now, you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me

So come along, it won't be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine
Work it out yeah we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate

So come along, it won't be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

Oh yeah
Oh
Oh..

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found, oh

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

I know we're lost but soon we'll be found [3x]
