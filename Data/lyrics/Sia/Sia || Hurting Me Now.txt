You, you don't like my hair
You don't like what I wear
I'm trying, trying, you see I'm trying
Why you try to change me all the time?
You, you say I talk too much
I know it drives you nuts
You tell me you wish I was better, better, yeah
You roll your eyes forgetting I am in a room

[Chorus:]
You're hurting me now, you take me down, you don't even know it
You think it's a joke but, baby, you don't, you don't even know it
You're hurting me now, you take me down, you don't even know it
You think it's a joke but, baby, you don't, you don't even know it

You, you say I sing too loud
I want you to be proud
I want you screaming out, "That girl is mine, I love her, love her,"
But you've already tuned me out
You, you know these words you say
Are causing us decay
You feel like I'm withdrawing
I am running away
You're pushing, you're pushing me

[Chorus]

[Bridge x4:]
Don't want you to blow it, you're hurting me
I know you don't know it

[Chorus]
