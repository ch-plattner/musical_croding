For those who've slept 
For those who've kept 
Themselves jacked up 
How Jesus wept 
Sunday 
Sunday 

For those in need 
For those who speed 
For those who try to slow their minds with weed 
Sunday 
Sunday 

For those who wake 
With a blind headache 
Who must be still 
Who will sit and wait 
For sunday, to be monday 

Yeah, it will be ok 
Do nothing today 
Give yourself a break 
Let your imagination run away 

For those with guilt 
For those who wilt 
Under pressure 
No tears over spilt milk 
Sunday 
Sunday 

Sunday 
Sunday 

Sunday 
Sunday 

Yeah, it will be ok 
Do nothing today 
Give yourself a break 
Let your imagination runaway 

Yeah, it will be ok 
Do nothing today 
Give yourself a break 
Let your imagination runaway
