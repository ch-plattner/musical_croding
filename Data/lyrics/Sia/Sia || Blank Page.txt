I missed, for a lot to you
Dear (Dear)
I missed you. You were right, you'll knew 
Dear (Dear)

But I was scared, I was unprepared
Ooh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through
Draw me a smile and save me tonight
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart, let me be your art
I am a blank page waiting for life to start

And let our hearts stop and beat as one together

I'm goin' tell you what was wrong
Dear (Dear)
Start Again, Friends and New Sketch
Dear (Dear) 

But I was scared, I was unprepared
Ooh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through
Draw me a smile and save me tonight
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart, let me be your art
I am a blank page waiting for life to start

And let our hearts stop and beat as one together
Let out hearts stop and beat as one forever

Draw me a smile and save me tonight
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart, let me be your art
I am a blank page waiting for life to start

Let them beat as one together
Let them beat as one together
