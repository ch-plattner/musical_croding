What I mean is I need the good things
I'm finding the light in the good things
I've might need help to see the good things
Oh

Shake me out of my misery, woah woah, oh, oh
Oh, oh, make me
Get out and wiggle it, oh, oh, oh

Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life
And we only get once chance
Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love

Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life
And we only get once chance
Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands

I'm trying to fly in the good things
I'm finding this might be a good thing

Shake me out of my misery woah, oh, oh
Oh, oh, make me
Get out and wiggle it oh, oh, oh

Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life
And we only get once chance
Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love

Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life
And we only get once chance
Oh, Clap Your Hands, Clap Your Hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
