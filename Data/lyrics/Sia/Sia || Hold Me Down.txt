Could never met the kind, that keeps these thoughts I lie in, turn out on the spot, watch it all pass by 
I, lie, here, awaiting for the tears, while I pass the years 
I kinda seemed to move, nothing more to lose, waiting in the base, that we used to use 
I, lie, here, awaiting for the tears, while I pass the years 

[Chorus: x4]
You hold me down 

It's dirty like it is, everything's a mess, I can only save, but your last kiss 
I, lie, here, awaiting for the tears, while I pass the years 
I cannot show my face, blurred in your embrace, I am controlling, your taste 
I, lie, here, awaiting for the tears, while I pass the years 

[Chorus: x4]
You hold me down 

These memories 
Weigh on me 
Make believe 
Sets me free 
I long for you 

[Chorus: x12]
You hold me down
