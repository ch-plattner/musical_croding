
We are born 
Without a care 
As we grow old 
But unaware 
As we grow tall 
Begin to falter 
We want to know ourselves 
Spread love to all 

But we fall down cause we are human 
Yes sweet anger will feed the hunger 
Yes we push through 
Just me and you 

[Chorus] 
We made it through the darkness to the light 
Uh huh we fought 
But still we won the fight 
Oh yes, we stand to gain love 

A fantasy for you and me 
A beauty light and reality 
No need to feel 
The proof that something 
For all of it is love and harmony 

But we falter and yes we are flawed 
As we play victim to such conviction 
And breathe heavily 
Both you and me 

[Chorus]

For the day by day 
Worried we would fail 
How we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in pain 
Took it step by step 
We could not forget the wounds we felt 
And how we screamed for help 
From the dark, dark nights when you held me tight 
And we prayed for light to rescue us 
Yeah, we were distressed 
Now we're nothing less 
We are strong 
We are blessed 
We are united 

[Chorus x2]
