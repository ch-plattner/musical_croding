This is a game already won
The time has come
Stop trying

Take a break
You must be tired from the strain
Take a break
I might ask our pain
Please, slow down
You are making my head spin
Please, slow down
You have all I have to give

This is a game already won
The time has come
Stop trying

You don’t know
You have everything you need
You won’t grow till you get down on your knees
Say goodbye and do not dissect your life
Say goodbye, there’s no need to apologize
