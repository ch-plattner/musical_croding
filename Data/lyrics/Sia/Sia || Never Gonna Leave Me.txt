We are anything, but unremarkable 
We found things, that we have given up on 
We were two, peas in a pod 
Oh yeh 

Pleasing me, seven good deeds 
I'm a man of strengths, a man indeed 
We found things, we had given up upon 

Now that you have gone 
I know it wont be long 
You will be waiting for me 
Faithfully 
Baby 

Now I'm taking your love from above 
You're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

Now I'm taking your love from above you're here 
And you're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

You're never gonna leave me 

You touched my heart and then gave me yours 
I was so afraid I tried to ignore all the butterflies, 
Taking me over 

We are anything, but unremarkable 
We found things, that we have given up on 
We found love 

Now that you have gone 
I know it wont be long 
You will be waiting for me 
Faithfully 
Baby 

Now I'm taking your love from above you're here 
And you're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

Now I'm taking your love from above you're here 
And you're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

Your love is never gonna leave me 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

Now that you have gone 
I know it wont be long 
You will be waiting for me 
Faithfully 
Baby 

Now I'm taking your love from above you're here 
And you're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me 

Now I'm taking your love from above you're here 
And you're never gonna leave me 
I will carry you on for so long 
Your love is never gonna leave me
