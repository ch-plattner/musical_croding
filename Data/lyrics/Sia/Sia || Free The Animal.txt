
I love you so
Wanna throw you from the roof
The pressure builds
Wanna put my hands through you
I'll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death
Loving you to death

The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when it's time for you to die

Detonate me
Shoot me like a cannon ball
Granulate me
Kill me like an animal
Decapitate me
Hit me like a baseball
Emancipate me
Free the animal
Free the animal

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Free the animal
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Free the animal
Free the animal

I love you so I'm putting you in quicksand
You take your chances when you kiss the hit-man
The animal's inside of this infinite jest
Loving you to death, loving you to death

The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when it's time for you to die

[2x]
Detonate me
Shoot me like a cannon ball
Granulate me
Kill me like an animal
Decapitate me
Hit me like a baseball
Emancipate me
Free the animal
Free the animal

[2x]
Murder me, ruin me
Look what you do to me
Beautiful pain baby
Pour acid rain on me
Kill me with your loving
Kill me with your loving
I'll slice you and dice you
Like sugar and spice
I'll do all that you want me to be
I'm a beast
And I'll kill you with my with my loving
I'll kill you with my loving

[2x]
Detonate me
Shoot me like a cannon ball
Granulate me
Kill me like an animal
Decapitate me
Hit me like a baseball
Emancipate me
Free the animal
Free the animal

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Free the animal
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Free the animal
Free the animal
Oh oh oh...
