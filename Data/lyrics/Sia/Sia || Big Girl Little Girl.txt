Tearing your way through this huge swirl,
I know you're mad, you're on a war path,
You know you dont want to be bury more

Friends
Then we could be friends,
I wish that we were friends,
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy

Yeah
Oh oh oh oh

Big girl, it's hell being unwell,
You know you're stuck where you fell,
Your words give birth like a rosemary,
You know you dont want to bury more

Friends,
Then we could be friends,
I wish that we were friends,
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy

Friends,
Then we could be friends,
I wish that we were friends,
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy

Can't bury more friends,
Then we could be friends,
I wish that we were friends,
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy

Friends,
Yeah we could be friends,
I wish that we were friends,
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy

You know with every cruel word that you utter,
That you bury yourself even deeper every day,
Oh little girl, theres enough love in this circle,
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain

You know with every cruel word that you utter,
That you bury yourself even deeper every day,
Oh little, girl theres enough love in this circle,
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain

You know with every cruel word that you utter,
That you bury yourself even deeper every day,
Oh little girl, theres enough love in this circle,
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain
