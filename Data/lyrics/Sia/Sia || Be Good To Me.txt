Yeah, ay, ay

He said, "Darling don't forget
There is sweetness left on earth for you and me"
He says, "Honey, no regrets"
We just do our best and die,
I just wanna cry 'cause you'll be

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever oh ooooh
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather

He says, this is just today
It will be okay, and I, I am listening
He says, you can trust in me
You'll get all you'll need and how can I doubt you?
'Cause you'll be

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather

You know what you do to me
You light up,
Light up the dark and
You're all the good within me
My heart is filled, rebuilt

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
