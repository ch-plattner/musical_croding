It's funny that way, you can get used 
To the tears and the pain 
What a child will believe 
You never loved me 

[Chorus:] 
You can't hurt me now 
I got away from you, I never thought I would 
You can't make me cry, you once had the power 
I never felt so good about myself 

Seems like yesterday 
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed 
For your anger to end 
Oh Father I have sinned 

[Chorus] 

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way 
You never wanted to hurt me 
Why am I running away 
[Repeat] 

Maybe someday 
When I look back I'll be able to say 
You didn't mean to be cruel 
Somebody hurt you too
