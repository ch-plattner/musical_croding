Fancy, a big house
Some kids and a horse
I cannot cry
But nearly guarantee a divorce

I think that I love you
I think that I do
So go on Mister
Make Miss Me, Mrs. You

I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth

Fancy, a fast car
A bag full of loot
I can nearly guarantee
You'll end up with the boot

I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth

I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth
From the truth, from the truth
From the truth, from the truth
