
You got me pushing imaginary buttons
Step away from me lover, away from me lover
You got me counting imaginary school children
Get away from me lover, away from me lover
Yes I can see that your carpet is animated
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
Yes I see you open wounds in everyone I've dated
Away from me lover, get away from me lover

I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do

You got me turning all the lights on and off
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
When will you see that I am carrying this stuff
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
Can't you see that I am losing my marbles
It's marvellous losing another, losing another

I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do

Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
Get away from me lover, away from me lover
Step away from me lover, away from me lover
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
