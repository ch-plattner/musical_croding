[Verse 1:]
Hey, America
Let's turn it up
Yeah, check out our style
'Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile
Your clothes may be 
Chanel, Gucci
Your shoes crocodile
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus:]
But if you stand for nothing, you'll fall for it all
'Cause we got all we need, got love and more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
'Cause if it's real, you'll open every door
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

[Verse 2:]
Ready or not 
Give all we got
Yeah, you can't deny
That baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile
Don't sink the boat 
When you lose hope
I'll keep you alive
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now look at us
We pick it up
We set it on fire
'Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile
We show it out
We're playing now
We're living the life
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus]

You're never fully dressed without a smile
