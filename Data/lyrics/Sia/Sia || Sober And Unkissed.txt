
Like a new winter's coat 
I'm wearing your last embrace 
Like a cold quenching glass of water 
I hold a clear picture of your face 

When are you coming around 
Oh when are you coming around 
Cos soon I'll be cold and thirsty 

I'm hearing your last telephone call 
Ringing louder and clearer than 
The rest 
I hear your invitation to see it all 
Better written I am smitten no 
Protest 

So when are you coming around 
Oh when are you coming around 
Cos soon I'll be bored and lonely 

I'm tasting the last glass of yor wine 
The sweet taste linger left on lips 
I'm tasting your sweet kisses with mine 
The sweet taste lingers left on lips 

So when are you coming around 
Oh when are you coming around 
Cos soon I'll be sober and unkissed.
