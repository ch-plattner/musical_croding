
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for life
I trust that I will be alright
I'm ready for us, I'm ready tonight
Catch me, I'm your butterfly
The feeling is right
No, it can't be wrong
It's what I've been searching for
I think you're the one, I think you're the one
The one that I've been dreaming of

You take my breath away
You got me feeling fade

I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high
I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed

In your embrace I close my eyes
Our love it feels divine
I feel the heat of his skin on mine
You & I are one tonight

You take my breath away
You got me feeling fade

I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high
I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed

I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high
I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed

I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high
I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
