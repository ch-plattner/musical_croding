
I eat food to satisfy my hunger 
I drink water to quench my thirst 
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up 
I prick with pin to watch it burst
To make noise I use my breathe 
To unlock doors I use a key 
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes 
I use booze to unlock me 

I sweep so I can sleep 
I sweep so I can sleep 

Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep 

I wear shoes so I can run 
As to avoid the broken glass 
I wear the pants because they suit me 
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass 
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh 
I'll close the door to have a cry 
They say that change and pain is a positive thing 
Have I changed since you died 

I Sweep so I can sleep 
I Sweep so I can sleep 

Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep 

Don't ask me why I smoke 
I don't know 
But I drink to get drunk 

Don't ask me why I smoke 
I don't know 
But I drink to get drunk 

Don't ask me why I smoke 
I don't know 
But I drink to get drunk 

Don't ask me why I smoke 
I don't know 
But I drink to get drunk
