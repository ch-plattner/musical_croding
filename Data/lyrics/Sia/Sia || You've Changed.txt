
Stealing hearts was your pastime 
I saw girls falling hook line 
You stole kisses and threw them aside 
Hits and misses your love-side 

You've changed for the better 
You've changed for the better 

Making waves was your hobby 
And I asked you to hold me 
And I knew it 
You do it in front of the world 
And I'll end up different from the other girls 

You've changed for the better 
You've changed for the better
