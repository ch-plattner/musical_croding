
We lose 
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love 
Don't cry 
We've all lied 
But there is always room for forgiveness my friend 

So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

Shine 
You're fine 
See I will always have a smile for you my love 
And still 
We will 
Be ok and along the way we'll learn a thing or two 

So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

Don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
So soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

Don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong, where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong, where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me 

Don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong 
I know where I belong 
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete 
There's a place here for you with me
