Watching the sequence of sounds coming out of your mouth
But the snow is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Trying to make out your mood
But my brain doesn't want to

Hi, close the door, silent call
For you
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart

Interpret your eyes as they die
Should I cry? Should I lie?
Your poor lashes blow
Victim of sensory love
You cry all over
An innocent call

Hi, close the door, silent call
For you
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart
