
Don't let love get in the way
Feel the fear and do it anyway
Take a chance, no it wasn't what you know
Take her hand and don't let go

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe

Tell her all of how you feel,
Give her everything she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say come take it
And she will see that you're a good man

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it

Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
