
I am so bored
Think I'm going to die
I'm so empty
I cannot even cry
Crush my eye in your tender hand
The death of romance

I’m grief stricken
Killing time
Amputated, broken smile
I feel so weak
Undignified
I didn't realize

I'm isolated sick with fear
I lost my sight
And cannot hear
Imperfect world, desensitized
Our truth been compromised

I’m so bored
I think I might die
Burned, burnt-out and dried
Oh lord uninspired
Cross my heart I hope to die
