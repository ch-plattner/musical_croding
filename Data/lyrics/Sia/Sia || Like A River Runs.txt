I woke up thinking you were still here
My hands were shaking with regret
I've held this dream for such a long long time
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a rolling drum

I saw you standing on the corner
I saw you standing on your own
I get the feeling that it's all a dream
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a drum

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember your light

Your light it follows me in darkness
I'm trying hard but I can't win
And I've played the victim for a long long time
And I wanna grow up
From the rhythm a young, from the rhythm of a younger heart
It leads just like a river runs

That night I sent over the parkway
The summer's gone and I'm alone
And I get the feeling that you're somewhere close
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of your wild, to the rhythm of your wild heart
It beats, been beating since you've gone

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember your light

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
And I know you're gone, know you're gone
I still remember your light, your light

And if you see me in the darkness
I hope you know I'm not alone
I carry you with every breath I take
I won't let up, I won't let up
Till the wind is gone

Till the wind is gone [x4]
