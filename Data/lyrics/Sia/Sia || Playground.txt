
Come with me to a place of fantasy
I'll take you on a sea-saw
Come with me to a place that's by the sea
I'll take you on a board walk
Take my hand I'll take you to the sand
You and me will build a castle
Ready set go I'll race you to the wall
I will win I am the fastest

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

I'll be sure to write you from the war
Put your guns away it's tea time
Water bombs and tea towel tired mums
Looking for a little me time
Close your eyes and count to thirty five
You may never ever find me
Close my eyes and then I realise
You are never far behind me

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime
I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

Let's have fun, let's play out under the sun
Will you take me by the hand
Let's see how far we can run, yeah
Let's play chase let's put make up on our face
You can catch me if you can
We can make a secret place

Meet me at the playground, come with me, fool around
