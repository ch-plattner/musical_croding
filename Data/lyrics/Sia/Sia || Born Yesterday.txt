
Something’s wrong and I can feel it 
And if the surface tension then breaks 
Then we will drown her in it all 

’Cause you can’t look me in the eye anymore 
But if you do it’s clear inside
You’re fighting in the wood. 

But you can’t hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say 
So hush now and don’t cry, 
Mistakes are a part of life. 

I wasn’t born yesterday 
And I see it on your face. 
I wasn’t born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore. 
You took my heart and now is broke-n. 

So take your things, you gotta go now, 
Don't say a word, or it might go down, go down, go down (Ah ah ah)
And I’ll stay cool until you walk out 
But when you’re gone I’ll lie here hoping that I will not drown 

But you can’t hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say 
So hush now and don’t cry, 
Mistakes are a part of life. 

I wasn’t born yesterday 
And I see it on your face
I wasn’t born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore. 
You took my heart and now is broke-n. 

I ain’t your baby anymore 
Don’t call me baby 
Don’t say a word because I know 
Don’t call me baby 
I ain’t your baby anymore 
Don’t call me baby 
So save the word because I know 
Don’t call me baby
