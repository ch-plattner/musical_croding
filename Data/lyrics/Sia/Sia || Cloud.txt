While aware the hour.
Into something new.
Throw away the flowers.
They make you feel blue.
Throwing stones at stranger.
Waiting for the fight.
Throwing stones at birds who struggle to take flight. 

[Chorus]
I am a dark cloud swelling with hate.
I am a dark cloud swelling with hate. 

Get it out your system.
Get it out of you.
Send them home with blisters.
Send the home with truth.
Send them away the daughters.
Blind them with your hoove try to save the daughters.
Try to sell the news 

[Chorus x3]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus x2]
