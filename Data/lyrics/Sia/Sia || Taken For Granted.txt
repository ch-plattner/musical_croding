
I'm sitting in the car again 
Waiting for you 
You said you'd be a minute 
But you've been twenty two 
See you've got to do your hair 
And get it just right 
Sometimes you're in the bathroom 
For half of the night 

And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 

Now I'm sitting by the phone again 
Waiting for your call 
You'd said you'd phone at two 
And it's a quarter past four 
Now I'm standing out the front 
Again 
It's late at night 
And I'm truly sick to death of 
Sleazy men 
Undressing me with their eyes 

And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Yes I'm waiting for you 
And I'm waiting for you again 
Tell me what can I do 

Now I'm back back from 
The theater 
I watched the show alone 
I waited for you and 
I missed half act one 
Have you never heard 
Of the phone 
I don't like being 
Taken for granted 
I'm too nice for my own good 
See I do what I say 
And i say what I do 
Is it too much to expect 
That you could 
I wish you would 

I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
Go find another fool 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
It's the usual coup 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
May I show you the door 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't waiting for you 
I ain't waiting for you no more 
I ain't missing nothing for you
