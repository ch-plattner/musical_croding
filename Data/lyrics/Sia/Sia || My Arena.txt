Now I can't help but feel foolish and ashamed
I am a broken record, a glitch in your iPod
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody

Baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see

You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on me

Oh no, I let you fool me once
Shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me
Am I a scratched CD? A glitch in your download?
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody?

Baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see

You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on me

Oh baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see, yeah

You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out (I'm doing fine without you)
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating (I'm doing fine without you)
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on me
