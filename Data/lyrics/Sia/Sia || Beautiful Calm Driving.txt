
Beautiful calm driving, deep sea pearl diving
Constantly unwinding, beautiful calm driving
You turned into another
You turned into a nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger
To me

Beautiful calm driving, emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining, beautiful calm driving
You turned into another
You turned into a nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
Beautiful calm driving
