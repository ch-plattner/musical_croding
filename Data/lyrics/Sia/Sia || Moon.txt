I watch you spin from afar 
I drink you in and breath you out 
I'm camouflaged by the timeline 
I'm camouflaged when the sun shines 

Two ships passing in the night 
Two lips pressing ground the tides 

I believe the world it spins for you 
We wil never be, I am the moon 

I believe the world it spins for you 
We wil never be, I am the moon 

I long to be a part 
I isolate my heart 
You've drawn me into your world 
Now I too spin limbless 

One hand clapping, where's the wind 
I stand spanning at your distant wings 

I believe the world it spins for you 
We wil never be, I am the moon 

I believe the world it spins for you 
We wil never be, I am the moon 

I believe the world it spins for you 
We wil never be, I am the moon
