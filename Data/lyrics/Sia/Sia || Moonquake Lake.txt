
She's a fish and he's a boy
Moonquake moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue

She came from the Moon ready to fight
With scales and a tail and a fishy bite
Ready to destroy all of humankind
Fierce and fighting with a brook trout mind

He was born in an airship above the earth
Strong in legend, my soul's in mirth
Son of a mime and a performer
With just a smile for a sweet

They were never meant to meet (put faith in listen)
They were never meant to be (oh it never does)
They were never meant to see (oh but fate didn't listen)
They were never (didn't listen)
She's a fish, he's a boy

Moonquake moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake moonquake
I want to catch you in my net
Now I am awake always
Like the day when I found it

And then one solstice at a fishing hole
He was unsure casting his bowl
She swam right up to him and took the bait
He reeled her in and made it a date

When your worlds are worn, you look inside
Fight the power, stop the divide
Four eyes, two gills, one human nose
Wrap your eyes around me in the river floes

Moonquake moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake moonquake
I want to catch you in my net
Now I am awake always
Like a day when I found it

Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
Moonquake
