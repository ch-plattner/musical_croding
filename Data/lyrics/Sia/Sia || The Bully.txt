
How you been feeling 
It's not about marbles snakes or glue 
How you been healing 
Now that we cannot win or lose 
So how you been keeping 
It doesn't matter whose dads richest now 
How you been sleeping 
From the top bunks further to fall down 

You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 

What you been doing 
Still make the world a better place 
Never stopped rueing 
Making those tears fall down your face 
Making you suffer 
Wondering how you got your scars 
And only in hindsight 
I wish I had taken you in my arms 

Taken you in my arms 
Taken you in my arms 
Taken you in my arms 
Taken you in my arms 

You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me 

You turned that around on me (forgiving the bully) 
You turned that around on me 
You turned that around on me (forgiving the bully)
