You have her pictures
You have her pictures
You have her pictures
Everywhere

You're covered in stitches
You're covered in stitches
You think I can't see them
But I know they're there

Take her down from the wall
I just sell firewall

You can't keep a frozen
Doorman at your court
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone

You lost your big heart
You lost your big heart
You lost your big heart
Beating bare

She gave you a new start
She gave you a new start
But you knew you'd lost her
To despair

Take her down from the wall
I just sell firewall

You can't keep a frozen
Doorman at your court
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone

You skin burns and prickles
You skin burns and prickles
You skin burns and prickles
When she's near

You try to play it cool
You try to play it cool
You try to play it cool
But you're filled with fear

Take her down from the wall
I just sell firewall

You can't keep a frozen
Doorman at your court
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone

Take her down from the wall
Let her go make her yours

You can't keep a frozen
Doorman at your court
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone

You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone

You can try to move on
Or maybe she is the one
