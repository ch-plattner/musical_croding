By the window
Since time began
Watch the wind blow
Sculpting sand

All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling

Burning castle
Turning down
Mr. Prince has lost her crown

All in letters bound in string
Time is slowly unraveling

She sells
Empty sea shells
Lost in the ocean

Through the window
We can see
Sand and biscuits
Cups of tea

All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling

All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling

She sells
Empty sea shells
She sells
Empty sea shells
Lost in the ocean
