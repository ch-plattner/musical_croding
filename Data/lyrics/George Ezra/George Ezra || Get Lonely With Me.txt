
Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me

Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me

Well I do this little thing where I take myself away,
I take myself abroad but it ain't no holiday,
Well I don't need petroleum and I don't need no power,
I don't need no fancy boots to get me from town to town

Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me

Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me

Well I'm making friends with strangers,
making enemies of friends,
When you're living outside the rules there are no rules to bend,
Well I don't need no visitors and I don't need no queen,
I don't need reminding or familiarities

Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me
Get down, get down, get lonely with me,
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down, get down, get ooh

Five times on the wrong train,
Gonna wind up in the right place baby,
Miles away from the dark days he says If you won't forget me, I won't forget you,
Write it down on the hand now,
Don't break that,
It's time now

Ooh get lonely,
Ooh get lonely tonight,
Ooh get lonely,
So get down, get down, get lonely with me
