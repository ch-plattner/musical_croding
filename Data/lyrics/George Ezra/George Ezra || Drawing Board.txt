I'll fill your pillow case up with snakes the man eating kind
Though you call yourself a women I doubted it they will mind,
Ooh my oh, ooh ooh, oh my

There's just one problem with my plan
You spend your nights with another man
Oh you don't rest your head with mine no more
I've got to take my plot back to the drawing board
Ooh my oh, ooh ooh, oh my
Oh my, my

Oh lately, I'm a heartache
I'm a desperate plan in hands oh I'm a blueprint in the sand, oh my

You mentioned taking a holiday and I recalled you couldn't swim
So I booked us scuba diving off the North coast of Belgium
Ooh my oh, ooh ooh, oh my

And I drew an image in my head of you sinking just like lead
But I never found you washed up on the shore,
I've gotta take my plot back to the drawing board
Ooh my oh, ooh ooh, oh my
Oh my, my

Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I'm a desperate plan in hands oh I'm a blueprint in the sand, oh my
Oh, I'm the one that you seldom came to see, oh
I was hidden, oh
I've been busy working on my new scheme, oh
To teach you how to hurt

You said you needed a haircut I recommended Mr Todd
Of all the men in this big bad world heâ€™s perfect for the job

Ooh my oh, ooh ooh, oh my 
Oh my, my

Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I'm a desperate plan in hands oh I'm a blueprint in the sand
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I'm a desperate plan in hands oh I'm a blueprint in the sand
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
And I haven't seen you since so now I'm praying that you're mince, oh my
