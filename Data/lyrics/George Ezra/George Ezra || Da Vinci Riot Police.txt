
Country boys and city girls
Travelling to a foreign world, world
Oh, Da Vinci riot police
Cold War preacher on your street alone, alone

It started when your mother was young,
In every song your father sung
He'd take it and he'd make it your own

Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on
Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on

Call your friends and pack your bags
To the brim, now we're nomads, mad.
European sonic boom, electric chapel - book a room, a room

It started when your mother was young,
With every song your father sung
He'd take it and he'd make it your own

Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on
Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on

It started when your mother was young,
With every song your father sung
He'd take it and he'd make it your own

Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on
Many other roads yet to run
So bind your heart in, back with love
Carry on, carry on
