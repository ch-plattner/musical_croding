Oh the prophets pointed out where I went wrong
Singing wooooo, go figure out your desire,
Wooooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don’t need,
No nothing more,
We’re quite attached to the forty-four,
Take a chance,
Take our words,
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere, wooooo

My mistakes land like embers on your tongue
In the foreground, you’re still busy getting young,
Singing wooooo, go figure out your desire,
Wooooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don’t need,
No nothing more,
We’re quite attached to the forty-four,
Take a chance,
Take our words,
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere singing

Wooooo, go figure out your desire,
Wooooo, my darling, stand by your gun

See we don’t need,
No nothing more,
We’re quite attached to the forty-four,
Take a chance,
Take our words,
We fall down, we go there, we go anywhere, wooooo

How long will you go? will you go? will you go? and
