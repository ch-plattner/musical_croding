There's a lock on my cupboard door,
That I can only reach once inside,
And I often sit and wonder who designed,
Such a perfect place for me to hide

It's just my name,
It's just my skin,
Holding a boulder,
Can you swim?
Oh as we fall,
Through the water,
You find a piece within,
And you know it's just your skin

Well I was never lonely â€˜till the day that I was born,
Since that day I masquerade in a skin that I have worn,
With at least three separate individual minds,
When long John returns he'll give a scream,
and what he finds

Is just my name,
Is just my skin,
Holding a boulder,
Can you swim?
Oh as we fall,
Through the water,
You find a piece within,
And you know it's just your

Black dog, black dog, that I'll never know,
Oh black dog haunts you mind, your world, your soul,
Oh black dog, black dog, can't you see I am fine?
Oh black dog, black dog, you're no plague of mine.

It's just my name,
It's just my skin,
Holding a boulder,
Can you swim?
It's just my name,
Oh, it's just my skin,
Holding a boulder,
Can you swim?
Oh as we fall,
Through the water,
You find a piece within,
And you know it's just your skin.
