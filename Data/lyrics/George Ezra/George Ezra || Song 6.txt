
The modern office building's are chasing the sun
and the wind is racing after the day
And everybody's chasing a beauty they don't have
and I'm, woah I'm, I'm chasing you

The raindrops keep falling, searching for a home
My televisions gasping for air
And everybody's searching, searching for a reason
and I'm, woah I'm, searching for you

We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you

The militant commuters come waiting for the train,
in the longest Bavarian night
And everybody's waiting, waiting for the sunrise
And I'm, woah I'm, waiting for you

We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you [x4]
