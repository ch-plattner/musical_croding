Whoa, why do you treat me so?
Whoa, why do you treat me so?
Well you cause me to weep
And you cause me to mourn
You cause me to pack up my bags and leave home
Whoa, why do you treat me so?

Did you hear the thunder?
Or the rain?
Means I’m coming home again
Means I’m coming home my friend

Did you steal my name?
Oh, you Jack of all trades
You’re the master of none
Oh, the race has begun
I was born a champion 
I was born to jump and run

Did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain?
You can try & run & hide
Tearing at the chain
Oh, Lucifer’s inside

Did your siblings tell you
I was wasting up your time
Oh, now you’re wasting mine
You put me back in line
And I’m counting every link
And I guess you think that’s fine

Did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain?
You can try & run & hide
Tearing at the chain
Oh, Lucifer’s inside

Oh, did I send a shiver 
Down your spine?
Well I do it all the time
It’s a little trick of mine
Did I make you shake your knees
Did I make him spill his wine
Lord, I’m spreading like disease 
Lord, I’m all up in your mind
Oh, Lucifer’s inside
Lucifer’s inside

Did you hear the rain?
Oh, the rain?
You can try & run & hide
Tearing at the chain
Means I’m coming home again
Means I’m coming home my friend
Oh, Lucifer’s inside
Oh, Lucifer’s inside
Oh, Lucifer’s inside.
