
Cassy's got a new plan
Gotta get herself away
Well, I'd better act quick
Yeah, I'd better change my ways

Oh, maybe I'm wasting
Maybe I'm chasing time
Oh, come on, let's face it
I'm only ever lost in mine

Well, I got my tracing paper
So that I could trace my clock
And the bastard face kept changing
And the hands, they wouldn't stop

I was ripping out the battery
I received myself a shock
And to add insult to injury
I could still hear tick & tock

Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave
Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave

Cassy's got a new plan
Gotta get herself a break
And I try, I try, I try
For heaven's sake

Well, I traveled to Australia
And I traveled there by train
This something might sound strange to you
But on the way I gained a day

And I wrote to tell my family
And I wrote to tell my friends
I arrived home, it was lost again
And this torture never ends

Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave
Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please

Inspector, fix me, my Cassy O's burnt out
We're losing memories that I can't replace
She says she's tired of me running in circles
She says it's time that we took a break

Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave
Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave
Cassy O'
Cassy O'
Please don't leave
