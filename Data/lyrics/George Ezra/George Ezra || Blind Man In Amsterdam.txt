
I saw a blind man in Amsterdam with a box around his neck
And the music box kept singing on and the song I won't forget

It went boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boom boom
boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boooodum

Well 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 walk past the man so fast
The audience kept moving on ignoring the cast
I found 50 of his currency and dropped it in his tin
He said "When your adventure ends your next one will begin"
When this adventure ends your next one will begin

With a boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boom boom
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boooodum

You'll find a blind man in Amsterdam with a box around his neck
And the music box keeps singing on and the song you won't forget
The song you won't forget

With a boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boom boom
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boooodum
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boom boom
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boooodum
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boom boom
Boomdidi boomdidi boom boom boom boodum boodum boooodum
