
I may love you in the morning
Like today, you'll never know
Step this way, I find the garden
Like today, you'll never know

Well you may claim that you found me
Like today, you'll never know
Like today, you'll never know

Well nonetheless,
I must confess,
That I'm the mess that has been left to save you

Your situation must be dire
Your situation must be over the creek
Haunted we speak
But I can't of left you, I still haven't met you

Well I may fall into your dance
Like today, I'd never know
We may meet with awkward hearts
Like today, I'd never know
Oh like today, I'd never know

Well nonetheless I must confess, that I'm the mess that
Has been left
Well nonetheless I must confess I'm the mess that
Has been left to save you
My situation must be dire
My situation must be over the creek
And haunted we speak, and I can't of left you
I still haven't met you

If ever said too much
Hear my last spoken words
And if I never said enough
Well bleed my last spoken words
Well bleed my last spoken words

Oh nonetheless I must confess that I'm the mess
That has been left
Well nonetheless I must confess that I'm the mess that
Has been left to save you
Our situations must be dire
Our situation must be over the creek
Haunted we speak, over the creek
Haunted we speak
I can't of left you
I still haven't met you
