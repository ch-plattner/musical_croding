
Come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna start living right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls just wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My daddy yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's what they really want
To have fun, oh
When the working day is done
These girls just want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have

Just wanna 
Just, just wanna
Just wanna
Just, just wanna 
Just wanna 
Just, just wanna
Just wanna
Just, just wanna have

Some boys will find themselves a beautiful girl
And then hide them away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to dance in the sun
And girls just wanna have fun
Oh, Ezra wants to have

Just wanna 
Just, just wanna
Just wanna
Just, just wanna 
Just wanna 
Just, just wanna
Just wanna
Just, just wanna have
[x2]
Fun
