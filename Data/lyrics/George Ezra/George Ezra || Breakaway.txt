He won't tell her what is going on
He won't tell her what is going on
Well try'o try o, lie'o lie o
He won't tell her what is going on

You may think that he's a demolition expert
When he's finished with your self-esteem
It may be true we all need knocking down a few
Come find shelter or your shelter with me, with me

Breakaway

She don't like to disturb the peace
Became attached to the weak at least
She's got, diamonds to show for it
That tree of gold for it

She don't like to disturb the peace
You may think that he's a master of disguise
You lost your dignity you compromised
It may be true we all need knocking down a few
Come find shelter oh your shelter with me, with me

Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh
Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh
Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh,
Breakaway oh, Breakaway oh,

You, you may think that he's a demolition expert
When he's finished with your self-esteem
It may be true we all need knocking down a few
Come find shelter oh your shelter with me, with me

Breakaway, Breakaway
