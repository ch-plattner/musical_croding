
Is it time that you move on
Collect your bags from the doorstep
I'll take them on, I'll take the noise

There's no way back, 'cause your back gone
Is it not clear where it all went wrong
I can't purify, can't make it right

Is she letting you down again
Is she letting you down

We'll drive slower, 'round the corner
Hoping all this will change
I'm your brother, your coat of armour
Hoping all this will change

You worked it down, all long ago
Lay your arms on the doorstep
I feel the tension, I feel the worst

Is she letting you down again
Is she letting you down
Is she letting you down again
Is she letting you down

We'll drive slower, 'round the corner
Hoping all this will change
I'm your brother, your coat of armour
Hoping all this will change

Is she letting you down again
Is she letting you down
Is she letting you down again
Is she letting you down

We'll drive slower, 'round the corner
Hoping all this will change
I'm your brother, your coat of armour
Hoping all this will change

We'll drive slower, 'round the corner
Hoping all this will change
I'm your brother, your coat of armour
Hoping all this will change

I'm your brother, your coat of armour
