We’re just window shopping
Won’t you dance with me?
I’m gonna knock you down
Have you afterhours

Too many sherbet dips
You’ll get licked if you carry on this way
Beautiful punchbag
I’m gonna lay you down
Just call me Mr. Brown

Ohhhhhhh,

I’m not that kind of man in the day,
Won’t you hold me steady, spectacular rival?
And I’ve had medicine
Though you‘re not my friend,
I’ll love you ‘till the end

Either way,
Heaven’s got a place for me
Your majesty,
Why you got it in for me?

Either way,
Heaven’s got a place for me
Your majesty,
Why you got it in for me?

Either way,
Heaven’s got a place for me
Your majesty,
Why you got it in for me?

Either way,
Heaven’s got a place for me
Your majesty,
Why you got it in for me?
