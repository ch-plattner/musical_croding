
Let me tell you about my best friend
Well he's got hair down to his knees
He gets along fine doing just how he please

And I believe that we first met
Around three years ago
Well it feels like a lifetime funny how fast it goes

And I remember how this one time
Well I stole his sister's car
And he didn't even mind no he jumped in for the ride

We'd got miles away from anywhere
When the panic soon kicked in
We'd got it back safe and sound no one asked us where we'd been 

Ohh Oh Oh 
Ohh Oh Oh

Let me tell you why his sister
Why she didn't second guess
She was going out of line, putting on her favorite dress

And oh by God she knows she's worth it
Any boy would tell you so
Well a girl like that is worth her own weight in gold

Ohh Oh Oh 
Ohh Oh Oh

Now I made a promise to myself once
That I would wake up by her side
My best friend said that that would be the day I died

Ohh Oh Oh 
Ohh Oh Oh
