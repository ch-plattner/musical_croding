I feel your head resting heavy on your single bed
I want to hear all about it, get it all off your chest
I feel the tears and you’re not alone
When I hold you well I won’t let go
Why should we care for what they’re selling us anyway
We’re so young girl and you know

You don’t have to be there babe
You don’t have to be scared babe
You don’t need a plan, of what you want to do
Won’t you listen to the man that's loving you

Your world keeps spinning and you can’t jump off
But I will catch you if you fall, I can’t tell you enough
I hate to hear that you’re feeling low
I hate to hear that you won’t come home

Why, should we care for what they’re selling us anyway
We’re, so young girl and you know

You don’t have to be there babe
You don’t have to be scared babe
You don’t need a plan, of what you want to do
Won’t you listen to the man that's loving you

Easy easy and a 1, 2, 3
Breasy breasy if you come with me
Easy easy and a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, na, na, na, na

You don’t have to be there babe
You don’t have to be scared babe
You don’t need a plan, of what you want to do
Won’t you listen to the man that's loving you

You don’t have to be there babe
You don’t have to be scared babe
You don’t need a plan, of what you want to do
Won’t you listen to the man that's loving you
