He reads yesterday's news,
Cause today's just scares him.
Thinks of yesterday's blues,
Cause today's are just far too grim.
And it grows, on it grows.

And I see him down in the morning,
Lying blind without no warning.
Seen him running through the night,
Through the fall lead his enemies inside.
And it grows, on it grows.

And I'm learning how to walk,
Learning how to take my time,
Or the angels take him away and,
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay,
And it grows, on it grows.

And I see him burning to dust,
Seen him falling through the shadows,
Shed a tear and his cheek rusts,
Seen him falling through the shadows,
And it grows, on it grows.

And I'm learning how to walk,
Learning how to turn my back,
Or the angels take him away and,
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay,
And it grows, on it grows.

I'll walk and then I'll walk,
Lord, I'll walk, I'll walk and then I'll walk
Lord, I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk
I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk
Lord, I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk
And I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk, Lord, I'll walk
And it grows, on it grows.

He's as angry as the hills
He's got a mind and eyes and both set to kill, oh
Maybe that he may learn to walk,
And maybe that he may learn to take his time,
Maybe that I may learn to walk,
Maybe that I may learn to turn my back once more...
