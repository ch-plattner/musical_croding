[Luke:]
I don't even like you,
Why'd you want to go and make me feel this way? (What?)
And I don't understand what's happened,
I keep saying things I never say.

[Michael:]
I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen,
I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me.

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, I wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath.

Ooh [2x]

[Calum:]
Won't you please stop loving me to death?

[Luke:]
I don't even see my friends no more,
'Cause I keep hanging out with you.
I don't know how you kept me up all night,
Or how I got this tattoo.

[Michael and Calum:]
I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen,
I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me.

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, I wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath.

Ooh [2x]

[Calum:]
Won't you please stop loving me to death?

[Luke:]
Every time you're near me,
Suddenly my heart begins to race.
Every time I leave,
I don't know why my heart begins to break.

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, I wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath.

Ooh [2x]

[Calum:]
Won't you please stop loving me to death?
