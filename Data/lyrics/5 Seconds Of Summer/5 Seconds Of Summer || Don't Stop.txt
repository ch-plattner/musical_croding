You've got me thinking, that we can run away
You want I'll take you there
You tell me when and where
Ooohh oh oh

But then I, asked for your number
Said you don't have a phone,
It's getting late now
I've gotta let you know that

Everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

Don't stop doing what you're doing
Every time you move to the beat it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
Don't stop, 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it

You come in close now, swear I can taste it,
You've got me tongue tied I can't escape it
I'm loving what you got
But then you push me off
Ooohh oh oh oh

And everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

Don't stop doing what you're doing
Every time you move to the beat it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
Don't stop, 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it

Every day it's the same
All the games that you play
Back and forth round and round
Kinda like it this way

Don't stop doing what you're doing
'Cause every time you move to the beat it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
Don't stop, 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it, know it

Don't stop doing what you're doing
Every time you move to the beat it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
Don't stop, 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it
