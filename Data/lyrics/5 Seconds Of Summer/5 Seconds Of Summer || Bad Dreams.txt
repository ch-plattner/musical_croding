
You look so beautiful
No one but me knows you're insane
I feel so damn pathetic
My friends just don't get it

Cause you've got me under oath
Before you I was in a fucking rut
One day you're in the past
That night I ask you back

It started out just harmless fun
Now you've got me thinking you're the one

Cause if you wanna take me home
You know I'm ready to leave
You've got me under your spell
Please don't set me free

Cause I've been having all these nightmares
Seeing you is my only way up
Feeling so defenseless
But I'm telling you
I wouldn't change a thing

You've got me feeling strange
Cause I love to hate you so damn much
But I can't think of leaving
Cause you're what keeps me breathing

It started out just harmless fun
Now you've got me thinking you're the one

Cause if you wanna take me home
You know I'm ready to leave
You've got me under your spell
Please don't set me free

Cause I've been having all these nightmares
Seeing you is my only way up
Feeling so defenseless
But I'm telling you
I wouldn't change a thing

Cause if you wanna take me home
You know I'm ready to leave
You've got me under your spell
Please don't set me free

Cause if you wanna take me home
You know I'm ready to leave
You've got me under your spell
Please don't set me free

Cause I've been having all these nightmares
Seeing you is my only way up
Feeling so defenseless
But I'm telling you
I wouldn't change a thing
