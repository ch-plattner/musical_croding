You're telling me the same old story
And that I need to change
If you're not living my life for me
You make it feel that way

You know you know
We're losing control
I gotta break away
And nothing's gonna change

You've got to go
It's the end of the road
No matter what you do or say
Baby, you're not what I need

I'm over this
I'm over you
I'm not gonna waste my life away
This is my independence day
I'm moving on
There's no excuse
And I can't take away your pain
This is my independence day [2x]

Suddenly my picture's looking perfect
Since you're not in the frame
And deep down I never meant to hurt you
But you're the one to blame

You know you know
We're losing control
Before it's too late
I'm making my escape

Now that I'm gone
You're on your own
No matter what you do or say
Baby, you're not what I need

I'm over this
I'm over you
I'm not gonna waste my life away
This is my independence day
I'm moving on
There's no excuse
And I can't take away your pain
This is my independence day

Wouldn't it be nice
If it could've worked out right for us?
I know you fought for all we had

But it didn't feel right
Heart's on our sleeves, we lost tonight
And there's no looking back

I'm over this
I'm over you
I'm not gonna waste my life away
This is my independence day
I'm moving on
There's no excuse
And I can't take away your pain
This is my independence day

Wouldn't it be nice
If it would've worked out right for us?
There's no looking back

This is my independence day [2x]
