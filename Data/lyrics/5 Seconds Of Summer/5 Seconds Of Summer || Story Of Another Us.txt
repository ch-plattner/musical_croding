Inside my head
I don't recall a single word, you hit me faster than I heard
Inside my head

And now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I always wondered where you'd been
Tell me if you wanted it at all

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart to just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch and new beginnings
So take this heart, put yourself in it
The surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

Memories are pay-per-view, it costs too much to think of you
I'm hanging by a thread
And epilogue before we're done, I see quick to what we've begun
I'm hanging by a thread

And now before our hope is lost
My heart is here, it's such a cause
Tell me if you wanted it at all

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart to just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last stitch and new beginnings
So take this heart, put yourself in it
The surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

Trap me, beside you
Where I'll be to remind you
We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts

One last stitch and new beginnings
So take this heart, put yourself in it
The surprise ending I'm depending on

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart to just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last stitch and new beginnings
So take this heart, put yourself in it
The surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us
