Take a left at the exit please,
He's gotta get out of this body.
His lungs collapse on the side of his guitar,
Regrets with nothing left so far.
'Cause he knows when or not to play himself.

He wears the perfect disguise
That keeps them on their feet.
Tryna' play Prince Charming,
When he's dying within.
Tells himself he gotta be real,
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene.
He's asking the question
Whether he's messing around or he's serious.

Take a right over here,
Please and thank you.
'Cause he gotta get his head outta the sky.
And a decision to lie,
To keep him fine.
'Cause he knows when or not to play himself.

He wears the perfect disguise
That keeps them on their feet.
Tryna' play Prince Charming,
When he's dying within.
Tells himself he gotta be real,
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene.
He's asking the question
Whether he's messing around or he's serious.

Time can't buy
What we're looking for.
It's like an island,
Oppressed and we're poor.
If this turns out the way
It's supposed to go,
It feels so right,
When everything's so blind in the lights.

He wears the perfect disguise
That keeps them on their feet.
Tryna' play Prince Charming,
When he's dying within.
Tells himself he gotta be real,
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene.
He's asking the question
Whether he's messing around or he's serious. [2x]
