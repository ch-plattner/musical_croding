What's your name, what's your number?
I got the keys to my dad's yellow Hummer.
There's a party, you can come if you wanna go
Tonight
Alright, see you later

Wrapped up late
Took a minute but I found my mates
She was there, acting cool
So we made her wait
Wasn't long couple songs 'til I headed her way
To say
Damn!
You look amazing

Last night, what a blur
Woke up lying next to her
Last night, made a mess
Doesn't get better than this
Phone rings from the bar
25 texts and a call from mom
It must've been good 'cause I can't remember!

Retraced my steps
Searched my phone
Tryna figure out who posted pictures of me streaking past the neighbour's house
If my boss sees my status, he'll be freaking out
But I don't care
Oh, well
Deal with it later

Last night, what a blur
Woke up lying next to her
Last night, made a mess
Doesn't get better than this
Phone rings from the bar
25 texts and a call from mom
It must've been good 'cause I can't remember!

"Bro, where's your shirt?"
"Ah, shit!"
"What the hell happened last night?"
"I've got the biggest headache"
"I need an aspirin, my head's killing me"
"Who was that girl from last night anyway?"

Pretty girl,
I've got your name, got your number
I lost the keys to my dad's yellow Hummer
Can't remember how I did it, but I got her
Now she's mine
Damn, she's so amazing

Last night, what a blur
Woke up lying next to her
Last night, made a mess
Doesn't get better than this
Phone rings from the bar
25 texts and a call from mom
It must've been good 'cause I can't remember!

Last night, what a blur

Can't remember [9x]

It must've been good 'cause I can't remember
