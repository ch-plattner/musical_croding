When I saw your face I knew
I'd do anything to try to get to you
I don't even know your name
You got me frozen in place and I can't move

Your lips are like dynamite
(Your lips are like dynamite)
Your eyes had me alive
(Shining light)
I refused to hold you close
I've been wrong

You're all I need so shout it out
I fall to my knees when you're around
Time stands still
And you don't even try
I've got to have you in my life

(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me 
(Oh-oh)
I've got you on my mind 
(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me 
(Oh-oh)
Run away with me tonight
(Tonight)

You've got the keys to make me start
Don't have my license 
Let's make out in your dad's car
I tried to make him laugh
You looked my way but you just smiled
Then walked right by

Your lips are like dynamite
(Your lips are like dynamite)
Your eyes had me alive
(Shining light)
I refused to hold you close
I've been wrong

You're all I need so shout it out
I fall to my knees when you're around
Time stands still
And you don't even try
I've got to have you in my life

(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me
(Oh-oh)
I've got you on my mind
(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me
(Oh-oh)
Run away with me tonight
(Tonight)

There she goes again
Telling me to run away
It's time to take a chance
So I'll scream my lungs out
She said soon we'll run away
Heart starts beating
She says we'll find a plan
She says

You're all I need so shout it out
I fall to my knees when you're around
Time stands still
And you don't even try
I've got to have you in my life

(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me
(Oh-oh)
I've got you on my mind
(Oh-oh)
Tell me that you need me
(Oh-oh)
Run away with me tonight
(Tonight)
