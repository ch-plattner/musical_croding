She sits at home with the lights out
Seeing life in different colours
I think it’s time that we wake up
So let me take you away

We can run down the street
With the stars in our eyes
We can tear down this town
In the dark of the night
Just open the door
We’ve got time on our side
We can make it out alive

Hey we’re taking on the world
I’ll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Let’s be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

It took so long to convince you
I knew I had to show my colours
You never wanted to be rescued
But now we’re drifting away

We can run down the street
With the stars in our eyes
We can tear down this town
In the dark of the night
Just open the door
We’ve got time on our side
We can make it out alive

Hey we’re taking on the world
I’ll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Let’s be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

Earthquakes won’t wait for another day
Don’t say I know I never said it
I never said it, oh
One day we can make it out alive

Hey we’re taking on the world
I’ll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Let’s be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

So let go!
Till’ we've lost control
And we’ll stumble through it all
Let’s do something new and unpredictable
