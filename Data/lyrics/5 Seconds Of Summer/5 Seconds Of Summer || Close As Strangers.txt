
Six weeks since I've been away
And now you're sayin' everything has changed
And I'm afraid that I might be losing you
And every night that we spend alone
It kills me thinking of you on your own
And I wish I was back home next to you

Oh, everyday
You feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up
Even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Late night calls and another text
Is this as good as we're gonna get?
Another timezone taking me away from you
Living dreams in fluorescent lights
While you and I are running out of time
But you know that I'll always wait for you

Oh, everyday
You feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up
Even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

On the phone
I can tell that you wanna move on
Through the tears
I can hear that I shouldn't have gone
Every day gets harder to stay away from you
So tell me...

Are we wasting time
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers

Wasting time
Talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up
Even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Six months since I went away
And I know everything has changed
But tomorrow I'll be coming back to you
