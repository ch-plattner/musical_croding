
Even when the sky is falling down
Even when the earth is crumbling 'round my feet

Even when we try to say goodbye
And you can cut the tension with a knife in here

'Cause I know what'll happen
If we get through this

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out

'Cause I feel so damn lost
And it comes with a cost of being alone

Everything is falling down
We're suffering, helpless thoughts and
Out we sing, prayers go to the sky

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out
Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out

And if we fall
It's not your fault
Shadows covering
Our selfish foes
And as our love,
Can go out on a high note

Even when the sky is falling down
Even when the earth is crumbling 'round my feet
Around my feet

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out
Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out

We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out

We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out
