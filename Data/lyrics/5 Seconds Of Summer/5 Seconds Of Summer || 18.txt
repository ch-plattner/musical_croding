
Oooh
Oooh

[Luke:]
I wish that I was eighteen, do
All the things
You read in a magazine
I'm not saying I wanna be Charlie Sheen

[Calum:]
She's just a little bit older
But I want to get to know her
She said it's already over

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

[All:]
She told me to meet her there
I can't afford a bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

Oooh

[Calum:]
I think she wants to get with me
But she's got a job in the city
Says that she's always too busy

[Michael:]
She's got a naughty tattoo, in
Place that I want to get to,
But my mom still drives me to school

[Calum and Luke:]
So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

[All:]
She told me to meet her there
I can't afford a bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

You got me waiting in a queue
For a bar I can't get into
I'm not old enough for you
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

[Luke:]
In my bedroom thinking of ya
Her pictures in my private folder
I know one day that I will hold her
I'll make my move when I get older
Make my move when I get older

[All:]
She told me to meet her there
I can't afford a bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

You got me waiting in a queue
For a bar I can't get into
I'm not old enough for you
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

[Luke:]
I'm so sick of waiting 'til I'm eighteen
