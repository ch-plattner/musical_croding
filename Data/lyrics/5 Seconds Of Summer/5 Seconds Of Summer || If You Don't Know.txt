Tonight we're fading fast
I just wanna make this last
If I could say the things that I wanna say
I'd find a way to make you stay
I'd never let you get away
Catch you in all the games we've played

So go ahead, rip my heart out
Show me what love's all about
Go ahead, rip my heart out
That's what love's all about

I want you to want me this way
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know
Let me go (oh oh oh way oh) [x3]
Let me go (oh oh)
If you don't know, then just let me go

Let's forget the past
I swear we'll make this last
'Cause I remember the taste of your skin tonight
And the way that you looked, you had those eyes
I remember the way it felt inside
And the names of the songs that made you cry
You would scream, we would fight, you would call me crazy
I would laugh, you were mad, but you always kissed me
And the shirt that I had, that you always borrowed
When I woke, it was gone, there was no tomorrow

I want you to want me this way
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know
Let me go (oh oh oh way oh) [x3]
Let me go (oh oh)
If you don't know, then just let me go

Go ahead rip my heart out, if you think that's what love's all about
Go ahead rip my heart out, go ahead rip my heart out
[x2]

I want you to want me this way
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know
Let me go (oh oh oh way oh) [x3]
Let me go (oh oh)
If you don't know, then just let me go
