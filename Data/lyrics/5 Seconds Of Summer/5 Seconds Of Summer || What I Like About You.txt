Hey! Hey!

[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
Wanna come over tonight?
Yeah

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

[Calum:]
What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance, yeah

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
Hey!

[Ashton:]
What I like about you
You keep me warm at night ["You hold me real tight" at live version]

[Ashton & Calum:]
Never wanna let you go
Know you make me feel alright

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you

That's what I like about you, you
That's what I like about you
