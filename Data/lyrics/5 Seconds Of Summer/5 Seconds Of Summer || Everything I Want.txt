
They can say what they say
I just want you to believe
But these clouds are still dark
I have loved you from the start

But you're so beautiful
And you're incredible
Irreplaceable
I never wanna lose my baby

[Chorus:]
But you are everything I want
And everything I need
It's all because of you
I can barely breathe
When we wake up in the morning,
It's a brighter day
We sail the high seas
Cause baby you and me,
We can always be
I just wanna call you mine

I get down on one knee
Baby please please take me
Whisper in reply
With a tear in your eye

But you're so beautiful
And you're incredible
Irreplaceable
I never wanna lose my baby

[Chorus:]
But you are everything I want
And everything I need
It's all because of you
I can barely breathe
When we wake up in the morning,
It's a brighter day
We sail the high seas
Cause baby you and me,
We can always be

Take take take me all the way
There's nothing left to say
Now I feel remorse
Take take take my breath away
There's nothing left to feel
Than the pain you gave to me

But you are everything I want
And everything I need
It's all because of you

[Chorus:]
But you are everything I want
And everything I need
It's all because of you
I can barely breathe
When we wake up in the morning,
It's a brighter day
We sail the high seas
Cause baby you and me,
We can always be
I just wanna call you mine
