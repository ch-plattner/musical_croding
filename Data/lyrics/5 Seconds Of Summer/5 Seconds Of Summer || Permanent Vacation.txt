[Michael:]
You say that I'm too complicated
Hung up and mis-educated
I say 9 to 5 is overrated
And we all fall down

[Michael:]
I can't sleep 'cause my mind keeps racing
My chest hurts 'cause my heart keeps breaking
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking
And we all fall down

[Luke:]
Frustration, desperation
You say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

[All:]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes
Destination: permanent vacation

[Michael:]
Na-na, na-na na na

[Michael and Calum:]
Voices coming through the speaker
They can't make me a believer
I know I'm an under-achiever
And we're all so proud

[Calum:]
Watch out, I think we're going under
Right now, you're just another number
Get out, the system's in the gutter
And we're all so proud

[Luke:]
Frustration, desperation
You say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

[All:]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes
Destination: permanent vacation

[All:]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes
Destination: permanent vacation

[All:]
Na-na, na-na na na na na
Na-na, na-na na na na na

[Michael:]
Congratulations, your imitations
Are taking over the radio stations
Corporations, calculations
We're the voice of the new generation
