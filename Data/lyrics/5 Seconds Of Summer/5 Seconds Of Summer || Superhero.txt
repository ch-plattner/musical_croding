Eddie never went nowhere
He stayed at home and played his X-Box
He read too many comics
He watched too much TV
Then somehow it got around
That his parents would be out of town
And so they all decided
That he should have a party

Climbing through the windows
They were jumping off the roof
They were diving in the pool
Until he finally let loose

He said tonight I'm a superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again
(No no no)
Tonight I'm a superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again

He had never got any
But this is the night his luck would change
She wore those thick black glasses
But she was so sexy
People started throwin' bottles
Partied 'til they trashed the whole house
But he just didn't care though
Cause he was finally happy

She met him on the staircase
Clark Kent and Lois Lane
They started making out
and it would never be the same

He said tonight I'm a superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again
(No no no)
Tonight I'm a superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again

Neighbors came at midnight screaming,
"Turn that music down!"
They said, "Where the hell is Eddie?"
He was nowhere to be found

He said tonight I'm a superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again

He said tonight I'm a superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again
(No no no)
Tonight I'm a superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again
