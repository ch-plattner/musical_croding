
You throw me around like your rag doll
And throw me away like your cigarettes
And pick up the pieces of whatever's left of me,
They're yours to keep
A million and one ways that I've tried
To turn it around, leave it all behind
But every time you turn out to be
One step ahead of me

Lost in reality
I can feel you in the dark when I fall asleep
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?
Bittersweet chemistry
I can't escape you anywhere, even in my dreams
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?

Under all the lights in the night sky
You drift away, then you disappear
Counting the days 'til I bring you back
To me, eventually
And my strung-out heart needs your angel eyes
Then tear me apart and I'm hypnotised
Let's pick up the pieces of whatever's left of me,
They're yours to keep

Lost in reality
I can feel you in the dark when I fall asleep
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?
Bittersweet chemistry
I can't escape you anywhere, even in my dreams
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?

Lost in reality
I can feel you in the dark when I fall asleep
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?

Lost in reality
I can feel you in the dark when I fall asleep
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?
Bittersweet chemistry
I can't escape you anywhere, even in my dreams
All that's in my head are pictures of memories,
Words that you said to me
Hey hey Hailey, won't you save me?
