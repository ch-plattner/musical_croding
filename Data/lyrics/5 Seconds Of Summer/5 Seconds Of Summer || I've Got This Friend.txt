Can I have a minute?
I've gotta tell you something.
I heard that someone likes you,
And it might be nothing but he's right in front of you.

He's kinda my size,
Don't look back 'cause he's looking.
I think you know him,
But you just don't know that he's right in front of you.

Baby, you've been talking to him nearly every day,
He really likes all the games that you play.
He told me to tell you to see what you'd say,
Before he jumps in and he asks for a date.

'Cause I've got this friend who's crazy about you,
I've got this friend who can't be without you,
I've got this friend and I wish I could see,
How this would end if you knew it was me.

Something I have to tell you,
He plays the bass guitar.
He thinks you'd like him better
If he had a car but now he's right in front of you.

Baby, you've been talking to him nearly every day,
He really likes all the games that you play.
He told me to tell you to see what you'd say,
Before he jumps in and he asks for that date.

'Cause I've got this friend who's crazy about you,
I've got this friend who can't be without you,
I've got this friend and I wish I could see,
See what you'd say if I told you it was me.

Talking to you nearly every day,
And I really like all the games that you play,
So I want to tell you to see what you'd say,
Before I jump in and I ask for that date.

I've been that friend,
I've been that friend.

I've been that friend and I wish I could see,
How this would end if you knew it was me.

Talking to you nearly every day,
I really like all the games that you play,
I wanna tell you to see what you say,
Before I jump in and I ask for that date.

'Cause I've been that friend who's crazy about you,
I've been that friend who can't live without you,
I've been that friend who wants to be with you,
I've been that friend who wants to be near you.
'Cause I've been that friend and I wish I could see,
How this would end if you knew it was me.
