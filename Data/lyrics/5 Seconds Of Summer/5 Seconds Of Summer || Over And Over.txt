
You know something I don't
It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over
You say things that I don't
You make me feel alone
Every night replayed over and over

You say it's no concern
And everything's alright
Sometimes we all get burnt
And then we try to hide
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know we're wrong
We should have let things slide

And when the night gets dark
And there's no way back
I'll call your name 
But it's fading, we're fading

You know something I don't
It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over
You say things that I don't
You make me feel alone
Every night replayed over and over

So many times you say
You're staying out tonight
I wish that I could just walk away
But I won't leave you behind

Cause when the night gets dark
And there's no way back
I'll call your name 
But it's fading, we're fading

You know something I don't
It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over
You say things that I don't
You make me feel alone
Every night replayed over and over

Well I won't be back no more
Just like I did before
Always thinkin that it's gonna be alright
I'm gonna start again 
This time I won't pretend
That you're coming back into my life

You know something I don't
It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over

You know something I don't
It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over
You say things that I don't
You make me feel alone
Every night replayed over and over
