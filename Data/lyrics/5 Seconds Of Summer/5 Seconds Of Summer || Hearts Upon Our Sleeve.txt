[Guy Mowbray:]
Incredible scenes at BBC Radio 1,
As Scott Mills and 5 Seconds of Summer have made a football song.
It's 5 Seconds of Summer and Scott Mills: 1.
Everyone else: nil.

[All:]
Oh, oh, oh, o-oh [x3]

[Luke:]
(We wear our hearts upon our sleeve.)

[Luke:]
There's a part of my heart that you'll never change.

[Michael:]
There's a dream so alive, it's an endless flame.

[Calum:]
And you can't keep us down, 'cause we'll always come back again.
(Always come back again.)

[Luke:]
For the highs and the lows, for the rise and falls.

[Michael:]
And the times that you thought you gave it your all.

[Luke:]
For the night and a dream and those moments you'll never get back again.
(Never get back again.)

[Michael:]
'Cause the world is at our feet.

[All:]
We've been through a thousand heartbreaks, but you know we still believe.
We wear the same shirts as our fathers, and our hearts upon our sleeve.
Don't stop us now, we've started. 'Cause there's no one we can't beat.
We wear the same shirts as our fathers, and our hearts upon our sleeve.

Oh, oh, oh, o-oh [x3]

[Luke:]
(We wear our hearts upon our sleeve.)

[Calum:]
Hear the crowd in the stands, and out in the streets.

[Michael:]
Every fan everywhere on the edge of their seats.

[Calum:]
It's a beautiful day for a beautiful game.
(Beautiful game.)

See the players run out, and the anthems ring.

[Michael:]
And you're singing so hard, you can't hear a thing.

[Calum:]
But the beat of your heart (beat of your heart) is beating you up again.
(Beating you up again.)

[Michael:]
'Cause the world is at our feet!

[All:]
We've been through a thousand heartbreaks, but you know we still believe.
We wear the same shirts as our fathers, and our hearts upon our sleeve.
Don't stop us now, we've started. 'Cause there's no one we can't beat.
We wear the same shirts as our fathers, and our hearts upon our sleeve.

Oh, oh, oh, o-oh [x3]

[Luke:]
(We wear our hearts upon our sleeve.)

[Scott Mills:]
5 Seconds of Summer, 'til the end of the game.
The joy, the heartache, the tension, the pain.
A striker shoots, there's a roar from the crowd.
They think it's all over, it is now.

[All:]
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, bah bah. [x4]

It's a generic football anthem, to be sung around the world.
And we hope it doesn't sound like any others that you've heard.
Don't stop us now, we've started. 'Cause there's no one we can't beat.
We wear the same shirts as our fathers, and our hearts upon our sleeve.

Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, bah bah. [x3]
Ba-da-da.

[Luke:]
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve.
