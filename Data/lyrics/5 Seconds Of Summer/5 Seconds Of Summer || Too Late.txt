
Ever since the day that we met
I couldn't get you out of my head
There was always something about you
Every chance that I seem to get
Finds a way to end in regret
There was always something about you

Jealousy keeps containing me
In time you'll see
Just what we could be

[Chorus:]
But I'm always too late
I'm always too late
I see you but I always hesitate
'Cause I'm always too late
Don't wanna be too late
To have you by my side and I can't wait
'Cause never is too late

Every time I see you with him
I'm tearing down the walls in my head
I can't hold back any longer

Jealousy keeps containing me
In time you'll see
Just what we could be

[Chorus:]
But I'm always too late
I'm always too late
I see you but I always hesitate
'Cause I'm always too late
Don't wanna be too late
To have you by my side and I can't wait
'Cause never is too late

Wanted to tell you
What I feel inside
Don't wanna hurt you
I'll make you feel alright

Wanted to tell you
What I feel inside
Don't wanna hurt you
I'll make you feel alright

[Chorus:]
But I'm always too late
I'm always too late
I see you but I always hesitate
'Cause I'm always too late
Don't wanna be too late
To have you by my side and I can't wait

'Cause I'm always too late
(I'm always too late)
I'm always too late
(Waiting for you babe)
I see you but I always hesitate
'Cause I'm always too late
(I'm always too late)
Don't wanna be too late
(Waiting for you babe)
To see you by my side and I can't wait
'Cause never is too late
