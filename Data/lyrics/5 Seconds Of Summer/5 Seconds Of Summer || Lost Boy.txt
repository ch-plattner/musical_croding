
I can't remember the last time I saw your face
I feel so lonely when I'm in a crowded space
You left me without direction

'Cause I've been from place to place
Trying to bring you back
I've walked for days and days
'Cause I can't face the fact
That nothing is better than you

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy.

I can't remember the last time I heard your voice
I'm sat in silence living in a world of noise
'Cause you were perfection

'Cause I've been from place to place
Trying to bring you back
I've walked for days and days
'Cause I can't face the fact
That nothing is better than you

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy

Come find me [x16]

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

Without you I'm a lost boy
