You got a boyfriend,
And he's a total loser,
All your friends tell you that he's got no future,
But they like me,
Just saying

He barely takes you out,
If he does he's late,
And when the check comes he always makes you pay,
I'd never do that,
Just saying

You should leave him,
'Cause it really makes me sick,
Just saying, just saying
You don't need him,
I'll help you get over it,
Just saying, just saying

When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
'Cause I'm better than him,
Just saying
When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
Just saying

Got a big house,
He says he lives alone,
But when I drove by I could see his mom was home,
I got my own place, (he told me lies to you)
Just saying

He says he loves you,
But it's all an act,
He's seeing someone else right behind your back,
You know I'd never do that, (he would never do that)
Just saying

You should leave him,
'Cause it really makes me sick,
Just saying, just saying,
You don't need him,
I'll help you get over it,
Just saying, just saying,

When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
'Cause I'm better than him,
Just saying
When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
Just saying, just saying

[Instrumental]

You should leave him,
'Cause it really makes me sick,
Just saying, just saying
You don't need him,
I'll help you get over it,
Just saying, just saying

When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
'Cause I'm better than him,
Just saying
When you change your mind I'll be waiting,
Just saying, just saying
