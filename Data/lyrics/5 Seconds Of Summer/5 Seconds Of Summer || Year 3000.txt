I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was
One of them rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbour called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen

He said
"I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they live under water
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is pretty fine (pretty fine)"

He took me to the future in the Flux thing and I saw everything
Boy bands and another one and another one... and another one
Triple breasted women swim around town... totally naked

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in the film I've seen

He said
"I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they live under water
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is pretty fine (is pretty fine)"

I took a trip to the year three thousand
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our 7th album

He said,
"I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they live under water
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is pretty fine (she's pretty fine)"
He said,
"I've been to the year three thousand.
Not much has changed but they live under water
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is pretty fine (is pretty fine)" 

He said "I've been to the year three thousand"
