
Oh say, can you see? This is not who I'm supposed to be
Without you I'm nobody, killing time
I try to deceive, try to win you desperately
Now I'm lost in the swirling sea of your sorry eyes

All my life, I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire, and wash over you like the sun
I will fight, to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world, but maybe I'll change your mind

Oh say, do you know? I'm a fool in a one man show
I'm a broken stereo, out of time
So how does it feel? All alone, is it so surreal?
Because the ghost of survivors guilt can be so unkind

All my life, I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire, and wash over you like the sun
I will fight, to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world, but maybe I'll change your mind

The words you speak, surrounding me
This is broken love, in the first degree
The air you breathe is haunting me
Maybe I'll change your mind

All my life, I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire, and wash over you like the sun
I will fight, to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world
I know that I can't change the world
But maybe I'll change your mind
