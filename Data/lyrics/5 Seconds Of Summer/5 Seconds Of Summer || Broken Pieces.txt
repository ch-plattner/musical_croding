
I woke up in the place we started
Your clothes on the floor in that old apartment
I never thought you'd leave without a trace
I can't shake this sinking feeling
I know you're not there and I'm barely breathing
Holding onto things I can't replace

I'm looking for a way to change my mind
Don't walk away

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
It's turning to an all out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces
And let go
I'm tryna find a way back home
If it takes until I'm skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces
And let go

Our last words ringing in my head
I wish we'd take back all the things we said
I'm tryna find a way to yesterday
Turning in circles and chasing our tails
And wondering why we created this wasteland
I wish you wouldn't be so cavalier

I'm looking for a way to change my mind
Don't walk away

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
It's turning to an all out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces
And let go
I'm tryna find a way back home
If it takes until I'm skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
Let go, let go
Fix these broken pieces and let go

We're fading out, we're all alone
It's what you wanted, I suppose
I can tell you feel the same
When you say you're looking for a way to change your mind, don't walk away

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
It's turning to an all out war
We'll find a way to fix these broken pieces

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
It's turning to an all out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
I'm tryna find a way back home
If it takes until I'm skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
Let go, let go
Fix these broken pieces and let go
