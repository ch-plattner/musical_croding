[Michael:]
It started on a weekend in May,
I was looking for attention
Needed intervention
Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complexion
Feeling the connection

[Calum & Michael:]
The way she looked was so ridiculous
Every single step had me waiting for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me out the bar to the backseat of a car

[Calum:]
When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget my English love affair
Today,
I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
My English love affair

[Luke:]
Next thing we were back at her place
A hideaway in Mayfair
All the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princess getting naked
Falling on their faces

[Calum & Luke:]
The storyline was so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there

[Calum:]
When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget my English love affair
Today,
I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair

[Chorus x2:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Ashton:]
When I got out I knew
That nobody I knew would be believing me
I look back now and know
That nobody could ever take the memory

[Calum:]
When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget my English love affair
Today,
I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair

[Chorus x2:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My English love affair
