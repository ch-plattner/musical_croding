Ooooh, New York! 

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes 
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean 
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say 
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway 

Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams 
Baby I'm from New York! 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of 
There's nothing you can't do 
Now you're in New York! 
These streets will make you feel brand new 
Big lights will inspire you 
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork! 

On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard 
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God 
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge 
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger for more than an empty fridge 

I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams 
Baby I'm from New York! 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of 
There's nothing you can't do 
Now you're in New York! 
These streets will make you feel brand new 
Big lights will inspire you 
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork! 

One hand in the air for the big city 
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty 
No place in the world that can compare 
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 

In New York! 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of 
There's nothing you can't do 
Now you're in New York! 
These streets will make you feel brand new 
Big lights will inspire you 
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
