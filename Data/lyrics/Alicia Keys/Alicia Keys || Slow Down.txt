Oooooo Baby
There's something that I gotta tell ya
I think that you should know what's on my mind
Ooo baby I'm feelin our situation 
Is getting stronger how we want it
But I gotta take my time
There is so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it,
But before we go too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time
Slow down baby, if you don't mind
Slow down baby, before we make this move
Slow down baby, baby slow down
Cause b4 we make this move
I think it's really 2 soon
Oooo baby it's like I'm knowing you forever
My medulla oblongata electrified
Oooo baby whenever we're alone 2gether
Bout to explode and it feels so right
But I gotta take my time.
There is so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it,
But before we go too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time
Slow down baby, if you don't mind
Slow down baby, before we make this move
Slow down baby, baby slow down
Cause b4 we make this move
Baby it's really 2 soon
Soon, yeah....
See I know what is best, cause I've been there before
Gave myself to someone for all the wrong reasons
But this time around, I don't want to do that again
I just want to make this the way that I've dreamed of
So baby you gotta...

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time
Slow down baby, if you don't mind
Slow down baby, before we make this move
Slow down baby, baby slow down
Cause b4 we make this move
I think it's really 2 soon
Slow down 
You gotta slow down
You gotta slow down
Baby slow down
You gotta slow down
You gotta slow down
You gotta slow down [and out]
