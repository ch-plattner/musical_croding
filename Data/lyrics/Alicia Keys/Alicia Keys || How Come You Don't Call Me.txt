
But all I wanna know is baby 
If what we had was good... 

I keep your picture beside my bed (mmm) 
And I still remember everything you said (mmm) 
I always thought our love was so right I guess I was wrong 
Always thought you'd be by my side papa now you're gone 
(And I'm not tryin' hear that sh*t) 

What I wanna know baby 
If what we had was good 
How come you don't call me anymore 

Still light the fire on a rainy night 
Still like it better when your holding me tight 
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part (mmm) 
Tell me baby baby baby why 
Why you wanna go and break my heart 

All I wanna know is baby 
If what we had was good 
How come you don't call me anymore 

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die 
If you don't call me Papa 
Oh you gotta try 

I'll get down on my knees 
Hoping you please please please 
Oooh won't you call me sometime Papa 

Why on earth 
Can't you just pick up the phone 
You know I don't like to be alone 

How come you don't call me 
(why must you torture me) 
How come you don't call me
