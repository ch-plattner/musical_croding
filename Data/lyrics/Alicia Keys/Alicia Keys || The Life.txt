
Every day I realize that this might
Be the last day of my life
Walking down the streets I find
I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind

Cause when it rains it pours
Isn't life worth more?
I don't even know what I'm hustling for
You gotta do what you gotta do
Just to make it through
All the hard times that's gonna face you

This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life

Living will always be a struggle
Looking for someone true to love you
Looking back, I see all the horrors
This madness makes me wanna hide

I watch slowly, internally, I'm dying
Pillowcase is wet from all my crying
Cause there is nothing more to be here for
Take me away I can't live that life no more

This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life
Striving to survive

This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life
Striving to survive

Trying to get over
Trying to get over
I am just trying, trying to get over
Trying to get over
Trying to get over
Trying to get over
Going to get over
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
