[Verse 1]
We're at the crossroads my dear
Where do we go from here
Maybe you wont go maybe you'll stay
I know I'm going to miss you either way
Its such a lonely road

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here (We go) (All I Can Do Is)
Follow the tracks of my tears (Follow The Tracks) (Tears)

[Verse 2]
When I cry your name
Am I calling in vain?
Am I waitin' only to drown in pain?
Don't you do it no don't you leave me this way
I don't know if I could lift my head and face another day
It's such a lonely road

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here (We go) (All I Can Do Is)
Follow the tracks of my tears (Follow The Tracks) (Tears)

[Bridge]
Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be staring at me
When I'm looking in the mirror trying find the resolution
Were to far gone to find our way home

Where do we go from here (We go) (All I Can Do Is)
Follow the tracks of my tears (Follow The Tracks of my tears)

Where do we go from here (Maybe you will go maybe you'll stay) (All I Can Do Is)
Follow the tracks of my tears (Follow) (Either Way)

[x2]
Oh oh oh
