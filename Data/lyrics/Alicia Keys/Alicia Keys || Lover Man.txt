
First scene opened with the
Vision of a woman in a chair
Up in a bedroom
What she doing there
She is thinkin of a man
And the man just could be you
Write him in a script on a
Business trip out of town far
But he wishes he was near
Does she really want him gotta
Have him burning desire all she
Wanna say is listen my dear...

Gotta tell ya,
I can't wait to see you, see, I need my lover man
Don't you worry about it baby I don't need no other man
We could be the dream that we always dreamed darling
Let's turn up the heat until the water boils over
I can't wait to see you, see, I need my lover man

Second scene it opens with
A woman at the desk of a
Job looking at a timepiece
(Oh yeah)
Cause there is a fight coming
In the night carrying the man
That she's dying to see
(Oh yeah)
He's gettin attacked in the
Second act by a lady
That's been missin him bad
She's all in the scene gotta
Have him really need him he's
The kind of lover she never had

Gotta tell him,
I can't wait to see you, see, I need my lover man
Don't you worry about it baby I don't need no other man
We could be the dream that we always dreamed darling
Let's turn up the heat until the water boils over
I can't wait to see you, see, I need my lover man
