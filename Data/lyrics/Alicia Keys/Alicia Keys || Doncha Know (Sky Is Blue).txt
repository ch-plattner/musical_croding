
If you think the sky is falling
Coming undone
All the pieces crumble
You're on the run
All of the room you've taken
All the rules you're breaking
Don't you know the silent truth is
It comes back to you

Doncha know the sky is blue
Can't you see the sun in breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Everytime you walk out that door
Cursing the sky
Feeling like you've been cheated
Ripped from inside

Doncha know the sky is blue
Cant you see the sun in breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Come on
Mmm
Mmm, yea.

Na nanana na
Na na nananana na nanana

Doncha know the sky is blue
Can't you see the sun in breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Doncha know the sky is blue
Hey!
Doncha know the sky is blue
Come on!
The sky is blue
Say it!
The sky, 
Sky
I'm telling you
The sky is blue
Baby
Whoo-hoo!
Doncha know the sky
Sky 
Sky
Sky-haa!
Hey! 
Hey! 

Na nanana na
Na na nananana na nanana
