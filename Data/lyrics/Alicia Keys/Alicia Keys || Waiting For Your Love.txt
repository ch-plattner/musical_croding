There's no other way 
That I would want someone to hold me, show me like you 
Falling in a daze 
So many ways, I 'm in amazement 
Thinking about you No one took the time 
To hold my mind, and be the kind 
That I could talk to 
This is the type of day 
That I must say, I've been looking forward to 

Look at me shedding no tears 
No worries followed by fear 
So good that soon you'll be here 
They just don't know How good it feels 

Feels so good to not be searching 
Searching just to find that someone 
Feels so good to not be searching 
Knowing that I found that right one 

I'm waiting for your love 
Waiting for your love 
I'm waiting for your love 
Waiting for your love 

Talking on the phone 
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone 
And tempted to touch you 
Nothing ever fades 
The way you take time for me 
It makes me want you 
Call it what you want 
It may be wrong, but baby I'm your fool 
I can verify, that you're my type 
The things we try that others just wont do 

Look at me shedding no tears 
No worries followed by fear 
So good that soon you'll be here 
They just don't know How good it feels 

Feels so good to not be searching 
Searching just to find that someone 
Feels so good to not be searching 
Knowing that I found that right one 

I'm waiting for your love 
Waiting for your love 
I'm waiting for your love 
Waiting for your love
