Yea. Come on. Timbo! A. Keys,
Let's go!
Let me tell you something
Tell you how I feel
When he comes around
I get to feelin ill
It's a achy feelin inside my chest
It's like I'm going into cardiac arrest

[CHORUS:]
Adrenaline rushing in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
No matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny I got this...heartburn [repeat under]
Burnin in my soul
Call the fire department
It's out of control

Got me trippin', slippin', getting' beside myself
I tried some medication but don't nothin help
So I said "Docta, Docta, tell me will I die?"
And he said, "Count to 5 Alicia"
And I'm goin to be all right, Let's go! 1,2,3,4

[CHORUS:]
Adrenaline rushing in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
No matter how I keep on tryin
I can't deny I got this...heartburn [repeat under]
Burnin in my soul
Call the fire department
It's out of control

Tastes so good I can't resist 
Getting harder to digest
Can't take no more
Gotta shake it off, and break it down
And take it to the ground with me now
Everybody say OOOOHHHH...
Don't you know I got this...heartburn [repeat under]
Burnin in my soul
Call the fire department
It's out of control
What you tryin' to do?
Heartburn [repeat under]
Burnin in my soul
Call the fire department
It's out of control

Shake it Shake it Shake it off...go head girl
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...oohoohooh
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...go head girl
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...oohoohooh
Go head girl
Oohoohooh
