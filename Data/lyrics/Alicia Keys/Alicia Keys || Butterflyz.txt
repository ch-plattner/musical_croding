Lately when I look into your eyes
Baby I fly, you're the only one I need in my life
Baby I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflies
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

It seemed like the likely thing
From the start you told me yeah, I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring, I wanna give you everything

You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflyz


You and I
Are destiny
I know that
You were made for me

I can't control it
It's driving me
Taking over me and I

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control, I can't control it
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz, oh no, oh no


You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel
And I don't feel

You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel
Oh, I never felt like this
