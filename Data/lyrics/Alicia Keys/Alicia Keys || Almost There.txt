A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it
If you feel your hands
Slipping from mine
Just hold on tighter, darling
Keep on trying
Baby, do it for me
Do it, do it, do it, baby

Just one more step
Don't give up
Just one more step
Baby, baby, don't give up
Keep on, keep on
Just one more step

But nothing worth the wait ever is
And all our dreams can be ours
