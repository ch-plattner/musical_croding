
Come on, aha
You know

We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray

Pray for the world tonight
We gotta save
Somebody save somebody tonight

Fire in the air
What the hell going on
Sirens everywhere
Singing that street song
Violence everywhere
Barely holding on
What the hell going on
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people
Living an ordinary life
One extraordinary question
Are we gonna run or fight?
So we gotta pray

Pray for the love tonight
Another day
Pray for another try

Smoke is in the sky
What the hell going on
Bullets gonna fly
Ah, right from the gun
Trying not to cry
Barely holding on
What the hell going on
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people
Living an ordinary life
One extraordinary question
Are we gonna live or die?
So we gotta pray

We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
