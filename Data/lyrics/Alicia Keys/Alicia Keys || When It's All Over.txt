And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me

Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you

Hey, ask when I wanna leave
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you

Everybody say hey hey hey hey...

If I do nothing else, oh
If I do nothing else, oh
At least I got to love you, oh yeah
At least I got to love you, tell 'em baby

If I do nothing else, oh
Don't gotta do nothing else, oh oh
At least I got to love you, hey
At least I got to love you

Everybody say hey hey hey hey...
Everybody say hey hey hey hey...

Say mommy, (mommy)
Say I love you (I Love you)
(Buh-bye) Bye bye, already?
Can you say aye, (aye, no)
How about aye aye aye aye (aye aye aye)
Gooood boy, what's your name, (2Chainz)
Hahaha, but what's your name? (Egypt)
Amen, I love you!
(I love you, buh-bye)
(Crazy)
