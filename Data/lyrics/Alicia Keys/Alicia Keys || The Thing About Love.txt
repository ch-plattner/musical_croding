
Love
Love will come find you
Just to remind you
Of who you are

Oh love
It will forsake you
Threaten to break you
Take what you got

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Sure it could hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love

Friends
Sometimes will blind you
Sneak up behind you
You cant give enough

Then life
It will embrace you
Totally amaze you
So you don't give up

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Sure it could hurt you baby

But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love

Don't tell me that I'm not the only that's going through it all
Oh sometimes I feel like I'm the only that's going through it all
But its time
Oh its time
For me to shine
Hey
Its my time
Oh its time
For me to shine

Its my time
Said its my time
For me to shine
Its my time
Its bout time
For me to shine

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Sure it could hurt u baby
But give it a little try
That's the thing about love
That's the thing about love
That's the thing about
That's the thing about love
