When you're gone it feels like, 
My whole world's gone with you 
I thought love would be my cure 
But now it's my disease 
I try to act mature 
But I'm a baby when you leave 
How can I ever get used to being without you? 

(yeah) 

Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Am I addicted 
When I need you here all the time? 
And I'm not sure if this is healthy 
Is it a sickness? 
'cuz I feel like I'm losing my mind 

And I know that there's no medicine 
Nothing I can take, no remedy 
Baby please stay 

(ohohoohh) 
When you're gone it feels like, 
My whole world's gone with you 
I thought love would be my cure 
But now it's my disease (my disease) 
I try to act mature 
But I'm a baby when you leave 
How can I ever get used to being without you? 

Oh oh oh baby, baby, baby 
I get a fever 
Just the thought of you leaving my side 
Ohohhhh 
And I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me 
That's all I need 

(oh yeah) 
When you're gone it feels like (when you're gone baby) 
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you) 
I thought love would be my cure 
But now its my disease (my disease) 
I try to act mature 
But I'm a baby when you leave 
How can I ever get used to being without you 

Woah woah 
Here's what I'm going through when your gone 
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal 
(ohohoh) 
So sick of turning in my bed 
Waking up drenched in a cold sweat 
(ohohoh) 
Lying here lonely for you 
What am I supposed to do 
When I'm stuck and I cant get enough of your lovvvee 

Ohohoh woahhh Baby 

When you're gone it feels like (when your gone baby) 
My whole world's gone with you (gone with you) 
I thought love would be my cure 
But now it's my disease (my disease) 
I try to act mature 
But I'm a baby when you leave 
How can I ever get used to being without you?
