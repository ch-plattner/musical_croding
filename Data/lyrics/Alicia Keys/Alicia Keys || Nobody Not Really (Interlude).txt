Who really cares?
When I talk?
What I feel?
What I say?
Nobody, not really
Who wants to take
The time to understand?
I would like
Someone to heal me with some empathy
But I can't find
Nobody, not really
Maybe I'm invisible to the world
Does anyone on the world even think of me
As more than just a hopeless cause
Maybe the world is not my block
My stoop
My life, my dreams
My anything 
So, who wants to help?
Momma but she's so tired
Papa but you're not here
I'm alone in a big empty space with
Nobody, not really
