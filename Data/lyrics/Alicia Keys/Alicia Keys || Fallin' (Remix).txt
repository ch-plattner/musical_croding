(Chew it up, Chew it up, Chew it up)
Busta Bus' down somethin
Crucial Keys in the spot
Flipmode squad, come on
(Fall Fall Fall)
Rampage talk to em

[Rampage]
You was with me ma when I first copped my deal
Bought you the 5 karats plus the house on the hill 
The blue escalade with them new chrome-e wheels 
You told me the other day I dont know how you feel
Its been 5 months, I been driving you crazy
You told your friend the other day you was havin my baby
Sayin I'm acting funny, Ramp I'm so crazy
All you wanna do is be my number one lady
Fallin Fallin

[Alicia Keys (Busta Rhymes)]
I keep fallin, in and out, love with you
Sometimes I love you, some, times I'm blue
Sometimes I glow inside, other times you made me cry
Tell me what, am I to do, I'm so confused

[Chorus]
Tell me who, tell me what, tell me when
Tell me when, tell me how, how..
Tell me who, tell me what, tell me when
Tell me when, tell me why, I keep on fallin
In and out of love, with-a you, 
I never, loved someone like you (dont you never say never ma)
Im fallin, in and out of love,  with you, with you
I never, way that I love you (dont you never say never ma)

[Alicia Keys (Busta Rhymes)]
I never felt this way, tell me why I feel this way (come on)
How do you, give me such, (come on [3x]) pleasure and pain
And when I think, I taken all any fool can endour (ha)
Thats is when, I start to fall, for you once more 

[Busta Rhymes (Rampage)]
Every day and night, runnin the street 
I aint got no time for my shorty, thats why she gettin (wild for the night)
Even tho I show you my love, just becuz I stay on the hustle you be gettin (wild for the night)
I'on mean to be plushin you off, come on ma, I'm gettin this paper, so why you gettin (wild for the night)
Fo real ma, if I couldnt hold it down and take care of shit, you be really gettin (wild for the night)

[Alicia Keys]
I-I-I-I'm fall-falling, fall-fall-fall..

[Rampage (Alicia Keys)]
The heavy-weight, what went women that cant rest
Me and you up in the 600 S
Travelin for free from state to state
All we do is eat good and gain weight
When we argue its love and hate
Ma, I made the mistake you gave me a break
I got locked by the jake, you was right I had to take the whole cake
(baby got me fall-in)
Im a hustlin nigga, you know I aint fake, FALLIN!

[Alicia Keys (Busta Rhymes)]
With-a you, in and out of love
I never, love someone like you, love someone like you baby
Im fallin, with-a you, I never, said I never, way that I love you
I keep on fallin, in-and-out-of, with-a you, love-with-you
I never, no-i-never, love someone like you, love someone quite like my baby
Im fallin, fallin, with-a you, I never, neverr, way that I love you
(Spread it out y'all, move it out y'all, get it up y'all, keep it movin y'all, keep it goin y'all,
lets go lets go lets go
come on)
In love, out-of love, in love and outa love
Up and down, and back I fall
(Alicia Keys talk to em please!)
