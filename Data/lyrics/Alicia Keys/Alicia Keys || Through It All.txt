
In the morning when you wake 
Might not wanna face today and all your heartache 
Thinking how much can you take 
Please don't ever loose the faith and don't fall under 

In a world that seems to get colder & colder 
Don't you worry cuz 
My love will only get stronger & stronger 

[Chorus] 
Cuz I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all 
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall 
Through it all 
Through it all 

Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future 
Just live in the moment 
Long as there's another day there will be another way 
A chance to make it through 

In a world that seems to get colder & colder 
Don't you worry cuz 
My love will only get stronger & stronger 

[Chorus] 
Cuz I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all 
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall 
Through it all 

When you're down and out 
Losing dignity 
Don't let go of me (hold on) 
Surely this is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on) 
If you really looked inside 
You would finally realize 
You don't have to cry (no more) 
All you have to do is see 
That you can believe in me 
And I will never leave 

Cuz I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all 
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall 
Through it all
