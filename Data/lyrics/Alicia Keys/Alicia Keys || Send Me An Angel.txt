
Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get to somewhere

Sometimes I feel so heavy-hearted
But I can't explain cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear

And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there...
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel to guide me?

Sometimes I feel like a door with no key
And all the answers are locked away in me
But they're so hard to find
Especially when I'm feeling lost and so blind

Cause that's a lowly road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there...
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?

Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring

Cause that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please send me an angel
Can you send me an angel to guide me?
