
Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street, no food to eat
Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
Cause it's over when you said goodbye

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

Now I see myself through different eyes, it's no surprise
Being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I should've been there, I should've been there, I should've should've

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

I know I push you away
What can I do that will say how I love?
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
(I should've been there, I should been there, I should've should've)

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
