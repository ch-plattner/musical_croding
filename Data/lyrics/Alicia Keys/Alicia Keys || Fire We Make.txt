[Alicia:]
Hey baby how you doing tonight
I wanna let you know
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I wanna love you baby
And it's going so right
I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to the light

With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay away
No no no... (yeah)... no
(Oh yeah)
No No... (yeah)... stay away

[Maxwell:]
Hey baby, won't you tell me the truth
You wanna be the one
You can't stay away
Oh, hey darling
Don't you make no excuse
We can chase the sun
And burn the hole inside you

From the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
With the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away

[Alicia and Maxwell:]
This invisible pull; and it takes us to the stars
It's getting higher and higher
It's the fire we make (it's the fire we make)
Getting sweeter and sweeter
Like a night to a day
(About to make up these flames)
I can't stay away, say is, no no (yeah)
No no no, no no no, can't stay away (baby can't stay)
No no no (no you can't)
No no no (baby baby baby)

I just can't stay away
