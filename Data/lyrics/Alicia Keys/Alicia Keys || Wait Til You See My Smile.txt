
When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Pray to Him, He will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you safe
Stand strong and you will grow

[Chorus:]
Oh
Wait till you see my smile
Oh
Wait till they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you are on ground
Don't let emotions show
People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
See they say things they don't know

[Chorus]

So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever

[Chorus x2]
