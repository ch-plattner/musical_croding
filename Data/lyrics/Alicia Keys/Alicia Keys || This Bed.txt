Here I am 
And I been thinking about you lately 
Hold my hand 
'Cause I been missing you like crazy 

[Bridge] 
Don't wanna go through life, 
Every single night 
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right) 
Do it Right 
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight 
Rather spend my life with you, every night 
Cause baby.. 

[Chorus] 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you (Baby) 
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you 
Please be beside me 
These king size sheets 
Need more than just a queen 
In between 'em 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you 

So why don't we 
Go inside where we can be together? 
You mean more than anything 
Stay with me 
Wanna be with you forever 

[Bridge] 
Don't wanna go through life, 
Every single night 
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right) 
Do it Right 
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight 
Rather spend my life with you, every night 
Ooh baby.. 

[Chorus] 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you (Baby, baby bay) 
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
(I wanna hold you, hold you,) 
Please be beside me 
These king size sheets 
Need more than just a queen 
In between 'em (Yeah) 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you (Too lonely) 

[Talking] 
You know when it starts to get late 
And it's time to go to sleep, I 
I don't know what to do 
Cause I don't wanna hold my pillow 
I wanna hold you 

[Bridge] 
Don't wanna go through life, 
Every single night 
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right) 
Do me Right 
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight 
Rather spend my life with you, every night 
Oh baby.. 

[Chorus] 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you (Baby..baby) 
Don't wanna hold my pillow,
I wanna hold you (I wanna hold ya, hold ya) 
Please be beside me 
These king size sheets 
Need more than just a queen 
In between 'em (Yeah) 
This bed 
Is too lonely without you (Too lonely)
