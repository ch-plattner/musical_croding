You could buy me diamonds 
You could buy me pearls 
Take me on a cruise around the world 
Baby you know I'm worth it 
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath 
Make love tenderly to last and last
Baby you know I'm worth it 

Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right 
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time 
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first 
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth 

Mmm 
Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her 
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her 
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first 
And a real man just can't deny a womans worth 

Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm 
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm 
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm 
Mm 

If you treat me fairly 
I'll give you all my goods 
Treat you like a real woman should 
Baby I know you're worth it 
If you never play me 
Promise not to bluff 
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough 
Cause baby I know you're worth it 

She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true 
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you 
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first 
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth 

Oh 
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her 
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her 
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first 
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (spelled out for you) 
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value (better value) 
A woman's (woman's) 
Woman's (woman's) 
WORTH! 

Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her 
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her 
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first 
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 

[Repeat until end]
