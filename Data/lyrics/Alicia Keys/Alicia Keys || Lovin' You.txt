Yeah, let me, let me try something real quick

If I gave you forever
Would you take care of me?
Would you take me for granted?
Run away

Those wonderful things that you do
They've got me feeling in love with you
In love with you

Lovin you is easy
Comes so naturally
Lovin you is easy
Comes so naturally

I would give you laughter
So much more than that (oh yes, I would)
Anything you're after
I will climb the highest mountain, to bring it back
You'd better believe

Those wonderful things that you do
They've got me feeling in love with you
In love with you

Lovin you is easy
Comes so naturally
Lovin you is easy
Comes so naturally

I will stay by your side
Whether I'm wrong, whether I'm right
Oh, it's incredible
With you, I intend to spend the rest of my life

Lovin you is easy
Comes so, it comes so naturally
Lovin you is easy
Comes so, so, it comes so naturally

Lovin you is easy
So easy
Lovin you is easy
It comes so naturally

Lovin you is easy
Lovin you is easy (I'm in love with you forever)
It comes so naturally

Lovin you is easy
