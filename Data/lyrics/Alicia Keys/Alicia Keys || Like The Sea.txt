[Chorus:]
Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
Then it pulls you in 
Then it takes you, takes you 
Over, over 
Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
First you're floating high 
Then takes you takes you 
Under under 

Well it's cold 
Cold under water 
In the night time 
But I dove 
Dove to the bottom 
To see what I'd find 

That's when I saw a light 
A glowing paradise 
Thought I'd stay a while 
It's been calling me underwater, child 
Everything that I ever dreamed 

Taking my breath away 
Currents got hold of me 
Sweeping me away 
Wish that I could stay 
Takes me to the top 
It's the cycle that never stops 

Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
Then it pulls you in 
Then it takes you, takes you 
Over, over 
Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
First you're floating high 
Then takes you takes you 
Under under 

(takes you takes you over) 
(takes you takes you under) 
(takes you takes you over) 
Over! 
(takes you takes you under) 

Say: 

I've been told 
Told you only find it once in a lifetime 
So you better hold 
Hold on stronger then ever 
Like it's the last time 

So when you see the light 
Like a ship in the night 
You have found the place 
You been looking for 
Like a distant shore 
Don't you ever look back again 

Here's something you should know (know) 
The sea is still in control ([spoken:] that's right) 
Cherish everyday 
Cause you never know 
It can take away 
The very thing that you love the most (love the most) 

Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
Then it pulls you in 
Then it takes you, takes you (takes you, takes you over) 
Over, over 
Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees (leaves you on your knees) 
First you're floating high 
Then takes you takes you (takes you, takes you under) 
Under under 

(takes you takes you over) oh 
(takes you takes you under) 
(takes you takes you over) so far 
(takes you takes you under)
Listen, love is like the sea yeah 

(takes you takes you over) 
(takes you takes you under) can you feel the pull? 
(takes you takes you over) it's calling you 
(takes you takes you under) 

Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
Then it pulls you in 
(if you ever felt this way before) 
Then it takes you, takes you 
Over, (then you know) 
Over 
Love is like the sea 
Leaves you on your knees 
First you're floating high 
(oh get down on your knees) 
Then it takes you takes you 
Under under 
(take me away)
