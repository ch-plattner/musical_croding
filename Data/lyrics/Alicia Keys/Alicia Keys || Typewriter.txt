There we go ladies and gentlemen
Past all of the technical difficulties
That we have lead for experience
I will let you into my laboratory filled with many things
Writing intentions, you see
Such as my typewriter in the corner
Let me show you to the window
So you can see what I see, you know

Desperate am I to
Tell you how I feel for you
No sunshine when you're gone
Peaceful sleep I have none

How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
Well I know it won't last
I know that this will pass

You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
You capture what I say

I don't want to falsify
I want to make it right
Can't you see there's work to do
I'm trying to write to you

How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
Problem is, problem is
I'll give you space till you get over this

You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
You capture what I say

To torture a woman
Is to feed her loneliness
So please don't leave me lonely
Cause it's your mind that I miss

You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
You capture what I say
