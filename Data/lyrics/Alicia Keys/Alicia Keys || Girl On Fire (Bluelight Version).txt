[Spoken:]
Like a match to a flame

[Verse 1:]
She's just a girl and she's,
Hot like a flame she's on fire, on fire baby, on fire
Oh, oh yeah
She's filled with catastrophe
She's living in a world that's on fire, on fire baby, on fire
Oh, oh 

[Bridge:]
Oh, oh, she got her feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down
(Never)

[Chorus:]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl, and I'm on fire.
(Like a match to a flame
She's a match to a flame
I'm a flame)

[Verse 2:]
She looks like a girl, but she, yeah, she's really just a flame
You can try but you'll never, you'll never forget her 
On fire, On fire baby, on fire
Oh, oh yeah
She so bright, she'll burn your eyes
Better look the other way
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest
On fire, on fire baby, on fire
Oh, oh

[Bridge 2:]
Oh, oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, oh, we got our head in the clouds
And we're not backing down
(Never)

[Chorus:]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
(Like a match to a flame
She's a girl in a flame
I'm a match to a flame)

[Verse 3:]
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Chorus:]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl, and I'm on fire

Yeah [x5]
Said I'm a girl, and I'm on fire (Match to a flame)

Oh [x5]
I'm a girl, and I'm on fire (Like a match to a flame)
