Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feelin'
No one but me and you

[Hook:]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets (yes, I will)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away.
Oh, baby if there is anything that you fear (anything)
Just call my number baby, baby and I'll be here

Only we know what is talked about, baby boy

Baby when you're in town why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need
You can trust me, boy, a-ha
