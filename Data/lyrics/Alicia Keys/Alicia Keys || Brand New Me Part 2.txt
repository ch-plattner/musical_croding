
She wakes up early in the morning just to do her hair y'all
Cause it's a new her
She just wanna live her life tryin' to find her freedom
Been looking for freedom
She may not see the light but she wants it, she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror

(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do - she's rollin')
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'

They try hard not to care about her new life
They got their own mess
But none of this is for you cause this is her life
Don't need you to apologize
She found a brand new me as she stares herself in the mirror

(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do - she's rollin')
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'

In my sleep I see her beggin', reaching from me
It took a long road to get here
It took a brave girl, brave girl for trying
She's just like you and me 'cause she wants it, she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror

(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do
She do what she's supposed to do
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me - she's rollin')
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She from the block and she's rollin
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
She's rollin'
