Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh [4x]

[Verse 1]
Broken promises
My heart you stole
Lies you told
Got the best of me
Digging in my heart of gold
Used to look at you
And see the possibilities
I see you for who you are
Boy you've disappointed me

[Hook]
I thought you gave me love
Was never near enough
Soon enough time reveals
The weight of what is real
Know all I need to know
But see you got to go
What have you've given me?
But lies lies

[Chorus]
Go head go on and get up out of here
Go head baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'm gone fall for this anymore
Everybody say no no no no no
Everybody say no no no no no

[Verse 2]
Used to believe in every word you said
Clouds my head
Leaving me here to drown
Hopes and dreams left for dead
You point your finger
Trying to justify your mistakes
A change is goin to be made
So you best be on your way

[Hook]

[Chorus]

No need to apologize
Don't try to make it right
I know
I should known better
When you took hold
I was sold
Using fear to control
Now it unfolds
Let me tell you right now
What I'm gonna do
made up my mind
It's time and I'm through with you
Nothing you can say or can do
Can make me change me mind

[Chorus]
