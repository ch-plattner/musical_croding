It feels kinda crazy

These covers
May keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
Cause they never gonna hold me tight

And these pillows
May let me rest my head
But they can't say good night
And tuck me in before I go to bed

Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else

[Chorus:]
These lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
When you walked inside, oh baby

If these walls could sing
About everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
And it'll probably sound something like this

Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else

[Chorus:]
These lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Everytime I think, I'm getting closer
Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose

These lips are missing you
These lips ain't kissing you
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
These arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Crying like oh oh...
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh...
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
