[Nicki Minaj:]
Spirit of Marilyn
Callin' me, audibly, bawlin' she
Said that she would never leave
Continue to torture me
Tellin' me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Took me on the balcony
Tellin' me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost but, I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't tryna be that
Haters wanna see that
But I got 'em aggy
Cause I win the gold like Gabby

[Alicia Keys:]
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, oh oh oh oh
She got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
She got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl but she's a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh, oh oh oh oh
We got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Everybody stares as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Nicki Minaj:]
Dear God, if you're here God
Make the fire disappear when they stare God
Take away the fear when they interfere God
Do you fear God?
Cause I fear God
And in my backyard, that's a deer, God
And that's a horse ranch
And to my core fans, keep reppin' me, do it to the death of me
X in the box, cause ain't nobody checking me

[Alicia Keys:]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Oh, oh, oh...

She's just a girl and she's on fire
