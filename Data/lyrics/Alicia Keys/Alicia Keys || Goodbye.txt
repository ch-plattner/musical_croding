How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good
Was all he ever had?

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Givin' up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with somethin' once so good

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)

I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead
And I'm not tryin' to take away
From the good man that he is

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Was it somethin' wrong that we did
Because others infiltrated
What went wrong with somethin' once so good

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)

Is this the end, are you sure?
How should you know when you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
When this is the one and only love I've ever known

So, how do you find the words to say
To say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)
