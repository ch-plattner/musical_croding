[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
When I wake up in the morning babe
Can't believe my eyes
Sweetest little part of destiny
Oh yeah
Cause you are now in my life
There ain't no man or prize
Oh noo
Can compare to you
Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feeling
When I look at you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I'm just speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away
I'm speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
True love finally finds you babe
Life becomes a way
Previously unimaginable
Oh yeah
Listen I don't wanna say
It only happens once if even at all
Feel it deep in your soul
And like a fairytale your story begins yeah
What a sight to behold
Makes you...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Eve]
In the mornings when I rise up
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Stare in the clouds like wow look at my luck
Everyday I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
We can't fall quick
Remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude think he so it
Think he so fly
And a'time you try to talk to me I'm like yo don't even dare try
I was on my solo groove I ain't want nothing I ain't need nothing
Man I'm good
Now I'm speechless
Cause I fell for him
The poet in me died
Cause I fell for him

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I used to know all the words to say
I used to write all the poetry
But now you take my breath away
