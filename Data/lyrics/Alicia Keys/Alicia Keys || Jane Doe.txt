What's up, Kandi?
Man, these Jane Doe's be killing me thinking they're slick with it
(For real)
Drop the beat
Alicia Keys, Kandi collabo

Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
It negative in every which way
Just dissing my man and our relation
You say he's cheating, want me to leave him
I changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listening to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm trying to be

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no

You see I caught you trying to check my man out
How 'bout you explain, what that's all about
You think ya slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you, Doe
Mess around end up in a choke-hold
Girl I think it's time for you to go
Away from my man and me
That's the way it's gonna be

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no

I love my man, he loves me more
He may not be the perfect man, but I don't plan to let him go
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no

Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
