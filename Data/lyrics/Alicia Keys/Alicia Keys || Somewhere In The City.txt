
Just the other day...
I was looking out the window
And I was thinking...
Somewhere in a city just like mine, uh

Somewhere in a city like mine
Sky is falling
Somewhere in a city like mine
Father's calling

Seas are rising
See yours crying
Dreams may wash away
But we're surviving
Mothers trying
Help us see our ways

So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone
There's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love's the reason we're here

Uh, yeah, come on
Say, say it one more time

Somewhere on an island like mine
World is shaking
Somewhere on an island like mine
Hearts are breaking

Seas are rising
Birds are diving
Dreams may wash away
But we're surviving
Mothers trying
To help us see our ways

So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone
There's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love's the reason we're here

I know, I know, I know
It feels like some things will never change
Oh Lord
Come on, come on, come on
Don't get down
Just start to be the change
That you want in the world
So...

You gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone
There's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love's the reason we're here

Ooh
Everybody knows that love...
Ooh oh, uhuh
