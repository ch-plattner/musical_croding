[Verse 1: Jimmy Cozier]
Something about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if you're alone, don't want to cramp your style
But I cannot deny the feel that I feel when I looked straight into your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for the challenge may arise

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much Remy, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watching me, I feel something down my spine
I'll play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight
All night

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Jimmy Cozier]
I know all you wanna know is answers
Cause you can give me what I need
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires, should we let our desires lead?

[Chorus x3]
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
