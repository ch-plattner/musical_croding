In a middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said
It was just there

Right then
I didn't have time even over think it
I looked at you and all of a sudden (haha) I was all in

It's like my knees are all weak and them butterflies
They were dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew... that's when I knew... that's when I knew

That day
I didn't know where we were going
Where the night would end
I didn't know there was somethin' brewing, and if it was
I didn't know how much I'd care

That touch
When you barely held my hand
I was overcome with feelings I don't understand
Not in a millions years I didn't think that we'd be here

It's like my knees are all weak and them butterflies
Got me dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear, ohhhh

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew... that's when I knew... that's when I knew
Don't you know it, hey
That's when I knew... that's when I knew... that's when I knew, baby

You know if you know
You know whatcha feel
And there's no denying
I know that's for real
There's nothing to do
Just let it in
Gotta surrender

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I fell in love

(That's when I knew) [repeats until end]

Ohhhh

That's when I knew it... that minute
That's when I knew... it was dependable
Sometimes you get it
Sometimes you get it
That's when I knew it baby
Yeah... that's when I knew... that's when I knew we fell in love
