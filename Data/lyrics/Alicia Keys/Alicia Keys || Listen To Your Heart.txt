
He says
Have no fear
Open up
Let me in

He says
Take a chance
Here's your song
Time to dance

Ohhhh ooooooooo
What you're gonna do when it comes for you
Ohhhh ooooooooo
Listen to your heart

Oh, You gotta listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Oh, Why don't you listen to your heart

He says
Here's your sky
Don't look down
We can fly

You said
You're a little bit scared
Just hold on
We're almost there

Ohhhh ooooooooo
What you're gonna do when it comes for you
Ohhhh ooooooooo
Listen to my heart

Oh, You gotta listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Oh, Why don't you listen to your heart

You never know until you try
Why so scared when hearts don't lie
Turn off the world and close your eyes
Lose yourself and listen to your heart

Oh, Why don't you listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Oh, Why don't you listen to your heart

Hey
Ohhhh ooooooooo
You know what to do when it comes for you
Ohhhh ooooooooo
Hey yeah

You gotta listen baby [x4]
Aha, You gotta listen to it
Ah, can't you hear it
You gotta listen baby
Mmm
