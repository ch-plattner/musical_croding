AK, new day
AK, auu!

Party people say, party people say
Ay, it’s a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody's ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ay, ay, ay, ay

It's alright to feel however you want to
There's no limitation no
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
I celebrate mine, cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night
One time, everybody say ay ay oh

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same, everybody say

Party people say, party people say
Ay, it’s a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody's ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ay, ay, ay, ay

Take a look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready
Come along, let's get it, eh
If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night, and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life
Left to live it up, one life left to live it up

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same, everybody say

Party people say, party people say
Ay, it’s a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody's ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ay, ay, ay, ay

Clock's on the wall
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all
Whether I rise or fall
I’m gonna give it my all

Party people say, party people say
Ay, it’s a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody's ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say...

Celebrate and say...

Celebrate and say...

Celebrate and say...
