
There's no escape on the spell you have placed 
Leaving my heart and my mind
Foolish am I if I was to try to ever leave you behind

I wanna rock wit you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit you
Wit you wit only you, wit you wit only you
I wanna rock wit you

I'll stay and walk this life wit you
No matter what we may go through
Dead broke, no job, no house, no ride
I'm goin' stay right by your side 

I wanna rock wit you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit you
Wit you wit only you, wit you wit only you
I wanna rock wit you

Don't question where you're headed to, my love
Don't be afraid, just believe in love

I wanna rock wit you
No matter what we do
Wit you wit only you
I wanna rock wit you

I wanna rock wit you
No matter what we do
Wit you with only you
I wanna rock wit you

I wanna rock wit you
No matter what we do
Wit you wit only you
I wanna rock wit you

do your thing, do your thing, 
do your thing, do your thing
[fade out]
