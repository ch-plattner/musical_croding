I'm a woman, lord knows it's hard
I need a real man to give me what I need
Sweet attention, love and tenderness
When it's real it's unconditional, I'm telling y'all

[Chorus:]

Cause a man, just ain't a man, 
If he aint' man enough 
To love you when you're right,
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak,
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin low.
He's given you his last, cuz he's thinking of you first
Given comfort when you're thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all.
Cause you're a real man and lord knows it's hard
Sometimes you just need a woman's touch
Sweet affection, love and support
When it's real, it's unconditional, I'm telling y'all

[Chorus:]

Oh cause a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak,
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin low.
She's giving you her best, even when you're at your worst
Givin comfort, when she's thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done, when you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
Whooo
Whooo
Whooo
Whooo
Whooo
Whooo
Sometimes you gonna argue
Sometimes you gonna fight
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it will never be right
But something so strong, keeps you holdin on
It don't make sense, but it make a good song
Cause a man, just ain't a man, 
If he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right,
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak,
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin low
He's given you his last, cuz he's thinking of you first
Given comfort when you're thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all
That a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak,
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher and higher
When the world got you feelin low.
She's giving you her best, even when you're at your worst
Givin comfort, when she's thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done, when you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
Hmm hmm yeah
Hmm hmm yeah
Hmm hmm yeah

Hmm hmm yeah
Hmm hmm yeah
Hmm hmm yeah
Hmm hmm yeah [and fade out]
