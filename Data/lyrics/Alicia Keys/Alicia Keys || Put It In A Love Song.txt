[Alicia] 
Hey yo B 
[Beyonce] 
What up A 
[Alicia] 
What we want? 
[Beyonce] 
Want them to say 

[Chorus] 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song) 
Say you need me, Say you need me 
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh) 
Say you want me, Say you want me 
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone) 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put me in a love song (Oh) 

[Alicia] 
If you say you want me, yeah, 
You say you want me 
If you do the right thing, we can be together 
I'm not easy, yeah, you gotta work for it 
I'm the real thing, and baby gotta please me 

All that talkin', boy, you better walk it 
All that frontin' that's not how you do it 
If you really need me like you say you need me 
Baby better show me, baby, better come and say 

[Chorus] 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song) 
Say you need me, Say you need me 
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh) 
Say you want me, Say you want me 
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone) 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put me in a love song (Oh) 

[Beyonce] 
What you gonna do when somebody convinces me 
To believe that he can do it better 
Sending me gifts and showing me the romance 
All this, this, and that, can you do better? 

All I'm saying: love is what I'm looking for 
If you wanna keep me, baby gotta love me more 
If you really want me, like you say you want me 
If you really need me, baby better come and say 

[Chorus] 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song) 
Say you need me, Say you need me 
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh) 
Say you want me, Say you want me 
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone) 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put me in a love song (Oh) 

[Alicia] 
Gotta work it baby, work it out 
If you want me baby, Work it out 
If you need me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it out, Gotta Work it out 

[Beyonce] 
If you love me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it baby, Work it out 
If you want me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it out, Gotta work it out 

[Alicia] 
If you want my love and all my time 
Part of my plans and part of my mind 
[Beyonce] 
All of the things that you wanna do 
But make sure your love for me's true to you 
[Alicia] 
Oh, If you show me; make me believe 
[Beyonce] 
So many possibilities 
[Alicia] 
Oh, We can look to infinity 
[Alicia & Beyonce] 
If you wanna be with me Ohhhhhhh 

[Chorus] 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song) 
Say you need me, Say you need me 
Then write it in a letter for me (Oh oh oh) 
Say you want me, Say you want me 
Then text me on the cell phone (Text me on my cell phone) 
Say you love me, Say you love me 
Then put me in a love song (Oh) 

[Alicia]

[Alicia] 
Gotta work it baby, work it out 
If you want me baby, Work it out 
If you need me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it out, Work it out 
[Beyonce] 
If you love me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it baby, Work it out 
If you want me baby, Work it out 
Gotta work it out, Gotta work it out
