
Like a damsel in distress
I'm stressing you
My castle became my dungeon cuz I'm longing for you
I'm Feeling strong for ya
You're my knight in shining armor
See your face in the silver moon
Hung over the lagoon
And it feels like

[Chorus:]
Dragon days and the fire's hot
Like a desert need water
I need you a lot
Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
And the day drags on and on

I'm desperate for ya baby
Do you know what that means?
It means I feel like an addict must feel
When he feigns 
In an act of desperation I get lost in ma dreams
Cuz like a lady I'm waiting, waiting for ya
Like a prisoner tied over alligator waters
Waiting for my prince of paradise to come and take me away
From these

[Chorus]

[Guitar break]

[Chorus x2]
