
One of these days  
I'm gonna wake up 
Skies gonna be blue 
One of these days 
I'm gonna wake up 
To a sun shinning through 
One of these days 
This song is gonna be true 
And the world, the world is gonna be brand new

One of these days 
I'm gonna wake up 
And I'm gonna feel fine 
One of these days 
I'm gonna wake up 
And my dreams are gonna be mine 
One of these days 
This song is gonna be true 
And the world, the world is gonna be brand new

It's gonna sound like music 
Oh, sweet music 
And everybody is gonna want 
To sing along 
It's gonna sound like music 
Oh, sweet music 
And everybody in the world 
Is gonna sing this song

They gonna say la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

One of these days 
I'm gonna wake up 
And I'm gonna be free 
One of these days 
I'm gonna wake up 
Break these chains holding me 
One of these days 
This song is gonna be true 
And the world, the world is gonna be brand new

It's gonna sound like music 
Oh, sweet music 
And everybody is gonna want 
To sing along 
It's gonna sound like music 
Oh, sweet music 
And everybody in the world 
Is gonna sing this song

They gonna say la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Oh, one of these days
One of these days
I know, I know
Oh, one of these days
The world, the world is gonna be brand new
