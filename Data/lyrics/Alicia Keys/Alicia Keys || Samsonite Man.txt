He's a man so full of style and grace
Any woman'd be impressed
Takes a smile and paints it on your face
Makes you feel like you've been blessed
Promises things so special
It seems to come right from a song
But soon as you begin to feel secure
You turn around and he is gone

[CHORUS:]

Packin' his bags
Gotta go gotta go
Packin his bags
Gotta go
He's a Samsonite man
Maybe he is just a rolling stone
Wondering from here to there 
Searching for a place to call his own
You wonder if he even cares?
So many years of heartache and pain
Is all you seem to know him for
Is it you or is it he to blame
Whenever he walks out your door

[CHORUS: 1X]

[BRIDGE:]

Should the wind blow you in my direction
You come through to rendezvous
Forget about your good intentions, 
They leave me lonely and confused
Mr. Samsonite
Pack a bag that is my suggestion
From here and out, you will be leaving 
At My discretion!

[BREAK AND CHORUS]
