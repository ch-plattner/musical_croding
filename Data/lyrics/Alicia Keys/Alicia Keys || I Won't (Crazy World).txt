
I cross the dryest desert
Just so came there to you
If I couldn't find you there
What in the world am I to do?

'Cause I won't lie
And I won't deceive you
So can't we try
To make it just like what we dreamed
Hmm, yeah yeah yeah

Devotion is my name
And I give myself to you, oh
In this crazy world of mine
Your inspiration gets me through

So I won't lie
And I won't deceive you
So can't we try
To make it just like what we dreamed
Hmm, yeah yeah yeah

In this whole world there's nothing I want more
Than to give you all that you desire
To make your world a little brighter
There is nothing that I would not do

(Crazy world of mine)
You make me rely true love
(Crazy world of mine)
And I, I will make sure that it lasts
(Crazy world of mine)
Just by dedicating all my time
(Crazy world of mine)
If you stay in this crazy world of mine
(Crazy world of mine)

Come join this crazy world of mine
(Crazy world of mine)
Come join this crazy world of mine
(Crazy world of mine)
Come join this crazy world of mine
(Crazy world of mine)
Come join this crazy world of mine
(Crazy world of mine)

So I won't lie
(I love you, I love you)
And I won't deceive you
(I won't deceive you, no)
So can't we try
(Yes we can, I know we can, I know we can)
To make it just like what we dreamed
Just like what we dreaming
Just like what we dreaming, yeah

Now here's some loving for you, my darling
I'll give you all of my time
