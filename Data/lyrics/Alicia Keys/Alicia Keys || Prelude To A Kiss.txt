Mhmmmm... yeah yea yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Mhmhmh [x3]

Sometimes I feel..... like I don't belong anywhere.
And it's gonna take.... so long for me to get to somewhere......... 

Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted.., but I can't explain cuz I'm so guarded.
But that's a lonely road to travel, and a heavy load to... bear. 

And it's a long, long way to heaven but I gotta get there.....
Can you send an angel.....?
Can you send me an angel...... to guide me.
