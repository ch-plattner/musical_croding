What, where am I?

What's life like on a train
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came

I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

[Chorus:]
This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody

Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me

I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

[Chorus:]
This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep 

[Chorus:]
One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody

I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one thing
