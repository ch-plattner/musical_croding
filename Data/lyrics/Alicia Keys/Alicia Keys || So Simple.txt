
It would be, it would be 
It would be so simple
What it is ain't what it was
What should it be when it comes to you and....
How it seems ain't how it is
There's been a change when it comes to me and...

[Chorus:]

Oh baby you
Oh baby me
Oh maybe we can try another day
Another way
All in my mind
I'm wondering why we cannot find
What was left of the beginning
If I could
Meet you again, 
Miss you again, 
Kiss you again
It would be, it would be so simple
Cause I would love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
It would be, it would be
Could it be, could it be so simple
Now it's hardly simple,
It's just simply hard 
When it comes to you and
I find myself not being myself
Just to avoid all this confrontation with
Oh baby you
Oh baby me
Oh maybe we can put this armor down
And settle down
Oh it's off track
That is a fact
Can we get it back
Get it back to the beginning
If I could meet you again,
Miss you again, 
Kiss you again
It would be, it would be so simple
Cause I would love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
It would be, it would be
Could it be, could it be so simple
Don't you know that it would be
Don't you know that it could be
Don't you know that it would be
Meet you again,
Miss you again, 
Kiss you again
It would be, it would be so simple
Cause I would love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
It would be, it would be
Could it be, so simple
