Have you ever felt so strong
That it made you feel weak
Long days
Long nights
And you just can't sleep

Have you ever been so sure
That it gave you cold feet
That felt all bare
You can feel your heart beat

Well I never knew this feeling never
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I am riding high
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
And If I can touch the sky
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly

(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah

Have you ever felt so lost
But didn't know until you were found
Looking everywhere
What you finally see know

In the room full of people
Feels like no one's around
Got your head in the clouds
And your feet are off the ground

Say I never knew this feeling, never
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I am ridin high
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
And If I can touch the sky
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We get to go

(Higher)
Higher
Higher)
Higher
Higher

[x2]
I am ridin high
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
And If I can touch the sky
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah [x3]
