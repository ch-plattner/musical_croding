
ahhhh...
ahhhhhhhh...

There will never come a day
You will never hear me say
That I want to or need to be without you
I want to give my all; baby, just hold me
Simply control me
Because your arms they keep away the loneliness

When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
Cause I never felt this way about loving, no
Never felt so good, baby, never felt this way about loving
It feels so good
