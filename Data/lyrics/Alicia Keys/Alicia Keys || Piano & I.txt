Didn't know I was here

Do you know my name?
(Can't go wrong when you try)
Always got to try
No matter how long that shit take
Yeah, yeah
Whatever stops you from dreaming
Whatever tries to stop you from living
Flip it

Welcome home
Cause right now what I have to do
Is I gotta amp myself up as well as you
So, yeah, so what it took me like
Maybe two years and shit
But I'm feeling prepared
You know what I'm saying?
And I'm feeling a little more ready for the world
And less lost
As I once was

So come on
What you waiting on?
Feel me, feel me, feel me
What, uh, yeah
What, uh, yeah
What
