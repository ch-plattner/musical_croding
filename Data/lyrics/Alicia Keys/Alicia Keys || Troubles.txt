
Dear Lord, can you take it away?
This pain in my heart just follows me by day
And at night it stalks me like the shadows on my wall
Oh my goodness, goodness

Feel like the world is closing on me
Feel like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared

[Chorus:]
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know, I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place?

[Chorus:]
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

[Piano Solo & Sirens]

[Chorus x4]

Cause I will run to you
You don't have to worry
Amen
