Maybe silly for me to feel
This way about you and her
Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through
Talkin' late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'?
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

You said that she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real
And I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me
To even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Jermaine Dupri:]
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why
Say you jealous but you can't tell me why

[Alicia:]
It's enough to make a nigga go crazy

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
