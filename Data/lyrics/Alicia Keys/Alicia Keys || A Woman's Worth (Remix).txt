Take me on a cruise around the world
A dozen roses ‘cause I’m your girl
And you know I’m worth it (uh huh) worth it
Dinner lit by candles under sun
Run my bubble bath ‘cause I’m the one
You want to love so tenderly
And you know I’m worth it (say what) I’m worth it

Wanna to please wanna to keep wanna to treat your woman right (right)
Not just doe but a show let you know she is worth your time (time)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first (first)
She will find a man who knows a worth

So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
If you feel me, then clap your hands
If you’re worth it, worth it
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples, who understand
Represent your woman your woman your woman 
your woman your woman’s worth 

If you treat me fairly I’ll give you my goods
Show you all the things no one else would
Treat you like a real woman should
‘Cause I know you’re worth it (say what) your worth it
If you never play me, now don’t you bluff
I promise you can get it all
I’ll hold you now when s*** gets rough
‘Cause I know your worth it (say what) your worth it

She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true (true)
Don’t take for granted the passion she has for you (you)
If you choose to refuse you will lose, put her first (first)
She will find a man who knows a worth

All my real men, wave your hands
