
Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin of a million ways
to escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and i
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

Dreamin' bout you
i keep dreamin' bout you
when im dreamin' bout when you would say

[chorus]
let me take you to another place
where nothing ever seems to matter
its just you and me
we can take flight like a thief in the night
stolen moments with you (o0ohhh o0o0oh)

[Verse 2]
Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
how could age define
something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

Dreamin' bout you
i keep dreamin' bout you
when im dreamin' bout when you would say

[chorus]

[piano breakdown]

Dreamin' bout you
i keep dreamin' bout you
when im dreamin and waiting for the day
when noone and nothing else takes up our time
finally you're only mine

each and everyday
I'd walk with with you right by my side
but instead we have to hide
sneak around and lie
just to spend time alone
If lovin is a crime
i'd rather do the time
and leave the world behind

[chorus]

[piano breakdown 2]

Let's get away
Let's get away
oooh ooh

we can get away
we can get away
ohhh ohhh

Let's get away
Let's get away
ohhh ohhh

we can get away
we can get away
ohhh ohhh
