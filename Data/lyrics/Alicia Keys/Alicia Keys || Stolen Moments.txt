Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways to escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
When nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

But destiny didn't have such a simple plan
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define something so divine
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
When nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' and praying for the day

When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine

Each and everyday I'd walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide, sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
If lovin' is a crime, I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

Let me take you to another place
When nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

Let's get away, let's get away, oh
We can get away, we can get away, oh
Let's get away, let's get away, oh, oh
We can get away, we can get away, oh
