Right now, I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile, I cry
They don't know what they're doing to me
Keeping me from flying
That's why I say that...

I know why the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?

So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreading her wings and her song
Let her
Fly, fly fly
For the whole world to see

She's like caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh just let her fly
Just let her fly
Just let her fly
Spread the wings
Spread the beauty
