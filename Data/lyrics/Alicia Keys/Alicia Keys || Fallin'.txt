[Verse 1]
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh , I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
Ive taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

[Bridge]
Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall

I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Im fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Im fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

What?
