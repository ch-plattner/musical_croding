Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love

Hold up, wait, before you go just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, uh?

See what you don't understand is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush
Call you my man
Doubt that I'd ever fall in love you,
Ever fall in love again

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Hold up, wait, shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See what you don't understand is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush
I call you my man
Doubt that I'd ever fall in love you,
Ever fall in love again

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you,
Nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Saving my trust
Don't mess this up
(You got me fallin' in love, you got me fallin' love, you got me fallin' so hard)
Boy you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear that you're the boy that all I need
My baby

Nothin' but lovin' you,
Nothin' but lovin you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby

Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love
Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love
