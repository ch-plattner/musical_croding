Things you never ever knew before
Mhm, like "i" before "e" except after "c"
And why 2 + 2 makes 4

Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you
All about love boy
Sit yourself down and take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[x2:]
ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi
ABC, 123, baby you and me, boy

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of a learning tree
But listen without the roots of love everyday
Boy, your education ain't complete

Teacher gonna show you
How to get an A (how to get an A)
Spell me and you and add the two
Listen to me baby
That's all you gotta do

ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi
ABC, 123, baby you and me, boy

It's easy, it's like counting up to 3
Or sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be [x2]
Sing a simple melody
123, baby you and me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, boy

Shake it, shake it, baby [x3]

123 it baby, ABC it baby
Do, Re, Mi, it baby
That's how easy love can be

ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi
ABC, 123, baby you and me, boy

I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

[x2:]
ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi
ABC, 123, baby you and me, boy

ABC, 123, ABC, 123, baby you and me
