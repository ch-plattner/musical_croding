Hey

I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doing what I like
I'm over here working day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, bae

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
Cause I'm about to put them all away (ooh)

Focus on me, f-f-focus on me (ooh)
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me (ooh)
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (ooh) (Focus on me)
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (ooh) (Focus on me)

I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit (hhii)
I know you're hoping that I'll react
I know you're hoping I'm looking back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is (yeah)

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
Cause I'm about to put them all away (ooh)

Focus on me (hey), f-f-focus on me (ooh)
Focus on me (hhooo), f-f-focus on me (ooh)
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me, yeah)
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)

Oooh yeah

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down (keep on holdin us down)
Just come and get it, let them say what they say (let them say what they say, say)
Cause I'm about to put them all away (now)

Focus on me (hhoo), f-f-focus on me
