
I don't wanna be
(Wanna be) alone babe.
Unless I'm alone (unless I'm alone) Unless I'm alone babe.
'Cause it won't be (won't be) cause it won't be.
Hold you close babe, hold you close the way that I used to.
'Cause it won't be, no it won't be. 'Cause it won't...

There's people on the sidewalk, music in the air.
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here.
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do.
'Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you.

I don't wanna spend this time without you.
I just wanna hold you close to me, kiss beside the Christmas tree.
Baby say you'll be coming home.

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It's won't be Christmas.
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be, it won't be.
Unless I'm alone with you

Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms.
Keep from the cold, you'll be safe and warm.
We're classic love together, the love that never dies.
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes.

It's the weather time to be together.
There's no sadder time to be alone, hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It's won't be Christmas.
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be, it won't be.
Unless I'm alone with you

I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me, kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby say you'll be coming home
Coming home

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
