
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, the one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
But I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

So hurry down the chimney tonight
(Waiting!)
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
