
I told you once, "Get out my life.
I don't need ya, I'll be alright."
But some things are better left unsaid.

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid,
Are better left unsaid, said, said...

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
I'm gonna say things like, "Shut up and kiss me!"
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me.

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me.
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said...

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
I'm gonna say things like, "Shut up and kiss me!"
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me.

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me.
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me.
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up

You tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that some things are better left unsaid
