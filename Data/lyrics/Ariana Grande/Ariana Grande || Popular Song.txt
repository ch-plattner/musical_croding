La la, la la
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
But you were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
So catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go

I was on the lookout for someone to hate
Picking on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between them
Dunked me in the toilets now it's you that cleans 'em
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone's laughing, got everyone clapping, asking,
"How come you look so cool?"
'Cause that's the only thing that I learnt at school, boy
I said that's the only thing I learnt at school

My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
But you were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
So catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go

All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you.
That's all you ever need to know
It's all you ever need to know
