I want you to love me, like I'm a hot car ride

I want you to take it like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin', you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night
Ooh, ho

Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Cause I'm the only one who understands, how to make you feel like a man

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
