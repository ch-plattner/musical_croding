
Last night was crazy, and today it's settin' in
Did you really mean it and could you say it again? oh, oh
Even if you just say it over the phone (come on and make it real)

Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb, and paranoid (oh, yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee, I'm the only girl you see
Whatchu say, boy?

[Iyaz:]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee (am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

[Ariana Grande:]
Every day and night, you got an open invitation (woah-oh)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me, I'll be your fantasy

You're in demand, but baby, baby so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak, I'll have to tell you bye-bye.
I'm a put you on the spot, am I your only girl or not?
What ya say, boy?

[Iyaz:]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee (am I your only)
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only)
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee (am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

See yeah back in the day I was trapped in a daze.
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed.
(Same Old!) When I see you passing, the passionate flames.
Simple interaction is all that I crave.
I don't need agreement, and all the attention,
Girl I need you, your love and affection.
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

You're my only shorty (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee (baby, come clean!)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee (am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

Am I your only?
Am I your only?
Tell me, am I your only shorty? (yes, you are.)
Wanna hear you say, yeah (yes, you are.)
Am I your only shawty.
