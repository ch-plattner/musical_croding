
Say you love me
As much as I love you yeah
Would you hurt me baby
Could you do it to me yeah
Would you lie to me baby
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
Leave my heart still at the door

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop boy

You know,
This ain't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships and uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time my boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me!

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules baby
If this is a lesson
Baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop boy

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop boy

If I could die
I'mma make you believe boy
I wouldn't mind
Ay ay oh
Don't stop baby no no oh
It's what you do to me yeah
Whoa, no no no no no no
Oh
If I could just die
Oh
Baby please don't go boy
No no no no no no
