Mhmm... 

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never been so... Satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
but I like the way you feel
Inside... 

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing in my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

It feels like a dream 
When you love me tenderly 
I don't know if you're for real
but I like the way you feel 
Inside 

You've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions 
Higher than the heavens above 

You've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
Oh baby, 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above 

You know the way
To make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so... Highhhh

Alright

Ohhh, you've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above 

Ohh you've got me feeling emotions
Ohh you've got me feeling emotions
You..
You..
You've got me feeling higher
