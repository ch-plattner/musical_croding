[Verse 1:]
Dear Santa,
It's me Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need
Your help this year
Let me make this clear

See I really love him
And it's been kinda tough cause
He's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away
Away from me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

[Chorus:]
Just make it snow in California
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

[Verse 2:]
Dear Santa,
What happened to the plan we had
I checked the news and it said
It'd be a sunny day
Make it go away

See I, I really need him to stay
For a couple more days
Can't you make his
Five o'clock flight delay
Won't you find a way?

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

[Chorus:]
Just make it snow in California
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

[Bridge:]
I know I'm asking for the impossible
But I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me
So please, please

[Chorus:]
Just make it snow in California
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a
