Hercules, Hercules!

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O.
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat

From zero to hero
In no time flat
Zero to hero
Just like that

When he smiled
The girls went wild with "ooh"s and "aah"s
And they slapped his face on every vase
(on every "vase")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what the Grecians "earn"!

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk?

Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor

Hercules
Hercules
Hercules
Hercules
Hercules
Hercules

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed

From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

Yes indeed!
