They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
But they don't understand
They don't understand, no

If you want
A perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
And you think you know but you don't have no idea
Think you know me but there's more to see my love)

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinkin' you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs, is only
A part of the one I am, don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality and all I can be
Is in love with who I'm becoming

(Think you know me but there's more to see my love
You think you know but you don't have no idea)

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(I see you thinking)
You don't know me

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
And you think you know but you don't have no idea
Think you know me but there's more to see my love, my love)
