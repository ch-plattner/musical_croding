[Graham:]
There you come with your big, brown eyes and I'm so sure you got me mesmerized.
So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I.

[Ariana:]
I pick myself up, I pick myself up.
Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not.
My heart's still mine
I'm gonna take my time, but

[Both:]
Don't leave cause there's something about me and you.

You gotta stick around, stick around around.
Oh, You gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

[Graham:]
Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me.
I've always been the kind to think things out.
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about.
So I.

[Ariana:]
I make my mind up, I make my mind up.
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush.
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so.
Wait a minute

[Both:]
Till I got you all figured out.

You gotta stick around, stick around, around.
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

Take a look, take a breath.
Take a chance on everything I've said.
Take your heart. And take your time.
And maybe one day you'll be mine.
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. (Woah)
Yeah!

You gotta stick around, stick around, round.
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if it's.
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found.
Stick around, stick around, round.
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if it's.
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized.
Stick around.
