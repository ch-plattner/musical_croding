Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world (change the world)

You think you're so small
Like you're itty bitty.
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup'll get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like, like
It's just a waste of time,
Like, like, like

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world (change the world)
I said
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Sing it if you're with me
All you boys and all you girls (all you girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world (change the world)

Wish in a well, shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Gandhi, resurrect king
But if we put our heads together
We can do anything like
You don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show how much you care
Like give a wink, give a kiss
Like give a little happiness
Like like like

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world (change the world)
I said
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Sing it if you're with me
All you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world (change the world)

Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now!

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world (change the world)
I said
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Sing it if you're with me
All you boys and all you girls (all you girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
