On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhhh
I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie
