How soon do we forget
How we felt
Dealing with emotions
That never left
Playing with the hand that
We were dealt
In this game

Maybe I'm the sinner
And you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending
What we ain't
Why we pointing fingers
Anyway
When we're the same

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you,
For you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

[Big Sean:]
I guess time's wasting
Tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pick pockets
I guess to go the distance
We might need to pit stop it
Hold up
I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out
Started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much
'Cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones of ones
And we the oddest couple only human
Except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie it down just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah
You're, You're, You're, You're, mmm
I'll be saving my love for you, for you
You're, You're, You're, You're, mmm
I'll be saving my love for you, for you
