
Every day I'm grindin'
I don't even get a weekend
I've been livin' my life
In black and white, no sleeping
So tonight we're gonna flip it
Like in a New York minute
We're gonna hail a cab
And don't look back
Once we get in it

Lemme hear you say
Oh, oh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say
Oh, oh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain
We're gonna paint paint paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne
Let 'em know our names.
Screamin' so loud
They'll hear us in LA
Poppin' like pink champagne (eh, eh)
Poppin' like pink champagne (eh, eh)
Poppin' like pink champagne!

I make it pop like
I make it pop like
I make it pop like
Make it pop like
Make it pop like

We don't need no guest list
Everybody's invited
I'm saying, "Even if we can't get in we'll dance outside it!"
We're gonna make this bubble
We carbonate some trouble
When your life gets flat
Gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say
Oh, oh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say
Oh, oh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop like pink champagne,
In the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne
Let 'em know our names
Screamin' so loud,
They'll hear us in LA
Poppin' like pink champagne (eh, eh)
Poppin' like pink champagne (eh, eh)
Poppin' like pink champagne!

I make it pop like
I make it pop like
I make it pop like
Make it pop like
Make it pop like
Oh... Ooh... Ooh... Oh
P-p-p-p-pink!

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain!
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne!
Let 'em know our names!
Screaming so loud,
They'll hear us in LA (Whoa!)
Poppin' like pink champagne! (champagne!)
Poppin' like pink champagne! (no!)
Poppin' like pink champagne!

Pink champagne
In the purple rain!
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne!
Let 'em know our names!
Screaming so loud,
They'll hear us in LA (Whoa!)
Poppin' like pink champagne! (champagne!)
Poppin' like pink champagne! (no!)
Poppin' like pink champagne!
