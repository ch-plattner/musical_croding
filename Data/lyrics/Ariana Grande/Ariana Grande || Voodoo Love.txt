I'm gonna mix a potion up, make a special drink for you
Mm hm

Just a little sip and you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah
When I'm through
Uh huh

Now I'm not talkin' bout movies, don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me, and stay through thick and thin
I'm just gonna use some magic, might feel a little drunk
And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in the trunk

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting 
Three silver spoons of brandy wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and 
Baby, you'll be mine, with my voodoo love, aw yeah 
With my voodoo love, oh yeah

Boy I really knew you were the one the moment that I saw your eyes
Mm hm

Strong and wise and sweet and quiet, yeah,
You're just my type 
Mm hm

Now I'm not talkin' bout movies, don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me, and be my shiny prince
I'm just gonna use some magic, might feel a little high
But we'll be so enchanted, and you'll feel so alive 

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting 
Three silver spoons of brandy wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and 
Baby, you'll be mine, with my voodoo love, aw yeah 
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

I always get just what I want
And boy, I really want you now
So just say yes, can't second guess
The power of my voodoo love

My voodoo love

My voodoo love

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting 
Three silver spoons of brandy wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and 
Baby, you'll be mine, with my voodoo love, aw yeah 
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
