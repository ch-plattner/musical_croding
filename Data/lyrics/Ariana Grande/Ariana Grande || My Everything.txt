
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss him

To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm sayin' sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are
You are
You are my everything
You are
You are
You are my everything

I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you and I know sorry ain't the cure
If I cross your mind just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are...

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

You are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are my everything
