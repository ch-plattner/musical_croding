
Been round n' round in circles
Tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy
While chillin' with my friends

[Bridge:]
He's eyein' me
Sizin' me
Makes my body weak
He's bringin' out the freak in me
Only been a minute
Since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you
I fell this
Spark ignite

[Chorus: x2]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doin'
Livin' let it go (go, go)
Ridin' havn' good times and
No one has to know
He's eyen' me his eyes on me,
Makes my body weak
He's bringn' out the freak in me

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]

We got that jam, make them
Dance, make them lose their minds
(Ooohhh ummmm hmhm)
We got that jam, make them
Dance, make them lose their minds
(Oh yeah)
We got that jam, make them
Dance, make them lose their minds
(Uh huh)
We got that jam, make them
Dance, make them lose their minds
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus x4]
