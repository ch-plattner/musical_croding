
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you when there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinkin'
It's just too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
Baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
All the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
Oh, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
Oh, I can't

I can't be your only one
Oh, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
Oh, I can't

As I'm layin' down
With you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't sayin' that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
So baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
All the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
Oh, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
Oh, I can't

I can't be your only one
Oh, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
Oh, I can't

Only 1
Be your only 1
Only 1
