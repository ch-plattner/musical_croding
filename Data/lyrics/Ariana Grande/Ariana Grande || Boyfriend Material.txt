Now I've been looking for someone
Trying to find the right boy to wear on my arm
I must admit it
You simply fit it
You were like a cut above the rest, that's why you're winning (hey)

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you
My perfect type
And I never really thought my dreams would come true,
Until I laid eyes on you
'cause you know you are

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

You're my boyfriend material, boyfriend material (boy)

Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

That you and your perfect smile
Are both timeless and never going out of style
There's so many reasons you got it together
And I'm catching feelings, you make me look better (better)

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you
My perfect type
And I never really thought my dreams would come true,
Until I laid eyes on you
'cause you know you are

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

You're my boyfriend material, boyfriend material (boy)

Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

Oh, there ain't any other
It's all the little things that you do, make me wanna sing
There ain't any other
By the way you're talking to me, I can tell you've been listening
To everything

And maybe it's the butterflies I get every time I hear your ringtone (ringtone)
And maybe it's 'cause every single text, boy, I told myself you were the one

Boyfriend material

('cause I know you are) boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

You're my boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

You're my boyfriend material (material boy), boyfriend material (material boy)

Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know
