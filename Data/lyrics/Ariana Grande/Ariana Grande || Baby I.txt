Baby I got love for thee
So deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart

When I try to explain it
I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I must say baby, baby, baby

Baby I (ooh baby, oh baby, my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby, baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
(Baby, baby ohohohoh)

Baby I'm so down for you
No matter what you do
(Real talk) I'll be around
Baby I been feeling you
Before I even knew what feelings were about

When I try to explain it
I be sounding a lil crazy
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby, baby, baby

Baby I (ooh baby, oh baby, my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby, baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
(Baby, baby ohohohoh)

Straight up
You got me (all in)
How could I not be
I sure hope you know
If it's even possible

I love you more
Than word "love" can say it
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying...

Baby I (ooh baby, oh baby, my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby, baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
(Baby, baby ohohohoh)
