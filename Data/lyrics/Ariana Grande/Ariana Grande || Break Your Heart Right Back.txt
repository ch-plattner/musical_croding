
I shoulda saw it comin'
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby you were so good, so good
You had me goin' blind
You said it was your best friend, I'm guessing
I wasn't your type, hey

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back
Hey
All this time, I was blind running round telling everybody

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby
My baby
My baby loves me

You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he's gone, you're alone
Don't want you back

You're tellin' me you're sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Ain't doing this again
No

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back

Hey

All this time, I was blind running round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby
My baby
My baby loves me

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby
My baby
My baby loves me

Listen, you got man but your man ain't loyal
Don't understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw

Money too much
I step on stage and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, you know it's true 'cause
OK, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate
But I don't know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back (you can get with me)

And now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back

Hey

All this time, I was blind running around telling everybody
My baby loves me
