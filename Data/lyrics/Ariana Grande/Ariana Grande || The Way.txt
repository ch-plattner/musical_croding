I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
[One version:] I ain't a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)
[Another version:] I ain't a player (I just play her, I just play her)

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it (hey)
You got my heart, don't know how you did it (hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me (hey)

I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it)
The way you love me

Oh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And, honey, it ain't a question (q-question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it (hey)
You got my heart, don't know how you did it (hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me (hey)

I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it)
The way I love you

Uh, I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So you're sleeping in mine.
Come and watch a movie with me,
"American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that's groovy,
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you,
I'm not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you're an adventure
[One version:] So please let me come explore you
[Another version:] So let me come and explore you

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it (hey)
You got my heart, don't know how you did it (hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me (hey)

[One version:] I love the way (I love the way)
[Another version:] I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (I love the way)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it)

I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it)
The way I love you

The way I love you, (you), you, you, yeah, the way

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it
The way I love you.
