
What it will be it will be
I let it rain
Why was your whole life fulfilled

Ah, oh, ah, oh
Well I think it's getting dark out baby
No thanks I don't need your yellow umbrella ever right now
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Well you better get in the car
Could you move on
I can't wait for the skies to open up its heart

And let it rain
Let the sun shines down on me
I let it rain
Because you gotta deal with it anyway
I let it rain
What it will be it will be
I let it rain 
Why was your life so fulfilled

I let it rain (Imma let it rain, yeah)
Let the sun shines down on me
I let it rain
Because you gotta deal with it anyway
I let it rain (I let it rain)
What it will be it will be
I let it rain (oh let it rain)
Why was your whole life fulfilled
