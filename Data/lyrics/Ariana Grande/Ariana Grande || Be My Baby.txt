Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy

Be my, be my, be my
Be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby,
And drive me crazy

If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby, then you'll get your chance
The chance to love me

It's obvious I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do

'Cause babe I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me
Be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want
That you want babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I'll give you anything boy

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy

Be my, be my, be my
Be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby,
And drive me crazy

I'll give you all of my trust
If you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls
When you in the club

All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh on you
Night to the mo-oh-oh-oh-oh-orning

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy

Be my, be my, be my
Be my, be my baby

Be my, be my, be my baby,
And drive me crazy

I'll give you all of my trust
If you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls
When you in the club

All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only one you see

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy

Be my, be my, be my
Be my, be my baby

Be my, be my, be my baby,
And drive me crazy
