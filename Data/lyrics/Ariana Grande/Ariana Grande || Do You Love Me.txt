
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Watch me now

I can mash potato
I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana and your boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you something baby
I think I love you

Born to party
Born to rock
Big fat baby are we on top
Rolling in the cab
Hello bitch making hits like granddad
Busta move, get in the groove
Baby girl I'm into you
Show me what you can do

[Chorus:]
Tell me if it's meant to be
I'll give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk's cheap
Baby cash then dance with me
Say dance dance young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm the best baby that's on the hand
So, oh, oh,
Need your love
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me boy?
Oh, do you love me baby?
Now that I can da-a-ance
Watch me now

[Ariana:]
Cause I can mash potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana, and my boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell ya baby

[Sky Blu:]
Got the money, got the cash
On the dance floor I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky blu on the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it grande that's for sure
Her plus me you can add it up
You'll never get enough

[Ariana:]
Tell me if it's messy
I'll give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, toxy
Baby cash then come with me
Say dance dance young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm the best baby that's on the hand
So, oh, oh,
Baby boy I need to know
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me?
Oh, do you love me boy?
Now that I can da-a-ance

[Sky Blue:]

Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
