[Ariana Grande:]
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
Tú eres todo para mí
Te amo, I love it

[Mac Miller:]
Say, I'm thinkin' 'bout her, every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like "do she love me? do she love me not?"
I ain't a player I just...

[Ariana Grande:]
You give me that kind of something, want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want what I got, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you and I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Chorus:]
So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
The way I love you

[Verse:]
Oh, estoy loca, no no no no puedo ya dejarte de pensar
Y tú me llevas hasta el cielo (el cielo) con tu modo de hablar
Dame un beso, mi amor, y acariciame
Llevame al cielo, enamorame
Baby, yo quiero (estar contigo)
No te vayas, escucha lo que digo

[Chorus:]
So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
No se vivir, no

[Mac Miller:]
I'll make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me "American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that's groovy just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you I'm not gonna get bored of but baby, you an adventure so let me come and explore ya

[Chorus:]
So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
[Whistle tones]
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
The way I love you

The way I love you, you, you, yeah, the way
I love the way you make me feel (te amo, te amo)
I love the way you make me feel (te amo) no se vivir
The way I love you
