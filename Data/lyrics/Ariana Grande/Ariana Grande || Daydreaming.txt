You walked in,
Caught my attention,
I've never seen,
A man with so much dimension.

It's the way you walk,
The way you talk,
The way you make me feel inside,
It's in your smile,
It's in your eyes,
I don't wanna wait for tonight.

[Chorus:]
So I'm daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only you,
Got me daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only you.

For you,
For you,
For you,
For you.

Now I can't wait,
To hold you in my arms,
I know I was made for you,
I'm in love with all of your charm.

It's the way you walk,
The way you talk,
The way you make me feel inside,
It's in your smile,
It's in your eyes,
I don't wanna wait for tonight.

[Chorus:]
So I'm daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only you,
Got me daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only you.

And I want you,
Got to have you,
And I need you,
Like I never have
Ever before.

Oh I want you,
Oh I need you,
Got to have you,
Like I never have,
Ever before.

[Chorus:]
So I'm daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only,
You got me daydreaming,
With my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you,
You and only you.

For you,
For you.
