
I saw the cover and I judged the book.
I turned away without a second look,
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you.
I told myself I better run and hide.
I never noticed what was there inside,
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you,
And I can't stop myself from lovin'
Ev'ry itty bitty thing you do!

I didn't know where I was meant to be.
I figured no one would be there for me,
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you.

I never knew that you could understand,

But I looked up and you
reached out your hand,
And now, now, now
I see a brand new you!

I opened my eyes
And there's a great big world around.
I opened my eyes,
And just look, just look,
Look at what I found!

I opened my eyes
And there's a great big world around.
I opened my eyes...

And just look, just look,
Look at what I found!
