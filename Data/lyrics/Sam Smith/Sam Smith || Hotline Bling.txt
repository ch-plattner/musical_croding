You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Boy, you got me down, you got me stressed out

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we do not get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where we do not belong

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You don't need no one else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
