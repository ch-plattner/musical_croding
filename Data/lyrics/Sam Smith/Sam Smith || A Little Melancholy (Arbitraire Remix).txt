
I resign myself to a strange sensation,
of wanting somebody that I can't have.
I wish I could believe you, relieve my tension.
By telling something that I want to hear.
But you won't, will you? 

So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy. 

I resign myself to a day of frustration,
I can't hide the feelings that I've found.
Your sentimental touch fills my heart with elation.
Are we gonna kick this off the ground? 

So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy. 

I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't hide the feelings that I've found.
And you're not going to help are you?

So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy.
So I, might be a little melancholy.
