Oh baby, oh baby, oh we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you,
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy, we're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you,
Yeah we got nothing to lose

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give in to you

This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in our reattachment

Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

Oh baby, oh baby, oh, we both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together, we don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast,
Baby we should take it too far

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give in to you

This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in our reattachment

Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms
