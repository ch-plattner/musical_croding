It was a Monday night when you told me it was over, babe
And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
Don't say it was a good thing
Don't say it was the right thing to do
Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
When I'm the one playing the fool

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
The truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't wanna live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

You've been lightin' up my phone
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
Wanna make sure that I'm fine
But, baby, you're not on my mind, no more
I know it was the best thing for the both of us
Cause you're the one who looks like a fool

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
The truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't wanna live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

So let me restart

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't wanna live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
Hmmmm
