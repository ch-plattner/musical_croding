
Can I try for something, far from the eye
Can I speak without you, taming my mind
Industry could take the best of me
This industry could swallow all of me

Hold on Little Sailor, it will be alright 
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight
We got so close to the fame and the lights
Watching the stars tonight 
Little Sailor, let's sail tonight

Can I live inside a bubble, we call home 
Willing to anything, if I write a hit song
And I'll ride this tide, I'll put some makeup on 
And I'll shock the crowd, cause it will sell my song 

Hold on Little Sailor, it will be alright
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight 
We got so close to the fame and the lights
Watching the stars tonight
Little Sailor, let's sail tonight 

Six different managers, all filled with good intent 
They promised me the world, I ain't see nothing yet
Work hard to stay alive, work hard to pay the rent 
Still need my mom and dad, they must be heaven sent 

Hold on Little Sailor, it will be alright
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight 
We got so close to the fame and the lights 
Watching the stars tonight
Little Sailor, let's sail tonight
