
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
Your troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
Your troubles will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together,
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.

So have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
