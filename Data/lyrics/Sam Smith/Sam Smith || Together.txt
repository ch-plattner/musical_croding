
Kiss my lips and taste the Sauvignon
I wrap the vines around your thighs
I can see the kind of tip you're on
There's no confusion in your eyes

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Taking sips to push the moment on
But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time!

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Together
Together
Together

Ease our minds together [repeat]
