
Oh it's you, I know
You're the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above

Oh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from a dream
Tell me is it really love

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to fall but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is all bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak

Awake me, I'm shakin'
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love

How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to fall but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is all bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak
