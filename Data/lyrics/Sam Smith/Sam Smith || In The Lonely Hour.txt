
I need someone, that I'll look to,
In the lonely hour, that we all go through
To give me comfort, and love me through
In the lonely hour, I need you

I need you
I need you

I don't need diamonds, I don't need jewels
No amount of riches will cover up these blues
I don't need suggestions, on how to start anew
In the lonely hour, I need you

There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless without you

It's a lonesome point of view
When there's a wishful silence, in an empty room
These other voices, they don't cut through
In the lonely hour, I need you

I need you
And I need you

I need someone, that I'll look to,
In the lonely hour, I need you
I need you
