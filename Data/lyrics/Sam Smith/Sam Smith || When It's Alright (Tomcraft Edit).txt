When the night,
comes falling in your eyes.
And you rain your love of me.
I feel your heartbeat,
beating next to mine.
There's nothing more for me
let it beat...

When it's alright,
the feeling is so good.
And when it's alright,
I know my heart is understood.
And when it's alright,
There's nothing I can do,
but give my life to you.

When it's alright...
When it's alright...
When it's alright...

When it's alright,
the feeling is so good.
And when it's alright,
I know my heart is understood.
And when it's alright,
There's nothing I can do,
but give my life to you.

When the morning,
comes dawning in your eyes
and you rain your love of me.
While I am as helpless,
as a cloud up in the sky.
You push away my fears
and now you're here.

And when it's alright,
the feeling is so good.
And when it's alright,
I know my heart is understood.
And when it's alright,
There's nothing I can do,
but give my life to you.

When it's alright,
When it's alright...
When it's alright...
the feeling is so good.
And when it's alright...

And when it's alright,
the feeling is so good.
And when it's alright,
I know my heart is understood.
And when it's alright,
There's nothing I can do,
but give my life to you.

And when it's alright,
the feeling is so good.

I know my heart is understood.

There's nothing I can do,
but give my life to you.
