I had a dream I was mugged outside your house
I had a dream in a panic you came running out
For a moment you were sure I'd die on you
For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you were never strong

Too much of a good thing, won't be good for long.
Although you made my heart sing
To stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing, won't be good anymore.
Watch where I tread before I fall

We talk maybe twenty times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

Too much of a good thing, won't be good for long.
Although you made my heart sing
To stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing, won't be good anymore.
Watch where I tread before I fall

You refuse to see this, don't see it anymore
I have made the decision, not to answer your calls
Cos I put everything out there and I got 
Nothing at all

Too much of a good thing isn't good and you know
I watch where I walk before I fall
Before I fall
