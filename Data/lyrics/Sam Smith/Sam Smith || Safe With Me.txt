
If you ever need me
Just tell me and I'll be there
Cause I was built for you
Yes I was built to carry all your feelings

Cause I won't let them know
I won't let you go baby
I don't care what your past is
I don't need no answers
Just have faith in me

Don't you know your secret's safe with me
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
Don't you know your secret's safe with me
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep

No need to step back
Don't be scared, I got you, you know that
I'm here when you are sad
When all of your clouds turn black

Cause I won't let them know
I won't let you go baby
I don't care what your past is
I don't need no answers
Just have faith in me

Don't you know your secret's safe with me
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
Don't you know your secret's safe with me
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
