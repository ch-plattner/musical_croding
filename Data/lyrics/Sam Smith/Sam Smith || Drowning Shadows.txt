Running around chasing hearts
Chasing bodies to fix the parts
I don't know how I reached this place
So far from heaven, so far from grace

Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Do I, do I, do I, do I

Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more

The more I drink, the more I drown
If I'm not thinking, I won't get down
The more I rise above it all
The less I care about the fall

Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Do I, do I, do I, do I

Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more
Once more
Once more, ooh

Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more
