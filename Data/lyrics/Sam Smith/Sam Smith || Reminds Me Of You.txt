
I gotta get outta here,
This town's no longer fun
And I'm falling closer, falling closer,
Closer to the sun
I gotta get outta here,
Come kiss another face
'Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad
And I don't like the taste

You say it's over leaving me so far from sober
Now summer's cold and I lean on a stranger's shoulder
I walk the streets and hear heartbeats in city smoulder
Without a trace, I'm under

And God knows I've tried
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do,
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you

I gotta get outta here
'Cause you'll never want me back
You are moving on, moving on
And I'm stuck on the track
I gotta get outta here
Before I self-destruct
And I don't want, and I don't want
My heart to ever stop

I walk the streets and hear heartbeats in city smoulder
Without a trace, I'm under

And God knows I've tried
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do,
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you
[x2]

It only reminds me of you
