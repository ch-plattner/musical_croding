
I could never put my finger on the moment you turned to a statue,
I know you probably thought I noticed that in fact you had turned into stone.

Pray tell,
pray tell, 
Where did you go?

I've lost all faith,
now that you're gonna look me in the face,
So sick, sick of these lies,
you used to hide behind,
There's no love in your skies of rain,

I had always hoped that there would be more to you that guilt trips and raindrops,
every single time I think of you leaves me feelings alone, 

Farewell, farewell
it took me so long,

I've lost all faith
Now that you're gonna look me in the face
So sick sick of these lies
You used to hide behind
There's no love in your skies of rain 

And its all gone,
The connection between us,
We washed up
And there's drifting on beaches,
And you make no mend,

I have no faith
In a single word you say
So sick sick of these lies
You used to hide behind
There's no love in your skies of rain.
There's no love in your skies of rain.
