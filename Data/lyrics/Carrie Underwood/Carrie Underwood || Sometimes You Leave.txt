
All the raindrops
In the sky tonight
Can't compare with all the pain
And all the tears I've cried
But now I'm done

All the make believe
Locked in this picture frame
Is gonna stay behind
Along with all the burning rage
That's been tearing through my heart
It killing me slowly 
Every beat, I was falling apart

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

All this time I've spent
Staring at the door
I never had the strength
To pack my bags and leave before
But now I'm done
Lying to myself when it's clear
That you're not that one

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

When there's nothing left 
For me to leave behind
And you're already too far gone
To say goodbye

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

Sometimes you leave
