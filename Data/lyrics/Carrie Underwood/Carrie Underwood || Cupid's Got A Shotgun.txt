
Oh he gave up on arrows a long, long time ago
Turns out I'm too hard to hit so he put away his bow
I might just keep on runnin' from here to Timbuktu
'Cause he gave up on arrows and I ain't bulletproof

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me

He's sitting in that tree stand and his wings are camouflage
I'm dug down in my foxhole waiting on his next barrage
Must be open season, got a target on my back
Think he's throwing love grenades and I'm under attack

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me, yeah

[Bridge:]
Well he's got me in his sights, I've got a red dot on my chest
But little does he know I strapped on my Kevlar vest
I pulled out my Remington and I loaded up these shells
He's about to find out I'm a dang good shot myself

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me
Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun
But right now he's running from me, wooh
