
If you’re tired of your life and the way that you feel
Like a fish on a hook,
Like a bug on a dirty windshield, it’s ok
It’s time to take your chips and cash them all in
Cause it matters where you’re going
Not where you been, say hey
Goodbye yesterday

Well if life don’t go your way
Maybe it’s time to take a break,
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, uh, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket

So pack up your smile and your new flip flops
We’re headed to a heaven where the beat don’t stop
We'll dance the day and the night away
Grab yourself a gal,
Grab yourself a fella,
Grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
Goodbye yesterday

Whenever life don't go your way
Well, maybe it's time to take a nice long break

[Chorus:]
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket

Ooooh la la la la la la la la

So raise your hands in the air tonight
Raise your hands in the air tonight, whoa
Punch that clock and call it a day
Say adios to the minimum wage
Tell your bossman where he can stick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Life is so good, it’s sticky sweet
It’s a carnival cotton candy treat
Unwrap it like a lollipop, lick it, hey
We got a one way ticket

Ooo la la la la la la la
Woah-oh-oh.
Mmmmm mm mm mm mm mm mm ohhh
