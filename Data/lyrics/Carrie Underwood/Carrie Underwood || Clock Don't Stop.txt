
Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong, she's right
(No kiss goodnight)
Ring ring, telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry
(On the other end of the line)

And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away

Head's scared, heart broke
Burned from a band of gold
Rather just be alone
(Burns, just a bad joke)
Bang bang on a drum
You're not a setting sun
You ain't even close to done
(Run, baby, run run)

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right
Kiss me goodnight

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away)

Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
