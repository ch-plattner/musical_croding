If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
