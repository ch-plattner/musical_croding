While we're young and beautiful,
Kiss me like you mean it,
Treat me like I'm special,
Cover me with sweetness,
Cause a time will come,
When we're not so young, and beautiful,
While we're young and beautiful,
Living free and easy,
Here without a worry,
Dancing in our bare feet,
Cause when the summer's done,
We might not be so young, and beautiful.

[CHORUS:]
It's a crazy ride,
And baby, you and I,
Are keeping our sweet love alive,
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.

While we're young and beautiful,
We'll party down on Main street,
Wearing next to nothing,
Feeling every heart beat,
Having fun, while we're still young and beautiful.

[CHORUS:]
It's a crazy ride,
And baby, you and I,
Are keeping our sweet love alive,
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.

Beautiful,
Beautiful,
Young and beautiful,
Beautiful,
Beautiful,
Young and beautiful.

[CHORUS:]
It's a crazy ride,
And baby, you and I,
Are keeping our sweet love alive,
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.
Oh, so beautiful.

While we're young and beautiful,
Cover me with sweetness,
While we're young and beautiful,
Kiss me like you mean it,
Like you mean it,
Like you mean it,
Like you mean it,
Like you do,
Oh, yeah,
Oh so beautiful.
