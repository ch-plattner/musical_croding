
Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy
That's all I know
All I've done, all my life

'Cause throughout my history
I've only been with jerks
Who couldn't take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch
With us two on it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

You rescued me
Saved my life just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try

'Cause oh, the way you're kissing me
Makes it hard to breathe
But I still like it
Oh oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it

I believe that nothing lasts forever 
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

I've always been a quitter

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

I've always been a quitter
