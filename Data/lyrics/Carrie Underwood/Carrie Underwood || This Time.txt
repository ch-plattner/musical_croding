
Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
That's makin' me feel this way tonight
Maybe it's the words you left unsaid
Maybe it's the stardust in my hand

But I wanna tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
And I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
That's making all the pieces fit
Making it all make perfect sense

But I wanna tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
And I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

Goes by so fast
Can't get it back
There ain't no time like this time

Yeah, I just wanna tell ya, that my heart is bustin' at the seams
Yeah, and I can't wait another minute
Ohh, life is short
Love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby.
My little baby

Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
And there ain't no time
Ain't no time, ain't no time
Ain't no time like this time baby

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Yeah, yeah
