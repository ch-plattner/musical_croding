
Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me baby

[Chorus:]
And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
And I don't even know his last name

We left, the club, 'bout around 3 o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot, well it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh where did my manners go?

[Chorus:]
I don't even know his last name
Oh My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into "oh no, what have I done"
And I don't even know his last name

Here we go

Today, I woke up, thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear

There's just one little problem

[Chorus:]
I don't even know my last name
Oh My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into "oh no, what have I done"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done
What have I done
What have I done

Oh, what have I done
I don't even know my last name

Well it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Yea, Yeah, Yeah

I don't even know my last name
It started off "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah
