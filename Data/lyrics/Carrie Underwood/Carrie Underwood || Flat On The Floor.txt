
I'm flat on the floor
With my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh, lord
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet, when I'm already on my knees

Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me how
You think you gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep coming around
Creeping up my street
Oh boy, you can't bother me

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all blows through
I ain't gonna raise my body
'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign to you

Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Oh
Don't knock on my door
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done
