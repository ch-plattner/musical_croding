Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see

I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And Mama said you cried all the way home

You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love

Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am, yeah
Ooh
Ooh, yeah

All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me

Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me; yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am
