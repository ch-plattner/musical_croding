
What you're gonna do with the 36 cents
Sticky with coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk bench trying to keep warm
Do you call her over, hand her the change
Ask her her story, ask her her name
Or do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

What you're gonna do when you're watching TV
And an ad comes on, yeah, you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day, you could save a life
Do you call the number, reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam
Do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Don't listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

The world's so big, it can break your heart
And you just want to help, not sure where to start
So you close your eyes
And send up a prayer into the dark

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Don't listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
