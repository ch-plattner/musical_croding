
She remembers the nights he’d come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride

[Chorus:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then

[Chorus:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child,
Forever changed

Some days she’ll talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when she’s coming over
And why she hasn’t called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As time creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me
Watching her memories slip away a little more

[Outro:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever child,
Forever loved,
Forever changed.
