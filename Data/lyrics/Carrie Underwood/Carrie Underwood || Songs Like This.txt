Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this

Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
'Caught you on the couch with my best friend

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be 

Songs like this one
That tell the whole world
Just what a jerk you are

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be 

No, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
