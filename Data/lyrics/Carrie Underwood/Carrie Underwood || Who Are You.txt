
Who are you,
The one for who I’d really gladly suffer
Who are you,
The one I’d always love above another
You’re my world, you’re my hope, you’re all my dreams and all my heart

[Chorus:]
Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you,
that loves as deep as I do

Who are you,
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who are you,
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
You’re in my thoughts, you know my mind
You are my fate, you are my light

[Chorus:]
Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you,
that loves as deep as I do

[Bridge:]
You’re my savior, you’re my center
My beginning and my end
You’re the one I live for, you’re my angel
Who are you
You’re in my thoughts (in my thoughts)
You know my mind (you know my mind)
You are my fate, you are my light

[Outro:]
Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you,
that loves as deep as I do
Who are you
Who fell on me like fire
Who are you,
Who takes me through desire

Who are you,
The one I'd give my life to.
