Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and my Bob Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for nigh on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare

But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air

She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hand trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, I do not deny I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear

But there's nobody, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair), yeah yeah-yeah
Hey, yeah

Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We were live-or-die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

But the foreman of the jury told me "honey, don't you worry"
It's a Choctaw county affair, yeah
(Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair), yeah
How would you know cause you weren't there (Choctaw County affair)
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Mmm, yeah, yeah (Choctaw County affair)
