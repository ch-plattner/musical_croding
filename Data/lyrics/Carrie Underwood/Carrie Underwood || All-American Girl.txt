Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football, be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her

The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem
Tell me have you lost your mind?
Daddy said you'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy, you better tell her goodbye."

But now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said, "Honey, you ought to know...

A sweet, little, beautiful one just-a like you.
I want a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American..."

Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl

All-American girl
