
I need something strong tonight
I'm needing me a 100-proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you

Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're looking in my eyes, but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

Yeah, the grass ain't always greener
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design

Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in a sad place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love of the game
It's the get what you want and then you throw it away
It's the rush of the fall, not the land
It's the catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
