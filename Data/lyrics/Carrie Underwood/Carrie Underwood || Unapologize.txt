Last night, I was pouring out my heart
Like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss, I was a runaway train
Flying off the track to you

"I love you" came flooding out
Couldn't make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth
I felt like a fool when I lied and said I was sorry
But

I unapologize, I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard, 'cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight them back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

You know, people say a lot of things
That they don't really mean
And last night, I told a little white lie
Hoping you'd forget the scene

Where it felt like a movie under the porch light
Couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant, then I lied and said I was sorry

I unapologize, I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard, 'cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight them back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

Oh there's no time to be
Holding it all and trying to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Oh, I shouldn't have said I'm sorry

I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard, 'cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight them back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

'Cause you heard me right, yeah

I unapologize
