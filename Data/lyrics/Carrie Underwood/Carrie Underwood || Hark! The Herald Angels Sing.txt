
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in bethlehem
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the everlasting lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the virgin's womb

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our emmanuel!
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king

Hail the heaven-born 
Prince of peace
Hail the son of righteousness
Light and life to all he brings
Risen with healing in his wings

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in bethlehem

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king
