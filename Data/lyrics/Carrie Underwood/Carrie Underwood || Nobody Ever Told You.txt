Take off all the makeup, girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don’t be shy, don’t be scared
You don’t have to hide under there

Let’s throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

[Chorus:]
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
Yeah
La la la la la

Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like it knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
It doesn't care what's underneath

All hung up on the negative
Doesn’t have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

[Chorus:]
Nobody ever told you
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

Na na na na...

[Bridge:]
Free as a bird up on a wire
Just like a flower growing wild
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful

[Chorus:]
Nobody ever told you,
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

[Outro:]
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
You need to know
What nobody ever told you

Na na na na...

Oh, you're free as a bird up on a wire, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just like a flower growin' wild
Just like a flower growin' wild

Na na na na...
