I would bet my life, like I bet my heart
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You driving my heart crazy

I can't hold out, I can't hold back now
Like I've done before

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me

How do you do that, babe?
Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
First time in your arms, I knew

The way you held me, I knew that this could be
What I've been waiting to find

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm getting in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me

Every time you look at me
