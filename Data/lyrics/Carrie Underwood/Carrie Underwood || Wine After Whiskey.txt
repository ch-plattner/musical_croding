
Once upon a time our world was on fire and I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits, guess I had a lot to learn
Cause fire turns to embers, embers to ashes that blow away too soon

[Chorus:]
Now everything after you is like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me. It’s like having wine after whiskey

Looking back I guess it's really for the best, still you’re something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go. You’re a habit hard to break
I got used to being high and nothing that I try seems good enough right now

[Chorus:]
It’s all so watered down like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong
You can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me. It’s like having wine after whiskey

[Outro:]
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me.
It's like having wine
It’s like having wine after whiskey
