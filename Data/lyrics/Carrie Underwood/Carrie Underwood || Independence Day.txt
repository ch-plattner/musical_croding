[Originally performed by Martina McBride]

Well she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losing end
Some folks whispered,some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no was about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky the 4th of July
by the time that the fireman came
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain't saying it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
is a day of reckoning
let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day
