
Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you're thinkin' about

You'll see a good boy (you see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl (hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Hook:]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go-o-o, go-o-o-o...
Better listen to me
He's low, low, low...

Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairy tale ending, somebody to love

But he's really good at lying
Yeah, he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don't mean much
Hey good girl (hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away honey
You don't know where he's been

[Hook:]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go-o-o, go-o-o-o...
Yeah yeah yeah, he's low
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge:]
Oh, he's no good, girl
Why can't you see?
He'll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

[Hook/Outro:]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, he's no good

Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes
