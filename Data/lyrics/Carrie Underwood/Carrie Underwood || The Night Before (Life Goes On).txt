Sitting up on the roof
Sneaking a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon
And the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says
"I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"

[Chorus:]
Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much but its a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before
Life goes on

Oooh
A tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm he says
"Come on baby
Let's get outta here"
They take one last drive around town
And man it
Already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says
"Life ain't fair
And this growing up stuff man I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go"

[Chorus:]
Tomorrow shell be rolling down I
10 Baton Rouge
LSU
18 years in her rearview
Hes got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much but its a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before
Life goes on

Yeah that's what my momma told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yea theres nothing you can do
Theres nothing you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away

[Chorus:]
Tomorrow shell be rolling down I
10 Baton Rouge
LSU
18 years in her rear-view
Hes got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddies shop
It ain't much but its a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is
They don't have long
The night before
Life goes on
Yeah e yeah e yeah e yeah e yeahhhh
