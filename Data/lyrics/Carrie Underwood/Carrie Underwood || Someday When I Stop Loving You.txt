
One foot on the bus, 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leavin' this time
I thought about layin' down in it's path
Thinking that you might get off for that

I remember that night we laid in bed
Namin' all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow,
Somehow

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

Ooooooh
Oh, someday
Yeah, someday

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

Someday when I stop lovin' you
