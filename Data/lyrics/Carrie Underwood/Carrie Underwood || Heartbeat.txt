
I love it when we're at a party in a down-town crowd
Oh but I can hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background underneath the hardest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
