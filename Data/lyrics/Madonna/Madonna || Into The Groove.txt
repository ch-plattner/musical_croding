
And you can dance 
For inspiration 
Come on 
I'm waiting 

[Chorus:]
Get into the groove 
Boy you've got to prove 
Your love to me, yeah 
Get up on your feet, yeah 
Step to the beat 
Boy what will it be 

Music can be such a revelation 
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation 
We might be lovers if the rhythms right 
I hope this feeling never ends tonight 

[Bridge:]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free 
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see 
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself 
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else 

[Chorus]

Gonna get to know you in a special way 
This doesn't happen to me every day 
Don't try to hide it love wears no disguise 
I see the fire burning in your eyes 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Intermediate:]
Live out your fantasy here with me 
Just let the music set you free 
Touch my body, and move in time 
Now I now you're mine 

You've got to 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Intermediate]

Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine 
Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine 
You've got to 

[Chorus]

[Repeat and fade]
