I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What it is with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one...

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
Cause, you're the one...

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious, but I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray, pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious, but I feel such love
Makes me want to pray
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
Cause, you're the one...

I'm not religious, but I feel so moved
I'm not religious, makes me want to pray
I'm not religious, but I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray, pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious, but I feel such love
Makes me want to pray

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

Nothing fails
Nothing fails
No more fears
