Like the sun, like the light, like a plane
Like the storm, I'm born through everything
Like a bomb in the night, like a train
Thundering through the hills, let it rain

I'm a sinner, I like it that way
[2x]

All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
[2x]

Like the moon with a light of my own
Sift the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my hand in the fire
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire

I'm a sinner, I like it that way
[2x]

All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
[3x]

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, praise the Lord, I like it that way!

Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ hanging on the cross
Died for our sins, it's such a loss

Saint Christopher, find my way
I'll be coming home one day
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry
Let those poisoned arrows fly

Saint Anthony, lost and found
Thomas Aquinas, stand your ground
All the saints and Holy men
Catch me before I sin again

I'm a sinner, I like it that way
[2x]

You're a sinner, you're a sinner
you're a sinner, you'll like it that way

We're all sinners, we're all sinners
We're all sinners

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
