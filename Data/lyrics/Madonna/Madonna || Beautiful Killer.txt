
Dark eyes on a dangerous face you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place you are a (beautiful killer)
You don’t have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don’t understand
I don’t know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a (beautiful killer)
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

(Beautiful killer)

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

You’re a beautiful killer, but you’ll never be Alain Delon
