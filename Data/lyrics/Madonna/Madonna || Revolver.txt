My love's a revolver [x2]

Oops, I guess I shot ya, my finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it, click-click
I'm a sex pistol, my love should be illegal
Real deal, baby, I'm no counterfeit, click-click

[Bridge:]
Line 'em up, knock 'em down
If looks could kill, e-o-e-o
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up, knock 'em down
If looks could kill, e-o-e-o
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus:]
My love's a revolver, my sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy? [x2]
My love's a revolver, my sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy? [x2]

I let it bang, bang

You've been hit by a smooth criminal, a bad girl
I gotcha crying to your mama, saying I can't believe it
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right, I think I'm in love right

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]

I let it bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Spoken - Lil Wayne:]
Bang, the shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed, shoot again
I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr. Shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yes, I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shell
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill
And that vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel
My love is a revolver

[Chorus: x2]

I let it bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Lil Wayne:]
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die... happy?
