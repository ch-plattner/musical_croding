See which flavor you like and I'll have it for you
Come on in to my store, I've got candy galore
Don't pretend you're not hungry, I've seen it before
I've got turkish delight baby and so much more

Get up out of your seat (Your seat)
Come on up to the dance floor
I've got something so sweet (So sweet)
Come on up to the front door
I need plenty of heat (Heat)
Form a special confection
Just start moving your feet (Your feet)
Move on over to me

Come on in to my store
'Cause my sugar is sweet

Yo
Peace to the gummy lil' kid
Let me dance in the corner in the UK
And the USA, hah

All around the world
You know who it is
Yes her
It's the MA-DO-NN-A
You ready?
Let's go
Aye
