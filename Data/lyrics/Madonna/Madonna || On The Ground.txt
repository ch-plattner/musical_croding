
I live at the top of the hill
No one keeps me against my will
I don't need no save neighbourhood
I got to feel good, my own way

It's not like I don't have a choice
When you're alone, you make it all good
With you and me,you'll be saying it too
cause if something feels good doing your own way

You gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
And I never see your shit on the ground
And I never want to make a sound
More than I do now

I got away from the talk that's cheap
I don't care 'bout the company I keep
It feels good when it all feels good
I don't want to stand in your way

It's not like I don't have a choice
When you're alone, you make it all good
With you and me, you'll be saying it too
cause if something feels good doing your own way

You gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
And I never see your shit on the ground
And I never want to make a sound
More than I do now

You gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
And I never see your shit on the ground
And I never want to make a sound
More than I do now
