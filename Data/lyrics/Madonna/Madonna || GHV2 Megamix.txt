Hey Mr DJ
Put a record on

[Don't Tell Me:]
Tell me
Love isn't true
It's just something that we do (g, g, g, g, get up)
Tell Me
Everything I'm not but
Don't ever tell me to stop (g, g, g, g, get up)
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to tell
Don't you ever

[Erotica:]
Erotic, Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, Erotic
Put your hands all over my body 
Erotic, Erotic
Put your hand all over my body
Erotic, Erotic

[Secret:]
Something's coming
Something's coming
Something's coming over me 
My baby's got a secret (Mmm mmm)

[Frozen:]
Mmm mmm mmm
Give yourself to me
Mmm mmm mmm
You are the key

[What It Feels Like For A Girl:]
Do you know? (What, what)
What it feels like for a girl
Do you know?
What it feels like in this world for a girl?

[Take A Bow:]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You my love for granted
Why? Oh why?
The show is over
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

(You recognise my voice
It's Madonna
You can hear me
You can even see but you can't touch me
Ain't nothing like the real thing)

[Deeper And Deeper:]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
It gets sweeter and sweeter
The more that I know
The deeper I go 
(You've got to just let your body move to the...)
Music

[Music:]
Music
Makes the people
Come together
Music makes the bourgeoisie
And rebel

(Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you to acid rock)

[Ray Of Light:]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel 
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
