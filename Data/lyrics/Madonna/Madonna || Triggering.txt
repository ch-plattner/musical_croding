Dance, you're not fighting
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses

You're not dieing
Dance, you're not crying
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

Dance is a lovely friend
Dance to your heart's content
Dance and we don't pretend
Dance is your only friend

When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around

Dance, you're not taking
Dance, you're not hating
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

[Rap:]
I like it
A hip, a hip
A hippety hop
And you don't stop
You get on your feet
You do the hip hop
To a different beat
I know you don't stop
When you're on the street
You're not feeling down
And there's no one else around
You get on your feet
Until you hear the funky beat

When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around

When there's no one else around

Dance, you're not fighting
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses
You're not dieing
Dance, you're not crying
You're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

Triggering your senses
Triggering your
Dance...
