
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around, I need to think about it) [x2]
And one of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it) [x2]

Remembering the very first time
You caught that some ones' specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped

(I hope) I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around, I need to think about it) [x2]
And one of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it) [x2]

You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing

(I hope) I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around, I need to think about it) [x2]
And one of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it) [x2]

I remember when
You were the one
You were my friend
You gave me life
You were the sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder
So I can relate
I need to go back there
Before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groving [x4]

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around, I need to think about it) [x2]
And one of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it) [x2]

Yes it was incredible
There's no reason to pretend
Incredible

It's time to get your body grooving
It's time to get your hands up [continuing in the background]

It's incredible, unbelievable
It's incredible, unachievable
It's incredible, metaphysical
It's incredible

(Sex with you is...)
