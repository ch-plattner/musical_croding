
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine

There are too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make it shine
You make me feel
You make it shine, you make me feel

Love
Love
(I got you under my skin)
(I got you under my skin)

There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much distruction
What I want is a celebration

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make it shine
You make me feel
You make it shine, you make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin (Love)
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

My skin [repeated]

My skin...
