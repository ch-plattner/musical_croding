[Verse:]

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell, so

[Bridge:]

Here's my story (my story)
No risk no glory (no glory)
A little

[Chorus:]

Up and down and all around
It's all about survival

[verse]

Here's my question (my question)
Does your criticism (criticism)
Have you caught up in what you cannot see
Well if you give me respect
Then you'll know what to expect, a little

[chorus, repeat]
[verse]
[bridge]
[chorus, repeat 3 times]

(Up and down and all around)
I'll never be an angel
(Up and down and all around, survival)
(Up and down and all around)
I'll never be a saint it's true
(Up and down and all around, survival)
[repeat and fade]
