Don't sit there like some silly girl
If you wait too long you'll be too late
I'm not telling you something new
There ain't no time to lose (No time to lose)
It's time for you to celebrate

(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Get up, little girl
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, your world
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Your life, your choice
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, live it up

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

You don't have the luxury of time
You have got to say what's on your mind
Your head lost in the stars
You'll never go far (No time to lose)
It's time for you to read the signs

(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
I'll show, you how

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

Say what you like, do what you feel
You know exactly who you are
The time is right now
You got to decide
Stand in the back or be the star

(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now

I can't keep waiting for you
Anticipating that you've
No time to lose
I can't keep waiting for you

[Kanye West:]
Ah, it's the M part 2 I want you, I'm gonna do to you what I want to do to you
Your girlfriend she wants too, beautiful, just flew from Paris, voulez-vous
In a city that don't snooze, amongst the "who's who"s
And I use my ....
Everything that feel good gotta be so ah

Give me room now, I'm like a vampire on a full moon now
And i don't know about you now but I think I wanna try some new now
See what it do now
And when you sat down, ah, cause you was using your breathe now, ah
Cause you be doin' it to def now, she'd be doin' either F now, what's left now?

Mister West now, can you get any more fresh now? I think I just did just now
Talkin' my shit that sell, I'm a professional
I admit that flashin' lights so I live that
Fame is a drum, wanna hit that?
Cause I know exactly where to get that, did you get that?

(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat...)

On and on, the beat goes...
