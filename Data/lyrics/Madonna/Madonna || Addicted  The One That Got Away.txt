I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
Ya get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall
The drug that I craved
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
to the one that got away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm I'm addicted
to the one that got away
