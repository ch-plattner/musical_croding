
Talk about it people
If you dream and shout it
Was I nothing, feel the action
I can't get no satisfaction

With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

Tell your tales to someone else
Or written keep them to yourself
I've heard your stories
All before you're always walking out the door

With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

So get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

You would think I've had enough
Of all your kinks, it's just too much
I could have known when I first met you
We're trying so hard to forget 

Your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

So get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run
I Say
Get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

Your love on the run
You're oh no no just no fun
Just no fun on the run
Oh oh you're just no fun
