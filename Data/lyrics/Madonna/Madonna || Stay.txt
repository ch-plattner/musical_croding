
You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter
True love is hard to find
Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in and try to darken our days
I'll always want you to

[Chorus:]

Stay, stay darling [repeat 3 times]

You saw through my lies and deception
Yeah I was losing my way
You, you gave my life some direction
And now I'm ready to say
I know there's bound to be some hard times ahead
I'd be a fool to believe
But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to leave

[chorus]

[Intermediate:]

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
Ture love is so hard to find

Don't be afraid
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I know that I can make you love me
Love me, love, love, love, love me, love me

[intermediate]

I'll always want you to stay

[chorus]

And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scoodooly be bop

You know you've got to stay
I think about you night and day
You know you've got to stay
I can make you love me
Love me, love me, love me...
