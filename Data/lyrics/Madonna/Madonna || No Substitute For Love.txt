
I traded fame for love without a second thought
It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for, wanted it so badly
Went running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now I find I changed my mind
I found a new religion

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

I travelled 'round the world, looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms, feeling so alone
I had so many lovers who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt fulfilled
And now I find I changed my mind
I found a new religion

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love

I've had a change of heart
I'll make a brand new start
No famous faces, far off places, trinkets I can't buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger, drug that I can't try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal, laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land, fire that I can't spark

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
Substitute for love

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
No substitute for love
