
Now I can tell you about success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile
Let it will be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be

Now I can tell you about the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down

Let it will be
Oh let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be

Now I can see things for what they really are
I guess I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return
Just watch me burn

Let it will be
Just let it be
Oh let it be

Let it will be (just let it be)
Just let it be (Let it will be)
Oh let it be (Got to let it be)
Oh let it be (Won't you let it be)

Now I can tell you
The place that I belong
It won't last long
The lights they will turn down

Oh let it be [repeat]

Won't you let it be
You got to let it be
Anyone can see
Let it will be

Just watch me burn
Oh let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be

Won't you let it be (Just let it be)
Oh let it be (Let it will be)
Just let it be (got to let it be)
Won't you let it be (won't you let it be)
