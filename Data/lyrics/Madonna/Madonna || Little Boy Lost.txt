
He runs through the street
Cause his house's falling down
And his eyes are burning as they touch the ground
The baseball cap won't hide the pain
There's no one here today
He runs through a house
And he looks for food
He feels so bad
But he knows he's good
He lays down on the kitchenfloor
He ain't hungry no more
Little boy lost
In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand
Little boy say
Why do you cry
And how much will you pay
To know why
Sometimes at night he wets his bed
As you stay playing tricks inside his head
He waits so cold
For a longer life
There's no one here tonight
Little boy lost
In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand
Little boy say
Why do you cry
And how much will you pay
To know why
