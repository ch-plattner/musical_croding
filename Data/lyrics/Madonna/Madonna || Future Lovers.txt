
I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans
Come with me

In the evidence of its brilliance [repeat]

In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try

[Chorus]
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try

Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide
Love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance [repeat]

Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine
For eternity
In a world that's free

Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on
To a dream that's gone

I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try

In the evidence of its brilliance [repeat]

There's no love like the future love

Come with me

[Chorus]

In the evidence of its brilliance
[repeat]
