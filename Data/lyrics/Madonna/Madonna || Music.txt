
Hey, Mr DJ put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

Do you like to Boogie woogie, do you like to Boogie woogie,
do you like to Boogie woogie, do you like my dancing?

Hey Mr. DJ put a record on I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop, it's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music
Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie woogie
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
But she's everything I'm in got to have it everyday

Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Hey Mr. DJ

Do you like to
Boogie woogie, do you like to
Boogie woogie, do you like to
Boogie woogie, do you like my dancing

Hey Mr. DJ put a record on I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop, it's gonna drive me crazy

Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel
