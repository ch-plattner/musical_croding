
Mmmm, mmmm
Say good-bye to not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye to not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus (first time substitute "strength" for "love" and "saved" for "changed"):]

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember

Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

[chorus]

I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned to let go, I travel in stillness
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
Mmmmm... (I'll remember)
Mmmmm...

[chorus]
(I'll remember)

No I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
[repeat 3 times, substituting "And" for "Now" the second and third times]
