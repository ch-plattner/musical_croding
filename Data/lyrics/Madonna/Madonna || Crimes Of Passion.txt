[Chorus:]

Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction

Don't play dumb with me, I know you know the score
I wait impatiently, tonight I'm yours
Show you what it's like to have your cake and eat it too
I think you'll like what I'm gonna do, oh

[chorus]

I'm not the type of girl who likes to settle down
Some people say that I just want to fool around
Once I get a taste I want more
I'm like a baby in a candy store, oh

[chorus]

[Intermediate:]

There's no reason to feel guilty
It's too late now, what's done is done
If you can keep it a secret darlin'
We can have some fun

I always want the things that I can't get
I don't believe in rules that you can't bend
Even when you say you've got someone at home
Tell her tonight that she's on her own

[intermediate]
Oh

[chorus]

Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me such a sweet reaction (so much satisfaction)
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me so much satisfaction
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me such a sweet reaction (so much satisfaction)
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me so much satisfaction
