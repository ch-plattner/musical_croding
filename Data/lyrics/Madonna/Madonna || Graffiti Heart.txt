Then it would be illegal
If scars could go away 
What would your body say
Don't ever hide your feelings

Ohh don't ever try to take my freedom
Ohh your imperfections, this world needs them

What do you got, show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died fighting
So you can do it as well

Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart

Frida showed her feelings
Painting from the ceiling 
Back in the beginning 
Nothing's what it seems 
She painted all her dreams 
She made her own reality

Ohh don't ever try to take my freedom
Ohh your imperfections, this world needs them

What do you got, show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died fighting
So you can do it as well

Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart

We can break down and take down
But they can't destroy our history
This wall, it must fall
To make room for our masterpiece

Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart

If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all
Then it would be illegal
