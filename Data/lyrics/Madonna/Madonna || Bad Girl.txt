Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

[Bridge (first time without first "I"):]

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't wanna feel blue

[Chorus1:]

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

[Chorus2:]

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

[bridge]
[chorus1]
[chorus2]
This way

[bridge]
[chorus1, repeat]
I'm not happy this way
[chorus1]
[chorus2, substituting "someone else's" for "some kind stranger's"]
This way

I'm not happy this way
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
