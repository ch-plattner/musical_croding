American dream
American life
American dream

Do I have to change my name?
Am I going to be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I going to be a star?

I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shot-te'
It goes into my body and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my mini cooper 
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo, they tell me I'm a trooper and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties 
So, I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a christian and I'm not a jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems...

American life
I live the American dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are the not just a dream
American life
I live the American dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

Do I have to change my name?
Am I going to be a star?

Am I going to be a star? (American dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I going to be a star? (American dream)
