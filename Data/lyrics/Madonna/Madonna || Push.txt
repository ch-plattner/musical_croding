You push me
To go the extra mile
You push me
When it's difficult to smile
You push me
A better version of myself
You push me
Only you and no one else

You push me
To see the other point of view
You push me
When there's nothing else to do
You push me
When I think I know it all
You push me
When I stumble and I fall

Keep on pushing like nobody

[Chorus]
Every race I win
Every mood I'm in
Everthing I do
I owe it all to you
Every move I make
Every step I take
Everything I do
It's all because you push me

You push me
When I don't appreciate
You push me
Not to lie and not to hate
You push me
When I want it all to end
You push me
When I really need a friend

You push me
All I wanna do is cry
You push me
When it's hard for me to try
You push me
When I do it for myself
You push me
Only you and no one else

Keep on pushing like nobody

[Chorus]

You push me

Keep on pushing like nobody

[Chorus]

To go the extra mile
When it's difficult to smile
A better version of myself
Only you and only you and only you
To see the other point of view
When there's nothing else to do
When I think I know it all
Only you and only you and only you
