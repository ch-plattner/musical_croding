
I miss your brain
The way you think
But I don't miss 
The way you used to drink 

I miss our talks
The Universal Law
You had a way 
Of seeing through my thoughts

It's so confusing I thought i met my match
An intellectual would telling for a catch
You always said we be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for that call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regret 
Cuz I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend 
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the country side where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it

You wrote me poetry
You had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regrets
Cuz I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
Cuz I survived all biggest tests
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that had to end
I lost my very best friend (lost my very best friend)
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend

I put away your letter
Saved the best ones that I have
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
Cuz I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
Cuz I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end
