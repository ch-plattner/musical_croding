
If you wanna talk to me, that's exactly what you're gonna have to do: talk to me!

When we first met you had a lot to give
I said I was in your shoes, i could not lose
But now, baby, I just don't know
I'm so confused, all this abuse

It's strange, 'cause you don't act like my friend
And I can't pretend I don't want this to end
My daddy said
My mama said
My sisters say
My mind says

Lose your attitude (ring my bell) say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell) something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)

(you, you, you) you, you really have some nerve
Playing stupid games, calling me names
And now you wanna eat those words
Once you attack you can't take it back

It's strange, I guess off your high horse you're fallin'
You're callin' and callin', I don't understand at all?
My daddy said
My mama said
My sisters say
My mind says

Lose your attitude (ring my bell) say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell) something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)

(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) my bell (ring my bell)

(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) my bell (ring my bell)

When you look in the mirror, darlin', what you see
Life's not the same until you're in pain
I know it's just no good to hate
I don't want to say it might be too late for you

I'm not answering your phone call
Babe, if you want more you come to my front door
My daddy said
My mama said
My sisters say
My mind says

Lose your attitude (ring my bell) say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell) something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell) then you can (ring my bell)

(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) my bell (ring my bell)

(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) you can't
(ring my - ring my bell) my bell (ring my bell)

(ring my bell, ring my bell, ring my bell, ring my bell)
(ring my bell, ring my bell, ring my bell, ring my bell)
