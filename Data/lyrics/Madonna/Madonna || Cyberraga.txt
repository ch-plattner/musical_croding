
May all be well with mankind
May the leaders of the earth in every way
Protect the earth by keeping to the right path

May there always be goodness
For those who know the earth to be sacred
May all the world be happy

Whatever I do
Whether my body, mind, sense, organs, intellect, self
Or out of natural inclination
I make it all an offering to
The all-pervading supreme being
