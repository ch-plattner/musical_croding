I'm under your spell
Fold me in, took me down with your poisonous touch 
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with the fever that I love so much

You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist, put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil, watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart 
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart 
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away 

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet, but oh so devine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart 
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart 
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted 
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted 
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted to the one that got away 

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away
