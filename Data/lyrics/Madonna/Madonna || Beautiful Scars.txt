Just take me with all my stupid flaws
Changing me's like shooting in the dark
Patience please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to be-lieve me I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it 'cos I'll never be as perfect as you want

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me, although I'm incomplete
My im-per-fections make me unique that's my belief

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

Never say never
Anything is possible
Always been a rebel
Overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect
But I can give you forever, oh ohoh oh oh

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
(You got to love me, you got to love me...)
(You got to love me, you got to love me...)
