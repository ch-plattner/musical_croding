No ones telling you how to live your life
But it's a set up, until you're fed up
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

I've had so many lives since I was a child
And I realize how many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly, closer to the sky

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find someone to admire

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm going to try to improve my life

I don't want no lies
I don't watch t.v.
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch t.v.
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch t.v.
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch t.v.
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

No ones telling you how to live your life
But it's a set up, until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
Well why should I care what the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger give me a social disease

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody, Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch t.v.)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch t.v.)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)

Nobody, Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch t.v.)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)

I don't want no lies
I don't watch t.v.
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine
