
What you're gonna do when your love is gone 
Who you're gonna play when the game has ended 
Where you're gonna go when the bird has flown 
How you're gonna play when you're all alone 

Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

What you're gonna do when you're on your own 
What you're gonna have when you've got no place to call your own 
What you're gonna try when your cover's blown 
How you're gonna fly when your wings are broken 

Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love 

Don't let it get you down 
Keep the fighting spirit and turn your head around 
Don't let it take you in 
Keep the fighting spirit and you'll begin again 

Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
