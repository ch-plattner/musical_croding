Just repeat history

I looked all around the world
Nobody has it better than we do, uh, huh
One thing I don't understand
Why don't we help more people 'cause we can, uh, huh

Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history

Why are we separated
Defined by our greed and hatred?
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

How many tragedies
Will we see before we come together? Uh, huh
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better, uh, huh

I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat history

Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history
Just repeat history

Why are we separated?
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Why aren't we all together?

I'm so sick and tired of fighting

I have a dream

Just repeat history
Just repeat history
