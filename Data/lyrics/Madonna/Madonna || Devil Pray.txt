Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
'Til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
Then we could travel altogether
And make the devil pray

Oooh save my, oooh save my, oooh save my
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my, oooh save my, oooh save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Oooh save my, oooh save my, oooh save my
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my, oooh save my, oooh save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary can't you help me
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away

The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
Then we could travel altogether
And make the devil pray

Oooh sing hallelujah
Oooh save my soul
Oooh the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said
Oooh sing hallelujah
Oooh save my soul
Oooh the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said
Oooh sing hallelujah
Oooh save my soul (sing hallelujah)
Oooh the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
