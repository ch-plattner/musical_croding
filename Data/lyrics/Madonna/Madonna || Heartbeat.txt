On any given night
Catch me on the floor
Working up a sweat
That's what music's for
I'd rather not explain
For me, it's just usual

(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
Once I get going I am gone
(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
I'll keep it going all night long

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on

This complicated life
I try to do my best
I always tell myself
It's all just a test
For me it's an escape
Cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

(And I can't pretend, it should never end, let the music play, are you watching now?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(You can really pop it now, it should never end, let the music play, cause I'm here to stay)
I'll keep on dancing through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on

See my booty get down, right
See my booty get down, right
See my booty get down, right
See my booty get down, right

Uh uh, get down
Uh uh, get down

See my booty get down, right

You probably think I'm crazy
I don't want you to save me
Don't mean to disappoint you
I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes
Then you would feel my heartbeat too

(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
I can keep on going through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see?
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on

M-dollah, M-dollah...
