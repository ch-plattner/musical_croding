Its not so bad
There's still a chance for us

Hey, you, just be yourself
Don't be so shy
There's reasons why its hard

Keep it together, you'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey, you

Hey, you, open your heart
Its not so strange
You've got to change this time

Hey, you, remember this
None of its real including the way you feel

Keep it together, you'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey, you

Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, little brother

Hey, you, save yourself
Don't rely on anyone else

First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
Then you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else

But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
Then you can change someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first

Hey, you, there on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense

Hey, you, first love yourself
And if you cant
Try to love someone else

Keep it together, you'll make it alright
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey you

First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
Then you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else

But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
Then you can change someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first
