
Bitch!
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
You'll be sorry

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have what she wants
In a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
Then you turn your back and she's off with your guy

[Chorus:]

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

And gets away with it
Not this time

Here she comes, acting all dejected
So you give advice and she gives you her poison
Here she comes, little miss black widow
First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

[chorus]

Thief of hearts, bitch

[Intermediate:]

You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
[repeat]

You can't take it, not what's mine
I could break you, 'cause what you've done is a crime, bitch
He's mine

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have his child
Well anybody can do it
Here she comes, little susie ho-maker
Thinks she'll get respect if she screws it

[chorus]

Thief of hearts, bitch

[intermediate]

You can't take it, not what's mine
You'll be sorry, 'cause what you've done is a crime

She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, what she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine
She's a thief, thief
She's a thief, thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
Stop bitch
Now sit your ass down
