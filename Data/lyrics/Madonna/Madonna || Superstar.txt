You're like Brando on the silver screen
You're my hero in a mythical dream
You are perfect just the way that you are
You're Mike Jordan, you're my superstar

Oooh la la, you're my superstar
Oooh la la, love the way that you are
Oooh la la, you're my superstar
Oooh la la, that's what you are

I'm your biggest fan, it's true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the keys to my car
I'll play you a song on my guitar

Oooh la la, you're my superstar
Oooh la la, love the way that you are
Oooh la la, you're my superstar
Oooh la la, that's what you are

You’re my gangster
You’re like Al Capone
You’re like Ceasar
Stepping onto the throne
You’re Abe Lincoln
Cuz you fight for what’s right
You’re my angel
Bringing peace to my life

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

I’m your biggest fan, it’s true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the password to my phone
I’ll give you a massage when you get home

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

You're Bruce Lee with the way that you move
You're Travolta getting into your groove
You're James Dean driving in your fast car
You're a hot track, you're my suppa duppa star

You're my superstar
You're my superstar (ooh la la, ooh la la)
You're my superstar (ooh la la, ooh ooh ooh ooh la la)

I’m your biggest fan, it’s true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the keys to my car
I'll play you a song on my guitar

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, you're my supersuperstar
