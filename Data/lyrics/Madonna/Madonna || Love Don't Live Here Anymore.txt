[Chorus:]

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

[chorus]

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

[chorus]

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love

[chorus]
