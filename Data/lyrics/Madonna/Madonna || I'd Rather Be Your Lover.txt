[Chorus:]

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you

[Bridge:]

And all that I know (all that I know)
Is I just don't understand (just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

[chorus]

Sometimes I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?

[bridge]
[chorus]

Are you surprised?

[Spoken:]
Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
I, I betcha I, I give you whatch-ya need
Take a walk within me, venture through the dark sea
Can't you see, I need you beside me
Don't you see, I want you to want me

[bridge]
[chorus, repeat]
Are you surprised?
[chorus]
Are you surprised? Are you?
