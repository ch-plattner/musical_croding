
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
We're scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together
I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright
Tonight

We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane
Together
We're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright

Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...

Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...

I don't want to breathe
Air that you're not breathing
I don't want to hear
If your heart's not beating
If you hurt then I
Want to be the one that's bleeding
Want to be the one that's bleeding

Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...

Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Everything's gonna...
Everything's gonna...
