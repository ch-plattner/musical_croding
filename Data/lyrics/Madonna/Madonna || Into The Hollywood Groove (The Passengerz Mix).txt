Unh
Aww, who that be?
Misdameaner on the M-I-C!

[Madonna]

Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They want to make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you and it looks good?

[Missy Elliott]

Misdameaner on the M-I-C
I got the fresh kicks, thick hips, best believe
Me and Madonna about to hurt them like a tag team
You're going to love us in our new GAP jeans
Walk by, people ask, where'd you get those jeans?
On fire, call emergency
G-A capital P, you should know how we...

[Madonna]
Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be

Going to get to know you in that special way
This doesn't happen to me everyday
Don't try to hide it
Love knows no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be

[Missy Elliott]

Let me go and do my thing
I bring it hard on the track if you know what I mean
Hollywood and New York, Madonna is the queen
And misdameanor say...

[Madonna]

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
You got to...

Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me
Get up on your feet
Let's step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

(You got to...)
Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be
