Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

I don't want nobody else
All the others look the same
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
And the word is spinning
Spinning baby out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Kiss me
Kiss me

I like to singy singy singy
Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy
I like to rhumba rhumba rhumba
Dance to a samba samba samba

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take
Take me where my heart wants to go
