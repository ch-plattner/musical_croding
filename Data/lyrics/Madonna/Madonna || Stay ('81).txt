[Verse:]

Am I just dreaming or did you walk through my door?
Do you still feel the same way that you did before?
Did you come to bring me sorrow?
Like all those wasted days
Let's not think about tomorrow

You can stay

Am I just dreaming or did you say you have to go?
If you can't stay forever, I don't wanna know
There's no need to talk about it
The way things used to be
I'm not living here without you

[Chorus:]

Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'
Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'

You could stay, stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay, stay darlin'
[repeat]

No, no, can't let go
No, no, can't let go
No, no, can't let go

Am I just dreaming?

[verse]

You could stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'
Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'
[repeat]

You could stay, stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay, stay darlin'
[repeat and fade]
