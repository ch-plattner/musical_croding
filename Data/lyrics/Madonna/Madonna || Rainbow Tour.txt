[Peron:]
People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina

[Che:]
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
[Aide #1:]
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
[Aide #2:]
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
[Che:]
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard

[Aide #1:]
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
[Aide #2:]
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card

[Chorus:]

[Peron and Aides:]
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

[Peron:] Will Evita win through?
[Aides:] But the answer is yes

[Peron:]
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

[Che:]
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why

[Eva:]
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

[Italian admiral:]
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago

[Aide #2:]
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
[Che:]
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
[Aide #1:]
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye

[chorus]

[Peron:] Will Evita win through?
[Aides:] But the answer is ...
[Che:] A qualified
[Aides:] Yes

[Che:]
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

[Che:]
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

[Aide #1:]
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

[Che:]
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required

[chorus]

[Aide #2:] Would Evita win through?
[Aide #1:] And the answer is
[Aide #2:] Yes
[Che:] And no
[Aides:] And yes
[Che:] And no
[Aides:] And yes
[Che:] No

[chorus]

[Aides:] Would Evita win through? But the answer is
[Aide #2:] Yes
[Aide #1:] Yes
[Aide #2:] Yes
