Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to, 'cause I'm following you.
My feet might be falling out of rhythm,
Don't know what I'm doing with them, but I know I'm following you.

Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but who's counting?
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.

[Spoken:] Take it away, boys.

On the run.
Be the one.
On the run.

[Spoken:]

Yeah.
(Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy)
(Come here Tracy, this is Sam, what are you doing up there?)
I'll tell ya.
(Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy)
(Do you read me, Tracy?)
(To tell you the truth Tracy, I don't know.)
Find out.

An unexamined life is not worth living.
[Spoken:] Come over here!
Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to, 'cause I'm following you.

Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.
But who's counting?

[Spoken:]

(Ten million, twenty million, thirty million)
What about Dick Tracy?
(Forty million)
Dick, that's an interesting name.
(Fifty million)

Dick Dick (Sixty million) Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick, (Seventy million), Dick,
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick (Eighty million), Dick Dick Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick
(Ninety million.)
Dick.

[Spoken:] My bottom hurts just thinking about it.

Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but who's counting?
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.

[Spoken:] Would you knock it off please? Thank you.
