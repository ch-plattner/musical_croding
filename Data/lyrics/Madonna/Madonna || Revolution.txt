
I’m a poet, you’re a thief
Welcome to my side of the street
Drank my wine, freed the beast
We’re all fighters in the revolution

It’s calling out our names
It’s a constitution
And our struggles are all the same
Who can you blame
The revolution

It’s our job, we have no choice
Change the system, use your voice
Don’t look back, no regrets
Strap your boots on, it’s a revolution

And it’s calling out your names
It's the constitution
Our struggles are all the same
Who can you blame
The revolution

Ain’t no stopping us today
Better watch out, you’re in the way
We’re the children of the future
Haven’t you heard about the revolution

And it’s calling out your names
In the constitution
And our struggles are all the same
Who can you blame
The revolution

Ain’t no stopping us today
Better watch out, you’re in the way
We’re the children of the future
Haven’t you heard about the revolution
