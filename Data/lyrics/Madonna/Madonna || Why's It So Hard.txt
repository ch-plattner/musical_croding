
Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love
[repeat]

What do I have to do to be accepted
What do I have to say
What do I have to do to be respected
How do I have to play
What do I have to look like to feel I'm equal
Where do I have to go
What club do I have to join to prove I'm worthy
Who do I have to know

[Chorus:]

I'm telling you brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to challenge the system
Without living in pain
Brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to accept that we're different
Before it's too late [first time only]
Why's it so damn hard [all other times]

What do I have to learn to know what's right for me
What do I have to know
What am I going to do when I feel righteous
Where do I have to go
Who should get to say what I believe in
Who should have the right
What am I going to do with all this anger
Why do I have to fight

[chorus]

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, share your love
[repeat twice]

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, show your sister how

Brothers, sisters, what do I have to say
Brothers, sisters, how do I have to play
Brothers, sisters, who should have the right
Brothers, sisters, why do I have to fight

Why's it so hard to love one another
Love your sister, love your brother
[repeat]

Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love

[chorus]

Sing your love
Share your love
[repeat 3 times]

Love your brother now
Show your sister how
Love your brother now
Show your sister
[repeat]
