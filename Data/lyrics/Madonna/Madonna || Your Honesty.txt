It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know you drive me crazy

You are one of a kind and I want you to remain that way
Pulling me closer to you
You have a special quality
You're bringing out the best in me
You have a special quality
You are pulling me closer to you

It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know it just gets better

This is the way it should be
You know the truth will set you free, so free
Pulling me closer to you

Où que ce soit pour toujours
Dis moi la vérité
Oui je sais pour toujours
