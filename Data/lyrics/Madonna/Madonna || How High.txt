
How high are the stakes
How much fortune can you make
[repeat]

It's funny
I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about
I did it
Just about everything
To see my name in lights

Was it all worth it
And how did I earn it
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve it

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes
How much fortune can you make
Does this get any better
Should I carry on
Will it matter when I'm gone
Will any of this matter

It's funny
How everybody mentions my name
But they're never really nice
I took it
Just about everything
Except my own advice

Was it all worth it
And how did I earn it
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve it

[Chorus]

(nothing lasts forever)
(doesn't make a difference)

How high
Doesn't make a difference
Nothing lasts forever
Should I
Will it matter when I'm gone
Will any of this matter

How high are the stakes
How much fortune can you make
Should I carry on
Will it matter when I'm gone

[Chorus X2]
