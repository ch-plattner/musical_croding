
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang Bang
Bang Bang

I thought you were good
But you painted me bad
Compared to the others
You're the best thing I had

Bang Bang, shot you dead
Bang Bang, shot you dead

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang Bang, shot you dead
Bang Bang, shot you dead in the head

Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang Bang, shot you dead
Bang Bang, shot you dead

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang Bang, shot you dead
Bang Bang, shot you dead

Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang Bang, shot you dead in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

And then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin
You were driving my hearse

Bang Bang, shot you dead
Bang Bang, in the head

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all of my jack?

Bang Bang, shot you dead, in the head

Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang Bang, shot you dead, in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

You had to die for me baby

You had to die for me baby
You had to die for me baby
How could I move on with my life
If you didn't die for me baby
If you didn't die for me baby
I need you to die for me baby

Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead, and I have no regrets
He deserved it

And I'm going straight to hell
And I've got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
Cause I wanna see him die
Over and over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch
