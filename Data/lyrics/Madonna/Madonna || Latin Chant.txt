[Choir:]

Respice, quaesumus, Domine
Famulam tuam Evita
In infirmitate
Et animam refove, quam creasti
Ut castigationibus emendata
Se tua sentiat medicina salvatam
Per Christum, Dominuum
Qui vivit et regnat
Per omnia saecula saeculorum
Amen
Look with favor, we beseech Thee, Oh Lord 
Upon Thy handmaid Evita 
In her weakness 
And refresh the soul which Thou hast created 
That being corrected by Thy chastisement 
She may find herself cured by Thy healing 
Through Christ, Our Lord 
Who lives and reigns 
Forever and ever 
Amen 

[Che:]
She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, "Eva Peron"
But that's all gone now
