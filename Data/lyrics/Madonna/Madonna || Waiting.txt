
Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

[Bridge:]

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

[Chorus (substituting "This" for "I'm" in 2nd line):]

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[repeat chorus]

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

[chorus]
[chorus, substituting "Just" for "I'm" in 2nd line]

[Intermediate:]

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

[bridge]

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
[repeat]

[intermediate]

[chorus, repeat]

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
[repeat]

[chorus]

Break my heart
Don't break my heart
[repeat twice]

Break my heart
You broke my heart [repeat twice]

Uh, next time you want pussy, huh
Just look in the mirror baby
