[Verse 1]
You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger hunting your prey
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle exotic apparel

[Pre-Hook]
I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

[Hook]
Baby I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up, incase you bite
Like an Animal animal
Animal animal
Baby I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave
Animal animal
Animal animal
Baby I'm gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal animal
An animal animal
I'm gonna tie you up incase you bite
I'm an animal animal
An animal animal

I don't mean to blame you I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
An animal animal
I don't mean to blame you I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
An animal animal

[Verse 2]
You're a hunter feel your way
I'll do whatever you say
Hold me down and take control (mess up my hair all crazy sexual)
Do it like an animal (hot in the jungle exotic apparel)

[Pre-Hook]
I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

[Hook]
Baby I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up, incase you bite
Like an Animal animal
Animal animal
Baby I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave
Animal animal
Animal animal
Baby I'm gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal animal
An animal animal
I'm gonna tie you up incase you bite
I'm an animal animal
An animal animal

I don't mean to blame you I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
An animal animal
I don't mean to blame you I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
An animal animal

[Pre-Hook]
I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

[Hook]
Baby I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up, incase you bite
Like an Animal animal
Animal animal
Baby I'mma lock you in my cage
