Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Punch it, in Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride is good looking, good looking

He tells that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, car
He's always with his car, car, car

So I rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Knock it, pump it, wash, pump it
Rub that glitter and grease
He loves it
Me so creamy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind it

New york on the weekend
Ain't nothing without your women
That guys girl is good looking
He buy me glasses baby
But it costs him a lot of money
He loves his car, car, car
He spends it on his car, car, car
So I...

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Knock it, pump it, wash, bumb it
Rub that glitter and grease
He loves it
He's so fine he makes her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind me

Knock it, pump it, wash, bumb it
Rub that glitter and grease
He loves it
He's so fine he makes her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behind me

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
