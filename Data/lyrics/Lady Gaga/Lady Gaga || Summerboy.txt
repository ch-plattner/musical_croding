Summer boy

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and im not around
Ive got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all

Sometimes, you might start a fight
But Im happy pretending we're alright (alright)
Sun glasses, cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah
While checking out other guys

We'll still have the summer after all
