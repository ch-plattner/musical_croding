Hold her hand through the black light 
Baby it's a forest land of trick slides 
Honey just take your time 
Close her eyes 

"I'm scared," she whispered 
As she wants to hide 
Into a back room where 
She paints on a smile 
She hears a sound 
She hears a sound 

It could have been love 
It could have been anybody 
Anybody, uh-oh 
She waited for love 
But there wasn't anybody 
Around so she left 
Town with the rock show 

Keep it cool at the freakshow 
Baby its a happy place 
If you lose it, honey 
Just take your time 
Close his eyes 

"Touch me," he whispered 
As he walks to the light 
From the window 
There's visions of 
A house in the night 
He hears a sound 
He hears a sound 

It could have been love 
It could have been anybody 
Anybody, uh-oh 
He waited for love 
But there wasn't anybody 
Around so he left 
Town with the rock show 

Hold her, tell her that you need her 
Please undress her slowly, uh-oh 
Never hold the girl too tightly 
She can't breathe when you speak 
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh! 

It could have been love 
It could have been anybody 
Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh 
We waited for love 
But there wasn't anybody 
Around so we left 
Town with the rock show 

Rock show, rock show, rock show
