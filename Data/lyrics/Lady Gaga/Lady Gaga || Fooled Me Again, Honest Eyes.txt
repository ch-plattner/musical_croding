
See the lonely girl 
Out on the weekend 
Tryin to make it pay 
She cant relate to joy, ohh 
She tries to speak it 
Cant begin to say 

The boy fooled me again 
Oh oh he loves me all up 
But I'm so down today 
See the lonely girl 
In Hollywood on the weekend 
Try to make it pay 

Its been a hard day 
Harder night 
The rockstars girlfriend 
She lost the fight 
Well its alright baby 
I'm nobodys mother 
But I dont want this last cigarette to be over 

You fooled me again 
Fooled me again 
With your 
Honest honest honest eyes 
Again fooled me again 
With your dirty mouth 
Full of honest lies 
Uh oh 
Again oh when you fooled me again Oh yeah 
You're so honest 
Full of shhh 
Honest eyes 

Its been two days 
Since he left home 
She dried her eyes 
Picked up her microphone 
She sang, its alright baby 
I'm nobodys mother 
Just dont want this last 
cigarette to be over, you know 

You fooled me again 
Fooled me again 
With your honest 
Honest honest eyes 
Again fooled me again 
With your dirty mouth 
Full of dirty lies 
Again oh when 
You fooled me again 
Oh yeah 
You're so honest 
Full of shhh 
Honest eyes 

You fooled me again 
Fooled me again 
With your honest 
Honest honest eyes 
Again, fooled me again 
With you dirty mouth 
full of thoes rust out New York lies 
Again oh when you fooled me again Oh baby yeah 
Youre so full of it 
At least your honest eyeeyeeyeeyeeyeyes 
Again honest honest 
you're so freakin honest 
na na nana na na nanananana 
you're so full of it 
at least your honest 
Eyes
