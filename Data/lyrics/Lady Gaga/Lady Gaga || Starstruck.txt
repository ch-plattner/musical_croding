Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Groove. Slam. Work it back. Space Cowboy just play that track.
Gaga in the room. So Starstruck Cherry Cherry Cherry Cherry Boom Boom.

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Stylin' out to the beat that you're freakin
Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin
Blow my heart up Put your hands on my waist pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up I'm the 12 on your table I'm so Starstruck...

[Chorus:]
I'm so Starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so Starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up

I'm so Starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up
I'm so Starstruck
Baby cause you blow my heart up

Baby now that were alone gotta request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?

Got your Dre headphones with the leftside on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth?Uh huh

Put your hands on my waist pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus
To the verse
Re-ke-re-ke-Reverse

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Hey lil mamma like really, really is that him
I done seen you before what you got on them big rims
Enter that cash flow, I'm like baby you dont trip

So shawty say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line and I suppose to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin down
She so star struck, the gal all stuck
I should have had an overdose too many Starbucks

Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Notice who let the top back on the Chevy impala
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars

But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagga, they go the dagga
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

[GaGa]
[Chorus]

Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.

Baby now that were alone gotta request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?

Got your Dre headphones with the leftside on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth?Uh huh

Put your hands on my waist pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus
To the verse
I'm so, I'm so...

[Chorus]

(Blow my heart up, i'm so, blow my heart up)
