Light me up with me on top let's falalalalalalala
Light me up with me on top let's falalalalalalala

The only place you wanna be is underneath my Christmas tree
The only place you wanna be is underneath my Christmas tree

Light me up with me on top let's falalalalalalala
Light me up with me on top let's falalalalalalala

Ho ho ho under the mistletoe (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes, everybody knows (Ra pa pam pam)
We will take off our clothes (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes, if you want us to we will

You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious

[Space Cowboy sings]
Light you up with you on top let's falalalala (lets go)
Light you up with you on top let's falalalala (lets go)

Ho ho ho under the mistle toe (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes, everybody knows (Ra pa pam pam)
We will take off our clothes (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes, if you want us to we will

[Lady GaGa sings]
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious

Here here here (Ra pa pam pam)
The best time of the year (Ra pa pam pam)
Take off my stockings where?
I'm spreading Christmas cheer
Yes, if you want us to we will

You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
