Ooh-ah

See that girl, watch her go
Red high heels and pretty toes
Silly puddy, dungaroos
Lady's got a killer groove
And you've got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls stand around and pose
Everybody knows in the boom boom room
We all take off our clothes, fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Oh baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody, let's take off our fancy pants tonight
(fancy, fancy, you're so fancy) [2x]
Grab those tight and lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight
(fancy, fancy, you're so fancy) [2x]

A girl's got a lot to lose

Everybody knows in the boom boom room
