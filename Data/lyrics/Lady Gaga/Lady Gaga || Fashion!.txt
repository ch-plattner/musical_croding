[Intro:]
Fashion!
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]
Slay, Slay
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]

[Verse 1:]
Fashion!
Step into the room
Like it's a catwalk
Fashion!
Singing to the tune
Just to keep them talking
Fashion!
Walk into the light
Display your diamonds and pearls in mine
Fashion!
Married to the night
I own the world, we own the world

[Chorus:]
Look at me now!
I feel on top of the world in my Fashion!
Look at me now!
I feel on top of the world in my Fashion
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]
Slay, slay
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]
Slay, slay

[Verse 2:]
You've got company
Make sure you look your best
Fashion!
Make up on your face
A new designer dress
Fashion!
There's a life on Mars
Where the couture is beyond, beyond
Fashion!
Married to the stars!
I own the world, we own the world!

[Chorus:]
Look at me now!
Like we're on top of the world in my Fashion!
Look at me now!
Like we're on top of the world in my Fashion!
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]
Slay, slay
Looking good and feeling fine [x3]
Slay, slay

[Bridge:]
I take it off, I put it on
I feel alive, when I transform
But this love's not material
Now take it in, and turn me on
Zip me up, it can't be wrong
Cause your new look's ethereal
Looking good, and feeling fine [x6]

[Outro:]
Je me sens
Fashion!
Donnez moi Christian Louboutins
Fashion!
Le monde est t√©moin
C'est la vie en
Fashion!
Je suis en haute couture en
Fashion!
Fashion, fashion! [x4]
