[Lady Gaga:]
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today

[Lady Gaga:]
And day's night today
And black's white today

[Tony Bennett:]
When most guys today that women prize today

[Lady Gaga:]
Are just silly gigolos

[Tony Bennett:]
And though I'm not a great romancer

[Lady Gaga:]
I know you're bound to answer

[Both:]
When we propose, anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
GO!

[Lady Gaga:]
GO!

[Lady Gaga:]
The world has gone mad today

[Tony Bennett:]
And good's bad today

[Lady Gaga:]
And day's night today

[Tony Bennett:]
And black's white today

[Lady Gaga:]
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

[Both:]
And though we're not such great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose, anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
Anything goes

[Lady Gaga:]
Anything goes

[Both:]
Anything goes
