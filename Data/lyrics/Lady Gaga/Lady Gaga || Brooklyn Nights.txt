[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you,
You always thought it was me.
We always thought we were it,
Seemed like a real perfect fit,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.

I always thought even though,
We were so young we could grow.
Up in the end it'd be us,
We'd take the F or the bus,
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.

[Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

[Verse 2]
I miss our cheap chandalier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV,
The one where the Russian scored,
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.

I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open our last beer,
Falling asleep in our tears,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.

[Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

[Bridge]
I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The walkup we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work.

I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating.
I want one last night there,
A Brooklyn Night affair.

[Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

[Outro]
Its not that I don't want to love you
Cause I really tried, and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.

Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu
