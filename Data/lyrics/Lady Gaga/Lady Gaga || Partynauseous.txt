Hands Up

Hi, I want to
Come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-a-arrest me
Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile
And a buzz buzz buzz buzz, we all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few
Drinks we're gonna unite, don't they

We're currently set from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS cause moi
Seem to have some problem with ya'

We're currently set from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS cause moi
Seem to have some problem with ya'

Nod
If you wanna be
High, with the enemy
It's a test
Are you proud enough
Do your best

Nod
If you wanna make
Love, with the enemy
Roll it up
Baby smoke it up 'til we're high

Now Jump

In a way exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic, I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
