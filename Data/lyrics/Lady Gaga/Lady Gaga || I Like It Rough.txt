Your love is nothing I can't fight,
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine.

I'm in the bedroom,
With tissues and when,
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in.
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world,
And I'm a hard girl,
Loving me is like chewing on pearls.

[Chorus:]
You've got me wandering why I,
I like it rough I,
I like it rough I,
I like it rough. [x2]

Won't go without my fix tonight,
It's a little too rough.
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines.
And she can't get enough.

I'm in the bedroom,
With tissues and when,
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in.
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world,
And I'm a hard girl,
Loving me is like straightening curls.

[Chorus]

I'm shiny and I know it,
Don't know why you wanna blow it,
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough. [x2]

Is it because you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes it's rough. [x2]
(Lady Gaga)

[Chorus]
