Reel cool
Reel, reel cool

Hey there, weatherman
What’s your name?
Hey, hey
In this corporation
The prediction’s a high roller’s game.

Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We don’t mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Reel cool

Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Keep that shit reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We don’t mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Hey there, weather guy
What’s your name?
She’s some kind of trouble,
Fuzz your hands and the smoking chain

Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Keep that shit reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We don’t mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
