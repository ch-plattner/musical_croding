What if I were to leave you?
But then, you fell back in love with me

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar
I just can't seem to forget you! 
Not ever since as long as I left you!
Your my baby, you 
Never made it through to you 

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar
I just can't seem to forget you! 
Not ever since as long as I left you!
Your my baby, you 
Never made it through to you 

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Instrumental]

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me....
