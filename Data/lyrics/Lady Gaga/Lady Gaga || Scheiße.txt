[Intro:]
I don't speak German, but I can if you'd like. Oh!

[Post-Chorus: x3]
Ich schleiban austa be clair
Es kumpent madre monstere,
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen,
Begun be üske but-bair
Ich schleiban austa be clair,
Es kumpent üske monstère,
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen,
Fräulein uske-be clair

[Verse 1:]
I'll take you out tonight,
Say whatever you like.
Scheiße-scheiße be mine,
Scheiße be mine (Scheiße be mine)

Put on a show tonight,
Do whatever you like.
Scheiße-scheiße be mine,
Scheiße be mine (Scheiße be mine)

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I'm on a mission
I rebuke my condition.
If you're a strong female,
You don't need permission.

[Chorus:]
I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer.
I, I wish I could be strong without somebody there.
I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer.

[Verse 2:]
Love is objectified by what men say is right
Scheiße-scheiße be mine,
Bullshit be mine (bullshit be mine)
Blonde high-heeled feminist enlisting femmes for this
Express your woman-kind
Fight for your right (fight for your right)

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I'm on a mission
I rebuke my condition.
If you're a strong female,
You don't need permission.
