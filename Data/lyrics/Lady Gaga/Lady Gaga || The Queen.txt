Oh
Tonight I'm gonna show
Them what I'm made of, oh!
The killer queen inside me's
Coming to say "Hello!"

Oh
Tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you I'd watch them all be burnt

Whoa-Oh, Whoa-Oh

Whenever I start feeling strong, I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed it's happening 
I can be the queen

I am wind and hurricane
The stormy sky and rain
When you run dry I'll flood your pain

Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh

In between the moments of
The lady I've become
A voice beats through the noise like drums 

Rhomp-a-bump-a

Whenever I start feeling strong, I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed it's happening 
I can be the queen

The quee-ee-ee-ee-een
The que-ee-een
Quee-ee-een
Quee-ee-een

Starry night come inside me like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door
I will fly on a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

Oh whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
