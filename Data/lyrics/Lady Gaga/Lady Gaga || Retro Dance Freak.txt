Hello everybody! 
Get a ride to the west side, 
Kiss the girl with her tongue tied. 

Hello everybody! 
We'll get out cause you don't care, 
Shut down like software. 

Hello everybody! 
Take a sip for the hip-hop, 
If you look for the rest stop. 

We're just physical creatures of the underworld, 
She is the queen of the faux Disco Scene. 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats, 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, the girl needs her lover 

What's up everybody? 
Take a ride on an airplane, 
Take a bath in champagne. 

Whats up everybody? 
Watch the girls all curtsy, 
For the paparazzi! 

Let's go, everybody! 
It's time that we rotate, 
'Cause it's getting real late. 

We're Just Physical Creatures Of The Underworld 
She is the queen of the Faux Disco Scene 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats (Retro, Retro, Freak ...) 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, the girl needs her lover. 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats (Retro, Retro, Freak ...) 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, the girl needs her lover. 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats (Retro, Retro, Freak ...) 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, oh, the girl she needs her lover 

We're Just Physical Creatures Of The Underworld 
She is the queen of the Faux Disco Scene 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats (Retro, Retro, Freak ...) 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, the girl needs her lover 

Retro, Dance, Freak! (Retro, Retro, Dance ...) 
Singin' retro-dance beats (Retro, Retro, Freak ...) 
Retro, Dance, Freak! 
Undercover, the girl needs her lover
