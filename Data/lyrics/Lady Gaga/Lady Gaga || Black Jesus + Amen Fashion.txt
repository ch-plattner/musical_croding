Jesus is the new black

I grew up in New York City,
Since I was born on Broadway, baby!
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen,
To start a new life on the New York scene.

There's no way I could be stopped,
Was taking my best shot,
I had a better plan.
There's no way I could be stopped,
Was coming for your spot.
I'm in a battle, man.

[*]
Amen, on the runway,
dressed in his best.
Amen Fashion, on the runway,
Work it! Black Jesus.
Amen, on the runway,
dressed in his best.
Amen Fashion, on the runway,
Work it! Black Jesus.

Dancing in my revelation,
Underground pop civilization.
Concrete poetry to feed my mind,
Old symbolism was left behind.

There's no way I could be stopped,
Was taking my best shot,
I had a better plan,
There's no way I could be stopped,
Was coming for your spot.
I'm in a battle, man.
