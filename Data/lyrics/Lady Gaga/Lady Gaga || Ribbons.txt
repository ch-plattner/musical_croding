I'm not bad I just sound that way!

All the girls, they like their presents
Like their presents
When boys wrap 'em up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive
If they're well thought out, sexed up, wrapped right
Everytime, get in line, & give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes -- wrap 'em up in ribbons!

Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons, silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons 
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap 'em up in pretty, pretty ribbons!

Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up

Only difference between downtown and uptown
Is therapy and Valium, therapy and Valium
Not lying when I say this
There's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and Valium, therapy and Valium

It's not complicated
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up

Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap
Them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
In ribbons!
Wrap them presents up

Wrap
Wrap them presents up
Wrap them presents up
Wrap
