Hello 
It's nice to meet you. 
You are very cute. 
Robo man. 

I cant help my self 
I'm in love, 
And when I get back from outter space 
I'm gonna punch him in his face 

If he's the moon 
Then I'm eclipsed 
I'm so lunar yeah when I get to him 
I'll run him over with my rocket ship. 

My eyeliner runs in constellations 
For you dear 
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart 
I'd think clear 

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world, 
Baby with you I'm a different girl 
Ohhh, ohhh, ohh you're my future love. 

Baby could we make a home in the stars 
Baby somewhere in a galaxy far 
Ohh, ohhh, ohh you're my future love 

Ohohohoh, I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love, 
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
Would you be my fu-fu-fu future man 
I wanna fu- fuck you as hard as I can 
Would you put me in your fu- future plans 
I want a fu-fu-fu future man. 

I've been working and engineering, uh 
All our chemistries and our situations 
Working out our sex equations, 
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah 
Cause my hair is blond but my heart's brunette 

If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest 

My mascara runs in constellations 
For you dear, my dear 
If only I could outer space my brain 
For a minute 
I'd think clear (I love you so much) 

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world, 
Baby with your I'm a different girl 
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh you're my future love. 

Baby could we make a home in the stars 
Baby somewhere in a galaxy far 
Ohh, ohhh, ohh you're my future love 

Ohohohoh, I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love, 
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love 
Would you be my fu-fu-fu future man 
I wanna fu- fuck you as hard as I can 
Would you put me in your fu- future plans 
I want a fu-fu-fu future man. 

If you could only take me in 
To a place we've never been 
He is so unreal yeah! 
He's a mannequin 
A synthetic, plastic, robo man 

And I'm relying on, on a shooting star 
To get to you my future love ah ah 
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy 
And I'm stuck in his metal robo ey-ey-ey-eyes! 
Robo ey-ey-ey-eyes! 
My future guy 

Parumpumpumpumpumpumpum.
