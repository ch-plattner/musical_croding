[Tony Bennett:]
She gets too hungry for dinner at 8

[Lady Gaga:]
(I'm starving)

[Tony Bennett:]
She loves the theater but she never comes late

[Lady Gaga:]
I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp

[Tony Bennett:]
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls

[Lady Gaga:]
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls

[Tony Bennett:]
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the free fresh wind in my hair

[Tony Bennett:]
Life without care

[Lady Gaga:]
Oh, I'm so broke,

[Tony Bennett:]
It's OK

[Lady Gaga:]
I hate California. It's crowded and damp

[Tony Bennett:]
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I'm a tramp!

Sometimes I go to Coney Island

[Tony Bennett:]
Oh, the beach is divine

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the Yankees

[Tony Bennett:]
Jeter is just fine

[Lady Gaga:]
I follow Rogers and Hart

[Tony Bennett:]
She sings every line

[BOTH:]
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the prize fight

[Tony Bennett:]
That isn't a fake

[Lady Gaga:]
No fakes

And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake

[Tony Bennett:]
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake

[Lady Gaga:]
Yes I do

That's why this lady is a tramp

[Tony Bennett:]
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes

[Lady Gaga:]
What can I lose? 'cause I got no dough (Oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp

[Tony Bennett:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
Go

[Lady Gaga:]
I love your free, fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair

[Tony Bennett:]
Life without care

[Lady Gaga:]
But I'm so broke!

[Tony Bennett:]
That's OK!

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp

[BOTH:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp!

[Lady Gaga:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
