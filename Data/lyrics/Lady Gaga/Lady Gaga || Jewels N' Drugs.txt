
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-G
Get your doe or die partna
Yup, let's go

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah you know what it is
Pockets full of number of rubber bands and bills
Came up around that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal about 60 mill
You ain't live that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga...

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's is expensive
And you may find it, quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother sister, your father brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Airbody want that money what you want
High as hell trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels n' drugs

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money
