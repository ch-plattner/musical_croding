
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, Madame, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do

You know what?, you're lovely
And so what? I'm lovely
And, oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, we're not asbestos

And that's why I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
We know that music leads the way to romance,
So if I hold you in my arms I won't dance

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos

And that's why I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
We know that music leads the way to romance,
So if I hold you in my arms I won't dance
I won't dance, I won't dance, I won't dance
I won't dance, dance, dance
I won't dance
Dance
