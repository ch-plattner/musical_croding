[INTRO:]
I met a girl in east LA
In floral shorts - as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love, but not in court

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

Manos-
Manos-

[POST-CHORUS:]
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano

[VERSE 1:]
Mis canciones son de la revolución [my songs are of the revolution]
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación [my heart hurts for my generation]

If you love me, we can marry, on the west coast,
On a Wednesday, en un verano, en agosto

[CHORUS:]
I don't speak your, I don't speak your language oh no (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)

[POST-CHORUS:]
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano

[VERSE 2:]
I will fight for, I have fought for how I love you (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I have cried for, I will die for how I care (La-la-la-la-la-la)
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando (The bells are ringing)
Todos los chicos (chicas), y los chicos (chicas) están besando
[And the boys (girls), and the boys (girls) are kissing]

[CHORUS:]
I don't speak your, I don't speak your language oh no (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I don't speak your Americano (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)

[POST-CHORUS:]
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano

[BRIDGE/OUTRO:]
Don't you try and catch me,
Don't you try and catch me,
No! No! No! No!
I'm living on the edge of,
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law

Don't you try and catch me,
Don't you try and get me,
No! No! No! No!
Don't you try to catch me,
I'm living on the edge of the law, law, law, law.
