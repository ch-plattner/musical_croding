I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blonde south
Red wine, cheap perfume and a filthy pout
Tonight bring all your friends
Because a group does it better

Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

Dirty Pony I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town
Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets drink beer and get into trouble

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

I could be your girl girl girl girl girl girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world world world?

Whip me slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Budlite liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night, with St.J-ameson
Like a baptism, Heavy Metal lovers Play
Baby we were born this way

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

Ooh ooh ooh Who who who
Who Who who ooh who who
Who Who Heavy Metal Lover

I could be your girl girl girl girl girl girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world world world?

Heavy Metal Lover
