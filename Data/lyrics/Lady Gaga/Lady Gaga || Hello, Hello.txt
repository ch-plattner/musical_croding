[Elton John]
Feel a feeling light
Headed out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?

[Lady Gaga]
Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

[Elton John]
Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

[Elton John]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

[Elton John]
Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Running through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me

[Elton John]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

[Both]
And I can fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all leaves from a tree
If there's a quest of a knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Do this better than the one I used to be

[Elton John]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

[Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
[x2]

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
