
Got no plans, got no clothes
Got no piano, we got no shows
No, I've got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Got no flights, out of here
Got no TV shows until next year
No I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Baby, you're my liquor
I'm addicted to you
So I'll just be stuck on
Stuck on fuckin' you
Stuck on fuckin' you

I don't ever want just another boy or a girl
Baby you and I,
Baby you and I could change the world
I don't ever want just another boy or a girl to love
I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck on you

Got all night, no cameras
We got no champagne but we got drugs
No, I've got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Purple sheets, symbol clock
Gonna spend my time rocking on top
Yeah, I've got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Baby you're my Johnny Walker, baby it's true
So I'll just be stuck on, stuck on fuckin' you
Stuck on fuckin' you

I don't ever want just another boy or a girl
Cause baby you and I,
Baby you and I could change the world
I don't ever want just another boy or a girl to love
I'm stuck, stuck, stuck on you, On you

Got no plans, got no flights
Out of here, no TV shows
But we got mice in the kitchen
So we don't care cause we're in love

Get in the shower, I'll meet you there
I bought you some hippie shit from the Deli down the stairs, oh yeah
Lovin on my man's space, so good

Don't forget me baby
Don't forget me when I leave and go on tour
Cause I know your life will be a snore
You'll be on stuck fuckin' this hooker whore
This hooker, wh-ooh-re

Got no nothing, you're in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus
While me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you

The fridge is broke and we're drinking warm champagne
But we don't care 'cause we're in Minnesota
And we're sold out show again
And it's a sold out show again

[laugh] OK, just stop it, I could go on forever...
