
I can't remember when
you looked at me and cried
said something broke inside of you
were my best friend
whatever come our way
you know I'm your girl 'til the end

and when I finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day

when you let love down
oh you let love down
I don't have to remind you
but you know that I'm around
when you let love down
oh you let me down
can I let love down
let it down

I can't remember when
you put your head on mine
but couldn't play in time when we
when we're not together
just sing a little song
blueberry kisses forever

and when I finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day
oh yeah, it's so sad

when you let love down
oh you let love down
I don't have to remind you
but you know that I'm around
when you let love down
oh you let me down
can I let love down
let it down

don't let me down
oh, don't let me down

when you let love down
oh you let love down
I don't have to remind you
but you know that I'm around
when you let love down
oh you let me down

don't let me down
let it down
yeah let me down
...
let it down (3x)
