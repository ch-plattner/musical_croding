
So you met someone who
Set you back on your heels,
Goody goody!
So you met someone and
Now you know how it feels,
Goody goody!
So you gave him your heart too,
Just as I gave mine to you,
And he broke it in little pieces,
And now how do you do?

So you lie awake
Just singing the blues all night,
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a
Barrel of dynamite,
Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya,
Goody goody for him,
Goody goody for me,
And I hope you're satisfied
You rascal you...

And he broke it in little pieces,
And now how do you do?

So you lie awake
Just singing the blues all night,
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel
Of dynamite,
Oo-oo, hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya,
Goody goody for him,
Goody goody goody for me!
Your love has been denied,
You've been taken for a ride,
And I hope you're satisfied
You rascal you!
