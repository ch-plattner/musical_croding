Swag on a hundred million
Private plane like Lady Gaga
Sip champagne like Lady Gaga

Iced-out wrist, iced-out chain

Fuck your face, trick bitch
Fuck your life, trick bitch 
I'm caked up and I'll fuck your wife
Fuck your life you bitch ass trick

Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap

Snatch your fucking weave out bitch
In front of paparazzi, singing paparazzi in this bitch

Ask my man, Hedi at Yves about EMI,

Shut shit down like Lady Gaga
Iced-out crown and Miuccia Prada

Skull tattoo I hate your daughter
