[Verse 1:]
Corks off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this
Drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins

Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'd hate myself until I die

[Chorus:]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus:]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Verse 2:]
Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul

Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
[Post-Chorus]

[Outro:]
I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope
