That's M-O-N-E-Y, so sexy, I 

Damn I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yea
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh yea

It's good to live expensive you know it but
My knees get weak, intensive

[Chorus]
When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

That's M-O-N-E-Y, so sexy, I
That's money honey

Damn I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yea
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh yea

Its good to live expensive you know it but 
My knees get weak, intensive

[Chorus]

You know I appreciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest baby
{I can do without it babe}
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby

[Chorus x3]
