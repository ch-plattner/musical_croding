Your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh!
Your super lover.

Black lights and designer blues
With my tattoos of I-love-yous.
I just put on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you.

I’m livin’ it up,
Secretly he notices I’m playin’ it up
For him
Playin’ it up.
I’m livin’ it up,
Dancin’ on the tables as the DJ’s
Spinnin’ it up
For me
Spinnin’ it up
For me

When the sun goes down
And the care ends up
It’s time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playin’ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
I’m on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
I’m craving your attention
So now…

Go back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Gonna be your super lover.
Right back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
I’ma be your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.

Too hot for the masses,
She’s on fire.
Think I’m gonna let her burn.
Champagne in the glasses,
Flip the bottle, baby.
Come ‘n’ take your turn.
She’s on my radar.
Catch ya later
Cuz she knows
When I push the fader
She ain’t leaving me alone.

Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

I’m livin’ it up.
Dancin’ on the tables
Mister DJ spinnin’ it up
With you.
Spinnin’ it up
For you.

When the sun goes down
And the care ends up
It’s time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playin’ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
I’m on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
I’m craving your attention
So now…

Go back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Gonna be your super lover.
Right back to the beat
Get up on your feet
I’ma be your super lover.

Hold up, hold up.
Take me where you get to know them.
Hold up, hold up.
Cuz they’re trynna get my clothes off.

When the sun goes down
And the care is up
It’s time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playin’ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
I’m on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
I’m craving your attention.
