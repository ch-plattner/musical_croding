I'm calling cause I need you,
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get,
And you know how good I can be.
I'm calling just to tell you,
Get here and I'll make it worth, your while
I can make you some good
Boy, and then I can make you smile

[Chorus:]
Cause I've got nothing on, but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight.
(Nothing) Nothing on but the radio,
And I'm tuned into your station tonight,
With me tonight.

You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hand
Wait till I get my hands on you

[Chorus:]
Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
(Nothing) nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight

When you get here, boy, we can dance.
Our hands on the headboard, it's our defense.
I've turned the lights down low,
And I've got nothing on but the radio.

Got too much time on my hands.
Wait 'til I get my hands on you.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio,
And I've got nothing on for tonight.
(Nothing) Nothing on but the radio,
And I'm tuned into your station tonight,
With me tonight.
Oh-Oh-Oh
I've got nothing on but the radio,
And I've got nothing on for tonight.
(Nothing) Nothing on but the radio,
And I'm tuned into your station tonight,
With me tonight.
