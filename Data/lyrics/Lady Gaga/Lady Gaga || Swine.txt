[Verse 1:]
Hush up, don't speak, don't wanna hear another (not another word from you)
You're just an ani-mal trying to act real special (but deep down you are just a shrew)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine!
Act like a swine! Act like a swine!

[Chorus:]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squealer, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside...
Do you? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squealer, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside...

SWINE! [x4]

[Beat break]

Swine! [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Be that hog sweat it out, you squealer? (let your body jiggle)
Slap her skinâ€“he love to watch her ass go wiggle (it's the feel of ecstasy)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine!
Act like a swine! Act like a swine!

[Chorus]

SWINE! [x4]

[Beat break]

[Outro:]
Paint your face and
Paint his face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just
(Catch the beat)
For the weekend
(Catch the beat) [etc.]
Swine!
