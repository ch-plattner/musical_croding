It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part, rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see
Where is home, I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Sometimes I wonder if god hides out in cities to set us free
'cause yeah, this room is crowded
But I am so alone in it, help me please
Where is home, I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here [2x]

And I will be strong, I won't give in
I won't deny you, I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears, my tears yeah

I wish you were here [2x]
Where is home
I want you to know
Oh, yeah

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here [2x]
