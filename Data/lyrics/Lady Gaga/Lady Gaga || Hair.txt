Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa

Whenever I'm dressed cool
My parents put up a fight
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And if I'm hot shot
Mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh huh, uh huh)

And in the morning
I'm short of my identity
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I scream Mom and Dad
Why can't I be who I wanna be?
(Uh huh, uh huh)
To be

I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know, I am my hair

[Chorus:]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

[2x:]
Free as my hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair

Sometimes I want some raccoons
Or red highlights
Just because I want my friends
To think I'm dynamite

And on Friday rock city
High school dance
I got my bangs to hide
That I don't stand a chance, a chance

I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know, I am my hair

[Chorus]

[2x:]
Free as my hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair

I just want to be free, I just want to be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bare

I am my hair, I'm my hair
I am my hair, I'm hair
I am my hair, I'm hair
I am my hair, I'm hair
It's all the glory that I bare

I am my hair, I am my hair
I am a hair, yeah
It's all the glory that I bare
I am my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
My hair, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
Ooh I'm my hair, I'm my hair
