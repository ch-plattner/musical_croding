Boy, we've had a real' good time
And I wish you the best on your way
Eh eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place
Eh eh, hey ey

I had something that I love long
But my friends keep telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliqu√©es
Eh eh
I met somebody cute and funny
got each other and that's funny
Eh eh, hey ey

I had something that I love long
But my friends keep telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

(Eh eh, eh eh, eh eh...)

Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh

There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say

Oh yeah

All I can say is eh eh
