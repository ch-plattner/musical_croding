[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me want to scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you wanna know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus 1: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
My bones hurt
From all the shows
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
And then I'm ok,
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want (Ooh, do what you want don't stop let's party)
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you wanna know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus 2: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go (aah, aah)
I would fall apart (apart)
If you break my heart (ooh)
So just take my body (body)
And don't stop the party ([Christina:] AHHHHHHH!)

[Chorus 3: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body (Do what you want, do what you want, OOH!)
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause (my voice)
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body (Do what you want with me, Ooh)
(Do what you want) with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
[Gaga:] Do what you want with me
[Christina:] What you want Lady Gaga?
[Gaga:] What you want with me Christina?
[Christina:] Ooh what you want with my body
[Gaga:] Do what you want with me
[Both:] (Ooh) what you want with my body
[Gaga:] Do what you want with me
[Both:] What you want with my body world
[Both:] Help me now
[Christina:] What you want with my body world
[Gaga:] Do what you want with my body, (Hey!) do what you want with my body...
