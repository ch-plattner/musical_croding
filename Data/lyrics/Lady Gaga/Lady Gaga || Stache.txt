Princess high die
Where's my stache?
Want to get high guy
I need my
Have you seen my
I can't find my

Where's my stache?
Can you feed my love
Cannabis
Can you feed my love
Where's my stache?
Where's my stache?
Cannabis
High princess

There's no exit, we're in John Paul's Sartre
Hope you don't think my obsession is awkward

[beat break]

Princess high die
Princess die high
Princess high die
Princess die high

There's no particular thing that I want
There's no particular drug that I love
But when I can't find my stache I give up
I need to deal with myself and get messed up

Where's my stache?
Can you feed my love
Cannabis
Can you feed my love
Where's my stache?
Where's my stache?
Cannabis
High princess

Where's my stache?
DJ Zedd, Anton turn it up
Let's party, let's get messed up
Let's get messed up
Let's get messed up
You're so messed up
Psychotic music head
