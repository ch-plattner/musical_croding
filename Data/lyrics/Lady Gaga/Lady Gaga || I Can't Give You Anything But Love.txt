[Lady Gaga:]
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I like to see you looking swell, tony with
Diamond watches, Tiffany's just don't sell, baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love.

[Tony Bennett:]
I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
Dream awhile, scheme a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for
How you like to see me looking swell? lady
Diamond bracelets, Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga

[Duet:]
Till the lucky day you know darn well, baby
Oh I can't give you anything, I don't want just anything
Oh I can't give you anything but love
