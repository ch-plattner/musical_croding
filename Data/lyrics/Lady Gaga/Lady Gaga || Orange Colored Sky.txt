
I was walking along, minding my business,
When out of the orange colored sky,
Flash, bam, alacazam, wonderful you came by.

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.

Ohhh,
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass.
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, this is it, this is it.

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored sky.

Ohhh,
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass.
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, this is it, this is it.

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wam, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka dot skyyy
Flash, bam, alacazaaam,
Had gooonnne, bye.
Good bye.
