
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)
You want me bad
I think you’re cool
But I’m not sure
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)

Follow me
Don’t be such a holy fool
Follow me
I need something more from you

It’s not about sex or champagne
You holy fool

If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In Electric Chapel

Confess to me where you have been
Next to the bar
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)
Pray for your sins
Right under the glass disco ball
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)

Follow me
Don’t be such a holy fool
Follow me
I need something sacred from you
Together we’ll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In Electric Chapel

Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh

If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In Electric Chapel
