Oooooooh Oh Oh Oh,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,

I,need somebody who calls my name,
when Clouds are smokin Up My Way,
You Get Me Through these Ch-Changing Skies,
I don't wanna be afraid again,
It's just that I Could use a friend to get me, through these Ch-Changing Skies,

Give Me Something That I, 
Can Wrestle to the ground,
There isn't anything that I Can Handle Now We're Out,
Believe Me when I say, That I Will Be Ok,
And Listen, that's advised
and my Ch-Changing Skies,

Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing 
Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing 
Changing skies 
Changing skies 
Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing

Oooooooh Oh Oh Oh,
Oooooooh Oh Oh Oh,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh, 

I, Don't Wanna Be That Kind Of Guy,
I Wanna Dance Right through the night, 
To get me through these Ch-Changing Skies, 
Know, that I am not emotional 
It's just that I don't Wanna Fall 
Without My Parachute tonight,

Give Me Something That I, 
Can Wrestle to the ground,
There isn't anything that I Can Handle Now We're Out,
Believe Me when I say, That I Will Be Ok,
And Listen, that's advised
and my Ch-Changing Skies,

Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing 
Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing 
Changing skies 
Changing skies 
Changing skies 
Ch-ch-ch-changing
