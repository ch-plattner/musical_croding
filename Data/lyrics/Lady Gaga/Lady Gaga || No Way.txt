
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it was'nt mine.
You and her, I know that you were intertwined.
Even though, her clothes were on and everything.
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both to blame.

Don't say a word, I'm sure that it won't be enough.
To erase what I know just happens, isn't that what dreams are made of?
This is my house and I won't allow the disrespect.
Baby don't look at me like that I don't belong to you anyway.

'Cause baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say?
We went so wrong and what you did but I still feel this way.
And I can't believe it, or forget it, what I saw today.
And if you're wondering if I'm staying the answer is no way!
No Way! (I can't believe it)
No Way! (I can't believe it babe)
No Way!

Thought that I saw, something I know did not belong to me.
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me.
And then last week, when you went outside to use your phone.
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold.

And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare.
'Cause I now have those, it is'nt real like this one is.
This is my heart and I won't allow the disrespect.
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you anyway.

'Cause baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say?
We went so wrong and what you did but I still feel this way.
And I can't believe it, or forget it, what I saw today.
And if you're wondering if I'm staying the answer is no way!
No Way! (I can't believe it)
No Way! (I can't believe it babe)
No Way!

Get your things and go...
You can take the dinner left over from last night,
I made your favorite. Goodbye.

'Cause baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say?
