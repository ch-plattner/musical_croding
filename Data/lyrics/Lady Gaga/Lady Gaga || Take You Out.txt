Last week I saw you out and I knew we would be a match in heaven
Just the coolest kind of team
I. I know there ain’t now way that we won’t
cause we won’t stop till we go
go the distance we’re a distance
baby I believe it
I still believe it
and you know won’t be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it

baby I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
we’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
shoot it run it what’s it called?
everybody loves it, football.
shoot it run it what’s it called?
everybody loves it, football.

I’ve got the feeling that this year could be the one
we’re gonna tear it up and burn out every one
I I know there ain’t now way that we won’t
cause we won’t stop till we go
go the distance we’re a distance
baby I believe it
I still believe it
and you know won’t be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it

baby I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
we’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
(shoot it run it what’s it called?
everybody loves it, football. [x4])

new york, london, paris, munich
everybody talk about pop music

I still believe it
and you know won’t be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it
baby I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
we’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about [x2]
