
I don't know why you're hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me and when
You feel like your not enough
I'll give you wings I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest, greatest thing to me

I don't wanna waste another day
And took hand off you up in the middle of the day
What I can see is you waste another day

Cuz when I'm with you I fall apart,
I see your permanently broken heart.
Baby, your the greatest to me,
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you're hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest
Thing to me and when
You feel like you're not enough
I'll give you wings I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest
Greatest thing to me
