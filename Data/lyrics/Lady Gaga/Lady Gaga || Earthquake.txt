What if I were to leave you, but then you fell back in love with me?

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever ever let me go-oh-oh

I scream your name across the bar 
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar

No I just can't seem to forget you 
No I can't for just as I met you
You're my babe right through 
Never made it through to you

If I were the last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
There was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love 
Maybe then you'd love me if I were the last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
There was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me

If there was an earthquake 

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever ever let me go-oh-oh

I scream your name across the bar 
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar

No I just can't seem to forget you
No I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

If I were the last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet 
There was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love 
Maybe then you'd love me if I were the last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet 
There was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me

If I were the last girl and you were the last boy left here on this planet
There was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me
Last girl and you were the last boy left here on this planet 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
