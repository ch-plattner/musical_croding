I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak (me too)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river, or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you will carry me through to...

Heaven (heaven)
Yes I'm in heaven (I'm in heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you will carry me through to...

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
Oh baby when we're out together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
