[Lady Gaga:]
Hey babe,
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy.
I know that we got something special, boy.
But lately I've been feelin' naughtier than usual.

You see I 
I need a love that's crazy don't you see?
I'm looking for someone who can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know.
You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say he loveth me.

Give it up
Put it up
Not enough
Not enough

I need it 
Out of control

Give it up just let your body

[Nicki Minaj:]
Wobbledy wobble, wo-wo-wobble, wobbin'
Ass so fat, all these bitches' pussies is throbbin'
Bad bitches, I'm your leader, phantom by the meter
Somebody point me to the best ass-eater
Tell 'em "Pussy clean!" I tell 'em "Pussy squeaky!"
Niggas give me brain 'cause all of them niggas geeky
If he got a mandingo, then I buy him a dashiki
And bust this pussy open in the islands of Waikikiiiiii...

[Beyoncé:]
Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, puffin' on them mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all in his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all in his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
