Beautiful, dirty dirty rich rich dirty dirty beautiful dirty rich
Dirty dirty rich dirty dirty rich beautiful

Beautiful and dirty dirty rich rich We've got a redlight pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey but we go no money

Our hair is perfect, while were all getting shit wrecked, it's automatic, honey but we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry yea, we just like to party, like to party yea,

Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich
Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich

We live a cute life, soundfanatic,
Pants tighter than plastic, honey
but we got no money

We do the dance right, we have go it made like icecream topped with honey
But we got no money
Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry yea, we just like to party, like to party yea,

Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich
Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich

A bang bang bang, bang bang bang, beautiful, dirty rich
A bang bang bang, bang bang bang, beautiful, dirty rich

Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich
Bang Bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich

Bang bang

Bang bang
