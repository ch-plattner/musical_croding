
Look, through the trees, past the sky
Beyond the northern lights.
You're will see, my delight
Reflecting in your eyes
And I won't let go, if you wait for me
Whenever, wherever
And then you, select the destination
Wherever, whenever

We'll go-ooo-oooo-ooo
Wherever, whenever
We'll go-ooo-oooo-ooo-ooo.
I wa- I-wa I wanna love forever, love forever, baby.
Wherever, wherever you wanna go (One day)
Do-do whatever, do whatever baby
Wherever, wherever, forever together

I fell asleep, don't know why
You let me come alive
You and me, we collide
Ignite the starry fire
And you warm me up, and you wait for it
Whenever, whenever
And then you wake me up, and you wait for it
Whenever, whenever

I wanna go-oooo-ooo-oooo
Wherever, whenever
I wanna go-oooo-ooo-oooooo
I wa- I-wa I wanna love forever, love forever, baby.
Wherever, wherever you wanna go (One day)
Do-do whatever, do whatever baby
Wherever, wherever, forever together
Whenever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever

I love you forever and ever and always I love you
Whenever you need me
I'll be right there by you
Whenever you call me
I'm there when you call
Whenever you're falling
I'm there when you fall
Wherever your going
I'll be right there showing
Our love's always growing and growing and growing
I know that you know it, there's no need for guessing
When I am requesting, I'm there with no questions
Asked... I'll go, wherever, whenever
If ever, you need me, I'll be here
Forever
