
Yeah, that's Funky (Funky)
Yeah, that's Funky (Funky)
Yeah, that's Funky (Funky)

If it smells like Funk it must be us
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us 
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us 
Cause nobody's Funky as us, Cause we keep it Stinky (Stinky)
We keep it Stinky, (Stinky)
We keep it Stinky, (Stinky)
We keep it Stinky, (Stinky)
Stinky, Stinky, Stinky, 

The Funk phenomenon, we Funk you on n' on
There's no need to hold your nose,
Cause this pong sing like a rouge

Big booty Funk, Toe jam Funk,
Underarm Funk, like you headlocking a Skunk'
Reaking like diseased athleates feet,
The stench didn't come till after this beat
Smellin' like droors no weezin no pause
Put your hand up on the speakers get smelly ass paws
You know we was coming before we entered the door
Cause you could smell the rhyme when we was walking down the hall
We bring the Funk worse then a wet dog
Stinkin' like fat ladies shittin' out Logs
We drop enough shit and keep them toilets clogged
Keep the people jumpin' like them Bullfrogs
The first one who smelt it ain't the one who delt it
Black Eyed Peas keep the scent blind like delta
Funky like onions you fryin' (Sure is Funky) girl you ain't lyin'

[CHORUS]

Yo' you Funkin' with the Funk family
The non fabricated factual faculty'
We formulatin' up in a factory
Focusin' on the energid' of fluid flow free'
We flawless, everything is for free
We florish and we flaunt our flavour freshly, huh'
Can you believe we flip the frequency's and
Freak MCs they leave all franticaly but'
Our intent is ought to be friendly but'
They fightin' when we start the freestylin' frenzy
I conk up ya' flat till your girlfriend beef
Fillin all anatomy, bringin' me flatery, huh'
She'll be diggin these rhymes that ease beats 
Like celulite lyrics so flabby
We bring the funk to your festivities
If you think something stank then it must be the peas!

If it smells like Funk it must be us
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The Funk Funk full foul stinky it's stanky stuff 
If it smells like Funk it must be us 
Cause nobody's Funky as us, cause we keep it Stinky
(Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky)

Celulite overweight stankin' MCs
Stench smells so strong it's insanitary
Cause you can sense me a mile away so Chanky
With the jungle Funk sound from Serengeti
Meaty, Fat, Nasty like miss Fat booty's tights
Gettin' dirty like mudfights and dirtbikes
Turning these droors black they used to be white 
And we shitin' on these tracks that you gonna' need to wipe
The odour's so contagious that it shows up in your dream
Man you could pick me out like food in between 
Your two front teeth cause you be lackin' the streets
We got beefy ass beats that we bumpin' in the streets
We so nice n' sweet like steak box n' feet
Sour underarm Funk you ain't washed in a week
And man we be reekin' every day or weekend
We could all bounce to the Funk and the season

Haha haha
Yeah that's Funky',
Yeah that's Funky'

Every smell is of a porker 
then you know it got to be nobody other than Apl, Will n' Taboo
Cause if you know that if it smells like Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' Fat Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' something Funky 
then you know it got to be nobody other than Apl, Will n' Taboo
Cause you know that if it smells like Funk than it must be us
If you smellin' elephants than it must be us
If you smellin' somethin Funky 
then you know it got to be nobody other than Apl, Will n' Taboo 
Cause you know that if it smells like Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' elephant shit then it must be us [FADE]
