[Verse 1]
I took ur picture, with one particluar reason and its to capture ur character,
I like to sit and stare at 'cha
Aint nothin wrong with starin at cha
Girl don't be scared at the fact that I envison us getting married and I ain't tryin to rush nuttin
Cuz I aint rushin
It'll take a time like, "whats them things that move slow you knowthem...damn..I cant think cuz u on my mind..."
And when u on my mindi cant find anything to ryhme with ryhme
I gotta ryhme ryhme with mixture
And speakin of mixture
With you I wanna be mixed up
Im like a record and ur like a record
So lets let the DJ mix us
Ur like an elixir
Thats got me tipsy,
This is just like Ripley's "Believe it or not" girl
But I love you

[chorus]
Girl u really got me goin
Outta control
I dot know what im doin
Lets let it go
And do what we do best
Take off our clothes
We look better undressed

[Bridge-repeat 2x]
Yes to sex
Yes to sex
No to War
No to war
Fightin' is rightin'
Fightin' is rightin'
Yes to sex
It's so much more exciting
Yes to sex
Yes to sex
No to War
No to war
Fightin is frightning
Fightin is frightening
Yes to sex
It's so much more exciting

[Verse 2]
For you im a fanatic
Im a addict
Ur sexy antics turn me on like automatic
No need to get dramatic
But I gotta have it
(gimme gimme gimme gimme)
Gimme some of them sexual acrobatics
Kama sutra girl, anything that suits you girl
Stuff that you ain't used to girl
Come over here and let me show you just how Willy do it
Im a freak and u knew it
Ur a freak and I knew it
Baby lets get to it
'cause...

[chorus]

Its called the S E X X X X
(YES YES YES)

[Verse 3]
U take me to extasy
Witout takin extasty
Its exactly like extasy
When u layin right next to me
Im sexin' u
Sexin u
U sexin me
Sexin me
Its feels so damn natural
Wut we doin so naturally
Im likin u rubbin' me
And u likin me rubbin' u
Da passions emaculate
While u lovin me lovin u
I put L-O-V-E in you I love me puttin' me in you
Make love to you
Just like Sergio Mendez plays the piano
