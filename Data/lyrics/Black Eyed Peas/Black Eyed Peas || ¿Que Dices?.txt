We be fallin up like growin
Niggas don't be knowin our styles we be showin
Extraterrestrial complete show em
Sure, shoney men bring on the spear flow em
Up in the air, into their athmosphere
Let em know we tooken some shit right here
There's no way of knowing where we going from here
But we're prepared to enter war they declare
Motion to motion, we be like ghostin
Black Eyed Peas contain the rhyme with the potion
Got your emotion mingling with us
Any animosity now it's time to hush
Feel the f**kin rush

[Chorus (2x):]

Say what if you feelin it (Say what, say what)
I know you feelin it (Say what, say what)
Say what if you feelin it (Say what, say what)
I know you feelin it (Say what, say what)

Really y'all, here's how to be free
Just open your mind and relax with the Peas
Let us call our mellow crew, help you out to peep the ease
Like a thirty-five mile cruise, steady summer breeze
Run into your town, run into her town
Feelin my sound spreadin around
We spreadin around like the plague
I got you movin hips, necks and legs
I'm closed to the end
So push me, we magic like hocus
We be fallin up like oh shit
Some shit, that you won't see
Some shit that you can't lose
Some shit that can only be down by you know who
Whatever double the W-I to the L-L
For owning the extraterre-es-tre-el-el
Rockin you the cool-ass rhymes
The cool-ass rhymes, some cool-ass rhymes
Some cool-ass rhymes

[Chorus (2x)]

My job is to mainly hypnotize
I'ma take over the charts and maneuver through the eyes
Visually on stage, the Peas, we multiply
While equalling the sums of only one try
First is my scarf that presented of the pile
Second adjust my bust that really sound fly
Third gain the zone, the Washa has arrived
Fourth keep my mind and my song online
We purchasin dues that remain state of mind
Equipped with all cultures, a piece of color blind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
Keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find

Say what

[Chorus (2x)]

Say what if you feelin it (Say what, say what)
Say what (Say what)
Say what (Say what)
Say what (Say what)
What, what nigga
Say what
What nigga
