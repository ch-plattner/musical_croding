
Party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

If, if we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
I would drink and go out, out
With my boys party, party
On the top, yeah, that's what I do
Mac models, pop bottles
Live life like a sheep
(party)
Under do turn them
Every day of the week
Hot octane light
In the fast lane zoom
And the joint don't pop till
I walk in the room
And the DJs rocking my favorite tune
And they're shaking up the speaker like
Boom boom boom

[Chorus:]
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy

If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away-ay-ay
Easy
My life would be easy
Life would be easy

Party all the time [x7]

If, if we could party, party, party (hey)
Make that body down
Ladies don't stop it
Shake it round and round
Feel that bass bumping
And rock to the beat
This beat is steady bumping
They jumping off their feet
Check it out
Ladies got their hands in the air
Shake it like you just don't care
Party it down like yeah (yeah)
Somebody say yeah (yeah)
Check it out
Check it out
What?
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
What?
No you
Check it out
Check it out
What?
Cold party all I like to do
Is turn it back
What you gonna do?

[Fergie:]
Party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
(oh, yeah)
Our lives would be easy

[Chorus:]
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy

I don't give a fuck
I'm about to get loose
I'm a tech-ch-ch-ch
Just get drunk of Goose
I'm a live my life
I'm a party all night all day any time
I don't care if it's right
I wanna party, party, party
Party all day
Party, party
Party all the way
I wanna party like Aretha
We don't need no Visa
Party ariza
I don't need Juanita

Take me to the club
I need to dance [x3]
How about a dance?
Girl I'm gonna take you to the club
So we could dance [x4]

[Chorus:]
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy

If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy

Party all the time [x7]
