one two three..
like this..... ba ba duh, ba ba, yea yea, ba ba ba baduh
check this out darlin I got something to say, say
we could shovel love like all day, day
instead of all this lonliness that needs to stop, stop
I love ya down and put the hip into ya hop
you make it hard to put my egg inside ya roll, roll
lovin you is like to say she took my soul, soul
I'll break it down and let ya take total control, trol
I'm feelin you darlin, cant you see like total?
and I'm not tryin to rush like I'm russel simmons
cuz baby I cant stand the rain like michael bivens
I'm serious but you be thinking that I'm kiddin
I'm here for you unlike wives for your children
ill embrace them like it was one of my own
plus she raised em all alone, that I condone
but, all, this lonliness need to stop, I love ya down and put that hip into ya hop...

[chorus]
sugah sugah sugah I really want ya
baby baby baby I really need ya
looky looky looky I got ta have, have
if I want it, want it, let me get it, get it

[apl de ap]
hey baby girl I want your loving every day
cuz you be hittin in a special type of way
I guess your aura got me actin for the push
it aint the lust I got the apl on the rush
and when you smile at me you got me goin cra-zay
you got me up on sugar inside my soul
ill be the cup that you could pour in all your love
I wont spill it in a minute that you shove
instead I will withstand the pain
understand you is the main goal to aim
if you really need me just call my name
I'm hear all the time for you babe-ay

bridge:
I'm your love you my woman I'm your man right?
I'm your world you my woman I'm your man right?
no matter the problem we stay damn tight
I'm your love you my woman I'm your man right?

[chorus] [repeating]

[taboo]
and if I could i'd give my girl the world, world
a world without a war could ?unfural?, ?fural?
our love could stand the testament of time, time
till death do us part is that line
I could be with her till my son is 99
the love I feel for her is unbearably unique
being away from her, yo it makes me kinda weak
its like being on the desert with nothin to drink
