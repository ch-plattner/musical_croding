Some times I pick the flower
Cause I wanna know
He loves me not
He loves me lot
He's got to go

Not talking bout the dude
That's on the go go go

The situation that we got
Is so much more.

You make me laugh
You make me cry
But I want you
Right by my side
And if you go I could die.
You bring me low, you bring me high.

I build you high.
you break me down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me hard.
I let you down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

My therapist told me that opposites attract.
I wish that you was here with opposites attack.

You love me then you hate me
What's it going to be

Don't wanna miss the magic
That is you and me

You make me glow
You make me shine.
We always fight right on time.
And if you go I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

I build you high.
you break me down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me hard.
I let you down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

Sometimes we don't see each other eye to eye baby.
We up and down like a rollcoster ride baby.
Sometimes you don't see the way I try baby.
I hate the way you make me wanna cry lady.
I wanna fly away.
sometimes I need a break.
The way you treat me made.
me wanna go and say.
But I can go on.
with out you in my arm.
I can't resisted the way you used me with your charm.

You make me glow
You make me shine.
We always fight right on time.
And if you go I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

I build you high.
you break me down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me hard.
I let you down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

I build you high.
you break me down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me hard.
I let you down.
And that's story of our situ-a-a-a-tion
