Mira mira mira mira mira....
Mira mira mira mira mira....
Mira mira mira mira mira....
Mira mira yo quiero

Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em'
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero
Spanish girls, Spanish girls, I like em'
Girls, Girls, Latin girls
Latin girls, Latin girls
Latin girls, What's happenin' girls?
What's happenin' girl? What's happenin?

I like Latin dem Latin women (I do)
And they love me cause I'm that man
With cocoa nuts and chocolate skin
I'm that mocha masculine
Feminines that are Latin call ya friends
And call your cousins cause I know you got dozens of them
Marias, Elizabeths, Sonyas and Blancas
When I see ya you can get boned if ya wanta
Yo quiero en I'm sincero
If you never had an ichi let me be your primero
We can hit the channel we can dance the bolero
Have a shopping spree and you can spend my dinero
But...
I wish you was more like JLo
(my love don't cost) Cause love don't cost a thing
So why don't you let this king love the queen of Argentin
Girl you know I know you know what I mean
Cause I like them'

[Chorus:]
Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em'
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero'
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero'
Spanish girls, Spanish girls, I like em'
Girls, Girls, Latin girls'
Latin girls, Latin girls'
You makin me hot girl!
What's happnin' girl? What's happnin? (oh!)

Que onda
Que quieres con mi
Mira muchacha esta es para ti
Latina chicana por mi
Mas finas me gusta me a si
Mira ah, mira ah, mira ah, mami
Esperate, esperate, esperate aqui
We could connect and act humanly
Indulge in animal instincts so we...
We could have conversation or...
Sexual relation or...
We could explore find out more
About things that we done before
Whether it be kinky thoughts
I'm a make your chonies drop
Watch as this shorty rock
I'll make your trick drop
They call me cum a lot
I like em'

[Chorus]

[Fergie sings in spanish:]
Ven a mi,
El paraiso sera para ti,
Sera para ti
Sentiras el fuego dentro de mi ser

Latin girls, Latin girls'
Latin girls, Latin girls'

Que pasa señorita
You a bronze skin mama
Me a mama son I wanna take you to Havana
We could get down every day of the semana
Dance to the music and follow the guitarra

(Clap, Clap, Clap, Come on)

Dame un momento quelo vuelvo como peso
Take you to Philippines then you don't have to spend a peso

We got connection like a novel to Aurida
I can relate cause latin girls look Phillipina
Check your history there's no mystery between us
Destiny made it possible to be us
I know about your culture cause it's mixed with mine
We go together well just like
Beats and rhymes and
Tequilas and limes and
Celeste with pine and
I'll say one more time
I like them'

[Chorus]

Yeah'....
I like em'....
Yo quiero'....
Yo quiero'....
I like em'....

[Fergie sings in spanish till the end:]
Dame un poquito más
Lo que tu
Tienes por ahi
Porque contigo yo quiero bailar ...
(Mmmmm lamlaralo...)
Contigo yo quiero bailar un bolero
Lord caballero
Dame [x26]
Contigo yo quiero...
Sabor
