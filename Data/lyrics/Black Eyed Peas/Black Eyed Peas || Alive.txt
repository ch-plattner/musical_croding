[Will.I.Am:]
I got so much love
For you darlin' and I,
I wanna let you know how I feel

And it's true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you
And it's true girl

You make me feel alive I've I've I've [x4]

[Fergie:]
You said - you said - you said
That I'm the only one
You said that I'm your number 1
Now your gone and I feel numb
Tell me where do we go wrong
You are my best friend and boyfriend
Now it's seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't acting like I used to
I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why do I had to lo-lo-lo-lose
Your love your love your love
Your love is what it was
That have me feeling {bust}
{You are my true love}

[Will.I.Am:]
And it's true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do
I adore you
And it's true girl

You make me feel alive I've I've I've [x4]

[Apl.De.Ap:]
Hey girl your the only one
{Must} be my number one
Now your gone I feel so numb
Tell me how do we go wrong
First friends then we became best-friend
You used to be my girlfriend
Now your my worst friend
Yeah I gotta do a lil soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess it's your love that I used to
And I feel bad that I lose you
I get so many things that I wanna sa-sa-sa-sa...
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you

[Will.I.Am:]
And it's true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you
And it's true girl

U make me feel alive I've I've I've [x4]
