Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

We're trying to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we're trying to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin when I was my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private eyes girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quickly said shut up

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up

We're trying to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we're trying to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin crazy

Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
Cuz fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showin the love that you be givin
Changing up your livin
For a lovin transition
Girl its a mission tryin to get you to listen
Feel mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
"Who the hell?!?"
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up

We're trying to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we're trying to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin crazy

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

Girl our love is dyin
Why did you stop tryin
I never been a quita
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do better
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? Cuz it's the same old routine
And the next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
Cuz I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

Shut up

Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat 9x]
Stop the yapping baby
What happened baby
Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat 1x]
Is that all there is [repeat till fade]
