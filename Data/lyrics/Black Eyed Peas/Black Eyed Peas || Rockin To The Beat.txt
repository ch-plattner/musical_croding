Come the man with the disco gam
Step in the place and people are like Damn
Party get started with the cool on fan
Body get naughty and do all that I can

What is a band that can't really rock?
What's a MC that's rock on the spot?
What is a mic that ain't got no cable?
What's a DJ without the turn table?
What's a hot girl if she can't really dance?
What's electro without wearing tight pants?
What's a rhythm if it just don't bump?

Baby let me get in and give you just what you want
Give you what you need, Baby how you want it
Time to get nasty, Put your ass on it
Time to go on it on it on it, Time to go on it
