I cant make you dance [x6]

I didn't come here to stand around
I came  to get down
Tell the DJ blast that sound 
Vibrate the ground
Motherfucker just turn it up
Loud as fuck
Hit me with music, music
And I woke up 
Make me dance
Standin' in the b boy stands
Electro got me movin'
Call up the ambulance
I cant stop movin'
I'm in a trance
Deon beonce 
Standard phone make it fast

[chorus]
I cant make you dance make you want me too [x3]
Dance dance dance dance
How can I make you dance [x3]
Make you dance [x2]
How can I make you dance 
Oooh will you dance

Come on DJ go and drop it 
Move that body to the sound
Everybody dance the topic
Get them feet above the ground
Jump up and down to the music
Gettin' through it do it now
Aint got time to waste
This aint the place for you to stand around
Dance come on people
Move your body to the beat
Dance come on people
Rock your body move your feet
Dance come on people
Move your body to the beat
Dance come on people
Rock your body move your feet

[repeat chorus]

I cant make you dance [x16]
