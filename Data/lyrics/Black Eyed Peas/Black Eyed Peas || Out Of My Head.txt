You see this shoes
On my feet,
Im bout to go,
On out that door
And you aint stopin
N not goin stop it
Cuz im sick and tired of motherfucka argue

Relax myself
Cuz im about to blow
When they open up the bar
Ima hit the bar
I didnt drive my car,
So come on lets go

[Bridge:]
Im steppin outta here
Cuz where im goin, I dont know
Im steppin outta here
Cuz where im goin, is outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head,
Outta my head, outta my head
Outta my head, outta my hhhhheeeeeaaaddddd (oh)

[Chorus:]
Steppin steppin out tonight,
Got me goin crazy
Steppin steppin out tonight
Got me goin crazy
Steppin steppin out tonight
Got me goin crazy
Steppin steppin out tonight

Get some vodka,

When I see a boy,

Oh wait I think I know it okay okay here we go

[Bridge:]

Cuz where im goin, is outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head,

Outta my head, outta my hhhhheeeeeaaaddddd (oh)

[Chorus:]
Steppin steppin out tonight,
Got me goin crazy
Steppin steppin out tonight

Steppin steppin out tonight
