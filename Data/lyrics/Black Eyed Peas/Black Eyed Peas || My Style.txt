
Lord, have mercy [7x]

[Chorus:]
I know that you like my style [2x]
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style [2x]
We 'bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild
(So what you saying?)
What's up, what's up with you girl [2x]
What's up, what's up with you boy [2x]

Don't jock, don't jock, baby don't jock me
I drop the hotness, baby watch me
You can't, you can't, no you can't stop me
'Cause I'm a champ on the rep like rocky
And when I spit it try not to Xerox me
Got my style trademark with the copy
Right, you know my style is naughty
Right, so don't cock-block me
You like my style when I'm whiling out with my gang
And I gain my fame from doing my damn thing
On a mike and I turn the stage like cocaine
And I bang them thangs like a lover man

[Chorus]

Our style lined up when we team up
JT and BEP sold the scene up
Cali to Tennessee and in between 'em
We the hottest in the biz, turn the beat up
We be rolling four Hummers and a Pima
With sunset off the chi cantina
Stepped out looking fresh and clean-ah
Paparazzi put me in any magazine-ah
I got eight million ways to rockin' like this
And ain't nobody drop their styles like this
I'ma give it to you like that and like this
And my momma always told me "My baby's a genius"

[Chorus]

[Taboo in Spanish:]
Te gusta mi estilo (estilo)
Dile a tu tia y tu tio (tio)
Ahi viene Jimmy with the lingo (lingo)
I like to keep my style on singo (singo)
Baby you can call me mijo (mijo)
I make you say "Ay dios mio"
Tu chocha es todo mio (Ay)
I make it hot for you if it's frio

It feels like something's heating up
Timberland on the drum-drum he's beatin' up
Black Eyed Peas, there's no defeating us
JT, he's rocking a beat with us
Them freaks, they want to freak with us
After the spot they trying to meet with us
They know our style is fabulous
Off the hook our style ridiculous

Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da...

What's up, what's up with you girl [2x]
What's up, what's up with you boy [2x]

I know that you like my style [2x]
I've been gone for a while
But I'm back with a brand new style

Black Eyed Peas (Black Eyed Peas)
JT (that's me)
And we out baby (out baby)

Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba...
