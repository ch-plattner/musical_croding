[Hook:]

I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad

I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way
Call her 'til I pass we going out today
It was a beautiful Sunday
I had plans on going to watchin the matinee
But as soon as I step to the door
She hit me with some stuff that I just couldn't ignore
That she had to up and leave
'Cause I was a fool foolin her on what she need
Check it, yo from my point of view it was kinda whack
She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back
And for her, it's really beyond that
Talkin about she been through emotional combat

[Chorus:]

All the years that I been back
You were never around
And now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)
Let's stop all my love to you
Baby, I'm through with you
'Cause now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)

[Hook]

Yo, Will, that's kinda whack, I know how you be feelin
My girl's also trippin about the same reason
'Cause we out for two seasons on the road makin G's and
I figured it out these women there's no pleasin
Yo, Will, I feel the pain, that you're going through
She got you stuck on a yam and she's splatting too
Plotting on leaving you, yo, are you feeling cool
And if you're not you can always hang with the crew

[Chorus]

I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way
Call her 'til I pass we going out today
It was a beautiful Sunday
I had plans on going to watchin the matinee

And she dissed you, up and left you
Packed her bags and went and upset

She was like "I'm leaving" (Oh it's like that, now)
"I'm leaving" (She was always like that)

Check it, but from my point of view it was kinda whack
She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back
And for her, it's really beyond that
Talkin about she been through emotional combat

[Chorus]

[Hook (2x)]

I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout
