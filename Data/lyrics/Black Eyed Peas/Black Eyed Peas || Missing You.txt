I can't stand another night
Stand another night without you

Since you've been away
Everythings don't seem like they used to be
Between you & me
Cause I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love

I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love

Yeah yeah yeah
Everyday everyday that you gone
I'm singing out that sad song
If loving you is wrong
Then it must be wrong
Even if when I'm gone
Our love is strong
You're the one I want
You're my number one
I love you, not a fashion
I need to love your passion
But love is everlasting

Since you've been away
Everythings don't seem like they used to be
Between you & me
Cause I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love

I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love

When I'm out on the road
Roking them shows
Opening monical
Making you go
What a? you search
And glamorous
But I miss you church
Yeah I miss you church
I spent all my time
With you & me
My minds on you
Cause all I want is missing you

Since you've gone away
Everythings don't seem like they used to be
Between you & me
Cause I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love

I'm missing you
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love
I'm missing you, love

Without your love
You girl like? love
Can't live without your love
What's it like without your love
The whole world sucks without your love
Can't live without your love
Can't live without your love
What me without your love
