Let me see your body rock,
Shakin' from the bottom to the top,
Freak to what the Dj drop,
We be the ones to make it hot, (To make it hot)
Electric shock, energy like a million watts,
Space be boom and the speakas pop,
Galactic gone and miss the spot,
We bumpin' in your parkin' lot!

(Parkin' lot)
When you comin' up in the spot,
Don't bring nothin' we call pink dot,
'Cause we running around the clock,
Hit the lights and then turn them off,
If you bring that don't make you soft,
Like the jungle we run the block,
No one rollin' the way we rock!

Yeah, you could be big,
But,
Long as you feel like you're all,
You could be the model type,
Skinny with no appetite,
Short stacks, black or white,
Long as you do what you like,
Body outta sight.
Body (Body Outta Sight.)

She does the two step,
And the tongue drop,
She does the cabbage patch,
And the bus stop.
She like Electro, she love Hip Hop,
She like the Reggae, she feel Punk Rock.
She like the Samba, and the Mambo,
She like to Break Dance, and Calypso.

Get a little crazy, get a little stupid,
Get a little crazy.... (little crazy, little crazy)

I wanna dance, I wanna dance in the light
I wanna rock, I wanna rock yo body,
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride,
Up in the music & rock yo body right,

[Bridge]
