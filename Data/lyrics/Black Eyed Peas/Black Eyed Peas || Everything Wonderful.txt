
Here we go,
Here we go,
Here we go

[Chorus]
Hi, come on baby, here we go
Leave your problems at the door
Ain't no worry here no more
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful

I ain't trying to be involved with none of that drama
You can keep them bad vibes keep your bad karma
Tryna get my zen on like the Dalai Lama
If you talking yin yang pause like a comma
Cause I don't want nobody all up in my face with that bullshit
I just wanna live my life, live my life in paradise
I don't need no extra strife, I just wanna be alright
I just wanna be alright
I just wanna be alright
I just wanna be alright
I just wanna live my life

[Chorus]
Come on baby, here we go
Leave your problems at the door
Ain't no worry here no more
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful

I wanna live my life wanna let go
I wanna lose myself on the dance floor
I wanna reach your love wanna get close
I wanna make you feel wonderful
Come on let's rock'n'roll like a rolling stone
Come on let's go turbo o zone
Come on let's roll come on and get gone
And don't come with no problems leave them at home
I don't want nobody all up in my face with that bullshit

[Chorus]
Hi, come on baby, here we go
Leave your problems at the door
Ain't no worry here no more
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful
Everything is wonderful

And I don't want no motherficking drama
You can keep them bad vibes keep your bad karma
Tryna get my zen on like the Dalai Lama
And I don't want no motherficking drama
I don't need no motherficking drama
I don't need no motherficking drama
You can keep your bad vibes keep the bad karma
And I don't want want no motherficking drama
