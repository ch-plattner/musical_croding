Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Buckle up, here comes the shakedown 
We gon' turn it up, listen to the bass pound 
You got to react, high to the high hat 
Bounce to the boom bap, we gon' make your soul tap 
When we came through y'all was all mellow, mo 
We motivated a marsh pit like heavy metal 
Rock crowds from punk rock to soul 
And bring funk to monks and aunts and uncles 
What you getting good? 
We da real mother funkers 
Funk what you thunk we the ones that a funk up 
Cadillac trunk filled with B-E-P bumpers 
Now comprehend like ? thumpers 

Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Rock hard hard rock 
Bombard your whole block 
Reinforce my fleet, the funk is non-stop 
Dance stars dance hard, I'm back with Weekends 
Tied a place in your face with shit thats leaving 
Yeah we be the main source serving up the main course 
Don't stop, planet rock, light source by the force 
Bang-bang, boogie-boogie up jump the jumpstart 
Ignite to take flight we rocked ya depart (where?) 
To the third part (what?) it's a trilogy 
??
What you didn't know 
Ay yo we bring the bumps 
Bumps for your trunk and we making the funk-funk 

Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Yo what's up 
What's going down 
Let's start it up 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
To start it up 

Yo we up again, listen up 
It's the Peas with the sound 
We's about the break out 
Shake the whole Earth now 
Bass down up and loud whenever we get.. 
Set it off in your town 
Let ya know we all pound 
Whoever you are we gonna make you do it 
Whatever you do it just stop 
And dance to this 
This is the diggy-diggy-diggy-diggy rock-rock 
This is the diggy-diggy-diggy-diggy crew-crew
