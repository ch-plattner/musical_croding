
Let's get it started in here...

And the bass keeps runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin',
And runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and...

In this context, there's no disrespect, so, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks.
We got five minutes for us to disconnect, from all intellect collect the rhythm effect.
So lose an inhibition, follow your intuition, free your inner soul and break away from tradition.
Cause when we beat out, girl it's pulling without.
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out.
Burn it till it's burned out.
Turn it till it's turned out.
Act up from north, west, east, south.

[Chorus:]
Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), let's get into it (yeah), get stupid (c'mon)
Get it started (c'mon), get it started (yeah), get it started!
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started in here.
Yeah.

Lose control, of body and soul.
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow.
Don't get ahead, just jump into it.
You all hear about it, the Peas'll do it.
Get started, get stupid.
You'll want me body people will walk you through it.
Step by step, like an infant new kid.
Inch by inch with the new solution.
Transmit hits, with no delusion.
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'.
(Yo)

[Chorus:]
Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), let's get into it (yeah), get stupid (c'mon)
