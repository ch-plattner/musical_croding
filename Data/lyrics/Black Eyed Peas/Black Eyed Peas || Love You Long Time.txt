[Will.I.Am]
What would you do? 
If I walked up to you 
And I told ya how I feel 
About ya now 
And what would you say 
If I took your breath away 
And I loved you everyday 
The way I do now 

[Chorus]
Would you let me love you let me you long time 
Would you let me love you let me you long time 
Would you let me love you let me you long time 
Would you let me love you let me you long time 

Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 

[Will.I.Am]
What would it take? 
If we can up and runaway 
We can throw our problems away 
And get out of town 
And how do you feel 
I hope you know that I'm for real 
I ain't playing games baby 
I'm serious now 

[Chorus]
So baby let me love you let me you long time 
Baby let me love you let me you long time 
Baby let me love you let me you long time 
Baby let me love you let me you long time 

Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time 
Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time
