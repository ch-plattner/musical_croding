An introduction to a rapid ray
Will explode like grenade
Check the medical aid
'Cause the way that we parade the fade
Any MC that claims that they can be
Tend the mic when we strike precisely
We freak the level with the funk from the inner
Heaven, give me inner, black as I present a
Flock a rhyme that rock you off an ass
Powerful, power flows that'll leave your soul paralyzed
Yo, I respect that you be G-in (...in)
It's the return of MC-in (...in)
Yo, thank God for the season (...on)
And don't be tryin to think about a reason

'Cause there is no reason for you to front
We create cuts to give you what you want
Activate communication for the whole
Shocking your mind with rhymes

Doin it like what AP (Like this here)
Rockin it like what AP (Like this here)
Flippin it like what AP (Like this here)
Doin it like what AP (Like this here, yeah)

We do it upside down [8x]

Can I get a "Ha" from my brothers that be chillin downtown
"Ho" for the people that be in it what we do
"Yo" check it out 'cause we black and positive
I suck in negative from you

I got many rhymes format from the back of the brain
Interluding with the powerful matter scatter your frame
You fallin (Yo) check out what we do
We be all in on the microphone never stallin
Rhythm is my ride for the voyage of the mind
Exclusive rhyme patting us for what we design
I am my own Picasso when I roll
Rhyming is my art for my heart and soul
We positive when MC-in (...in)
Break bounce with the new blend (...end)
Original 'til the end (...end)
Sittin it all for no reason

They fell off at the attempt to elevate
They try to duplicate the art we create
So activate communication for the world
Shocking your mind with rhymes

Doin it like what Will (Like this here)
Rockin it like what Will (Like this here)
Shockin em like what Will (Like this here)
Rockin it like what Will (Yo, yo, it's like this here, yeah)

We do it upside down [8x]

We goin worldwide, across the nation
Now that we've activated our communication
Wantin demonstration, ask the activator
Before one more walk-a-meter, funky motivator
And I be the Will, APL from the Phil
We contain the hipnotical skill that'll kill
You dealin with the G-R-E-A-T
Black Eyed Peas guy, hella in a G
'Cause we holler in an energetic motion
With the potion I supply
Applyin to the beat that Alligator you combine
With me and my crew incredibly and super spectacular
With the rhyme one two
One two to the beat (Hop)
You can't defeat
BEP's production always complete
With this sounds activate online
And I'm on time to motivate your mind
Well I respect that you be G-in (...in)
It's the return of MC-in (...in)
Yo, thank God for the season (...on)
Sittin there off of no reason

We do it upside down [8x]
