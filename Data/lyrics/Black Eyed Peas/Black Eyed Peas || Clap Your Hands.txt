It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
Tell me why all these bumaclutz[?] try to clown me 
I tell em move away, me need some privacy 
Don't you know I am the man that come up positivity 
Never negativity 'cause we create then do-re-mi 
My name is Will I Am from BEP 
Black Eyed Peas, numero uno, we be jammin' like Marty 
If I'm technical with my rhymes, let me know now 
I shake it all around, niggas know how we be throwin' down 
Too much looky, who be ditchin' y'all like hooky 
Honey's wanna get up on me like suki-suki 
They call me on my telley talkin bout mushi-mushi 
They pullin on my body, feelin on my tushi-tushi 
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
And don't you know, I need some privacy 
Excuse me young girl, me need some privacy 
'Cause the Black Eyed Peas is coming woofin mighty-mighty flow 
I'm deliverin the rhymes because my mama told me so 
I'ma do what my mama say and rock dollar y'all 
Mama say, mama sah, mamu-makusta 
Too much looky, and we the last cookie 
Where pastry, dippin like, umm umm, ?le criste? 
Lickin on your finger and you lickin your hand 
That good, finish that man 
Make sure (sure...) make sure 
[Chorus:]
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands 
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands 
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands 
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now 
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
And you know, I need some privacy 
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy 
We open up, bottle killin, the business, showbiz 
We be passin the Peas, purposely and positive 
Wonder if is, where does it last, say "Here it is" 
Should be all up in your ear, with a test and a quiz 
See ya dance, say "Damn, now what it is?" 
Want to in sync with all the Pea body kids 
You be nodding your head back and forth like this 
They be feelin my move, then your mind is in bliss 
So put your hands together now we ready to bounce 
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced 
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce 
You can either jump up and boogie or just lounge 
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
I thought I said need some privacy 
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy 
Recite more poetic, a tactic from the attic 
Apl De Ap, gets critical and droppin' shit 
Like a dimensional picture 
You architect, so I free you to get the scripture 
But when it hit ya, I got you turning like elixir 
Back a glass of coniac, we divide the mixture 
I'm about to fix you up, with a new texture 
More information better down like a letter 
And in the sector 
[Chorus]
Clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon 
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon 
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon 
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon 
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
You know I need some privacy 
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy 
So put your hands together now we ready to bounce 
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced 
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce 
You can either jump up and boogie or just lounge 
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
You gotta give me privacy 
[Chorus]
It's too much looky-looky-looky 
Too much watchy-watchy-wah 
They looky-looky-looky 
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah 
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands 
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet 
Clap your hands now
