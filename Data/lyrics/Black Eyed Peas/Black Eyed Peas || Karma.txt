
Yeah, yeah
Watch out

Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running

[Repeat]

I'm the caboose of the wrong doings you produce
The wild tail of the tornado running loose
You tie the noose, I kick the chair
I'm the cinai that snatch your life while you gasp for air
The echo of the "F**k you" that boomerangs to hurt your loved
ones
The thief that held your son, held by ransom
The pervert that raped your wife
The hand that held the knife that took your life
You shot Tupac and Biggie
Now I'm coming after you like V-W-X-Y-Z
This is cause and effect, the dominal effect
The "What goes up, must come down" effect
You hopin, though, that you had a hand in doin the doin
The conclusion of the evil that you ended and start pursuing

Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running

[Repeat]

This is the payback from the past
You threw me down like I was just a piece of trash
You gave me cash every week just enough to live
But didn't get what I deserved instead I was deceived
Still young and didn't know about this in the street
Of the acts, so crass and shady
Don't crush your dreamshow and your whole entity
Subliminally you're on the hire from a slavery
Remember that "What goes around, comes around"
God is watching you and evrything that you do
Do you remember everything that you did before
The way the bad action opens cosmic door
I'ma leave it up to God what he got for you
I'ma leave it up to Him what he got for me
And he's watching you

Yeah, yeah
Watch out

Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
