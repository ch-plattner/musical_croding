I got these haters on my back
These haters on my back
Gotta get these motherfucking haters off my back
I know why they hatin' cause I'm sittin' on stacks
Now I'm steady chillin' and I'm spending all that
I'm a big beat pumper they rockin' my sound
Out 'n outta space I come from underground
Now I'm on top holdin' town ground
All them haters hatin' on the bottom drown

I'm a shotcaller, big big balla
Mash the dancehall, make everybody holla
Ahhhh
Block block blocka
Ahhhh
Ain't nobody hotter

Haters in my face, got haters in my face
I gotta get these motherfucking haters out my face
I know how to get 'em Imma get 'em with the base
Hit 'em with the rhythm Apl give 'em lil' taste

Oral politic systematic
Hit you with that acrobatic
Automatic rhythm magic
Here we come we right back at it
One more time do my team
Shinning bright bling bling
Hit you with tha bing bing
Like the way da beat swing

I'm a block rocka, big show stoppa
Aiming for that number 1 stop now we got ya
Ahhh
Block block blocka
Ahhh
Ain't nobody hotter

Eight arms octagon
Straight charm watch ya Don
Man I got the bottles poppin'
Party people got 'em rockin'
Yeah I got that ener-dope
Here's the doughs
Damn I'm dope
Check me out here we go

Here we go back for more
Hungry like an animal
High class on the ground
Check the up and low my style
Blazed up branded shoes
Jumping off like Deltah Blues
Here I come super cool
Serving you that new
Here I come

Here I come come come come
Here I come come come come
Come come come come
Here I come come come come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I
