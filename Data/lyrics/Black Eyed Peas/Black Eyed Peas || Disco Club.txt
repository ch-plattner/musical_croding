[Chorus]
If the lady's in the disco club
Are freakin in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then Take me to the disco club

Yeah, I'm trying to party on out
Step to the disco can't work it out
Let's get go and this party started now
Parties and getting naughty is what I'm all about
So many girlies in the house
With banging ass bodies and perty ass mouths
After the club we're going straight to my house
(I got to, go to) Gotta get you on my couch
I rock steady, no doubt
You ask for some of us so I let you turn it out
Don't give me drama baby, baby don't pout
I don't want a baby, momma, don't want a spouse

[Chorus 2x]

I like the way that you move (move)
Don't hold back, baby, do what you do (don't make me)
You make a nigga go ooh (ooh)
How the hell a woman get as fine as you (so fine)
I'm trying to holler at you (you)
First time I see ya' I was like â€˜hallelujah' (hallelujah!)
Turn around, let me view ya'
(Got to, got to, got to) Damn I wanna do ya' (oh!)
Baby let's get into it (into it)
Make moves like me and you was intimate (intimate)
(Sexy) Let's pretend this beat is a heart beat when we're intimate
(Hotness) Sex with clothes on
Dancing on the dance floor, getting my bulge on
(Rising) And I got a Trojan
Just in case we get it, get it going on

[Chorus]

Coz the ladies in the disco club ain't the ones to be falling in love with
If you go to the disco club protect yourself and don't fall in love
The ladies in the disco club ain't the ones to be falling in love with [2x]

Playa listen, yeah, I'm a Miss and I go to clubs and I sip on Cris and
That don't mean I'm like the rest of them tricks
In the party getting naughty, chasing money and dicks and
No, you got me all wrong brother
No, I'm a woman that's strong brother
Yeah, it ain't nothing wrong with a woman in the club getting freaky to the song

Monday at the disco club
Tuesday at the disco club
Wednesday at the disco club
Thursday at the disco club
Friday at the disco club
Saturday at the disco club
Sunday at the disco club
Every day's the disco club
See us at the disco club
See you at the disco club

We gonna break it on down
Rub it on your belly like a ultrasound
Shake it like a jelly and move around
Really wanna see y'all flaunt your style
Get wild, baby, get a little crazy
Don't hesitate, won't take no/maybe
(Move) not like an eviction
But me and you baby all cause friction
Hmm, as my eyed undress you
Just wanna let you know there's no pressure
Body conversation, they both want pleasure
But your girl cock-blocked and won't let you
Hmm, what you gonna do now
Bounce, rock, shake and we can all while out
Let it all flow like a river now
Check me, check me, check ch-check me on out

If the ladies in the disco club
Are freaking in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then Take me to the disco club

[Chorus]
