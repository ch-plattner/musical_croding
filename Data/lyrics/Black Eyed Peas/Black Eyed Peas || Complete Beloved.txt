My love for my girl gonna shine
She the one occupyin all of my mind
She the one that make my life feel complete
'cause I be like the lyric and she be the beat
The kind of beat that make me freestyle to it
Make me rock rhymes to it make me dance all through it
Yea, and I be doin it right
Time that I love her down's like every night
Everything about her is wow she fine (?)
She one in a million
More like a trillion
Lifted me up like Killian
Cupid stuck my heart like we just begun so

Baby yaaa, you and me gon be together most definitely
Always, be with you for the rest of my days
My love for you is infinite you're all I ever wanted

[CHORUS sung in french language]
Every breath of yours is my life
You're my life

My girl's like way past another one's
Ain't really no such thing as a better one
She takin me to limits like way beyond
Got me tappin on that ass like a Savion
'cause she all fine and stuff
Make a brother like (?) and stuff
Yo, me and my girl stand tough
The hell with (?) 'cause I can't get enough
Matter of fact, to hell with your friends too
They don't really understand the things that we've been through
I know we tussle but my love I'ma send you
Your friends can't wait til me and you is through but
You better tell em we ain't breakin up
The best thing about fightin is makin up
And my love for you is infinite
You're all I ever wanted in a girl, are you it?

[CHORUS & french singing til end]
