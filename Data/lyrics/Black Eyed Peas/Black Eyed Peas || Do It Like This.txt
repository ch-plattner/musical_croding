[Chorus:]
Hey bet you can't bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Hey

[Fergie:]
1 2 3 to the 4
Coming to your hood like a ska missile
Fergie rock the beat down to the gristle
I spit it clean just like Listerine

[Will.I.Am:]
I'm so official
That's why I'm rocking this, rocking this whistle
I'm in the disco
Percolating nipples
When I DJ I turn the base up to tickle
The girls with the big big booties
I'm straight chilling cooling out with cuties
21 and over, ain't messing with juvies
Girls always talking about
"I ain't no groupie"
I ain't stupy, I know what the truth be
You was up chilling with Yeezy last week
You nasty, admit it you nasty
Trying to act classy
Ask for a glass please
Grab a glass and get wet
Ask for some bubbles so I gave 'em MoÃ«t.
I said I don't want trouble
But she said she wanna get busy
Cause she dizzy
So I said let's jet

[Fergie & Will.I.Am:]
We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like

I said bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't bet you can't
Do do do do do do do do

[Will.I.Am:]
Do it like me, so fresh so clean
This beat's crazy, this beat's obscene
This shit's nice, this shit's so mean
Mean mean
You know what I mean

This beats crack
That means ya'll fiends
This shit's hot nigga'
Letting off steam
This is like movie action scene
Ring, ring, ring like a machine

This shit's money nigga, this shit's green
This shit is terrifying - Halloween
This shit is gimme your qu-qu-qu-queen
That means I'm the what what - King

[Fergie & Will.I.Am:]
Bet you can't bet you can't Rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't
Yo yo yo yo

[Will.I.Am:]
Rock casbah
Rock dance hall
I want pilates, someone gimme belly dancer
Who got the answer
For the Dancer
Nobody know but I got music to announce ya
Block blocka', Mama call me Papa
I stay on toppa'
Brick chicks like Shacka Zulu
I'm the shit
You the haka
Who are you?
I'm the future hip-hopper

Mega nigga', this nigga' bigger
Why hold a gun if you can't pull a trigger?
Why you say you do it when you know you can't deliver?
Why you drink vodka if you got a weak liver?
Ha ha ha ha

I'm a lover not a fighter
Love down a dike, turn her to a dick liker
Ha ha ha ha

I'm the big chief rocka '
Shooting up your block like "blocka'-blocka'"

Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't do it like that
Yo, try it, tr-tr-try it

Can't rock it like this

[Apl.de.ap:]
I'm the new mick matic
Black acrobatic
Alien 'bout to invade, galactic
Ladies climaxin'
Off of my accent
Philippino comin' to the US mashin'

Lazer flashin' big ghetto blastin'
Vodka, water, down for some action
Check it out now, the funk so brother
And right about now, you know I'm on that other
Shit

But you can't rock it like me though
Niggas say I'm dope
White girls say I'm Neat-o
I rock wave forms ain't
With no needle
Music revolution like underground Beatles

Yea, you can't rock it like us
Bitch, you need to shut the
Up

I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
Start the ignition
Let's blow it up like nitro glycerin
It's the new definition
Of love demolition
Check the new composition
Let's shoot 'em down with the killer ammunition

I got a proposition
Stop, listen
Cause this beat bangs, a banger
Knock 'em out to submission

I got an intuition
Tonight's gonna be a good good exhibition
Hope you don't have no heart condition
Think you can rock it like this, you're wishin'

You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this

You can't rock it like this
