In this context there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme you break your necks
We got 5 minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and the let rhythm effect

To lose the inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
Cause when we beat out, girl it's pulling without
You wouldn't believe how we wil' shit out!
Burn it til it's burned out
Turn it til it's turned out
Actin' up from north, west, east, south

Don't move too fast people just take it slow
Don't get ahead
Just jump into it
Y'all hear about it the Peas'll do it

Get started
Get stupid
Don't worry about it people we'll walk you through it
Step by step like an infant, new kid
Inch by inch with a new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it
