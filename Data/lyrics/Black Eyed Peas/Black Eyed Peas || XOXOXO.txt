[Will.I.Am:]
Ay girl you know you special
Wanna jump through the phone
Give you beso
I wanna hold you tight, never let go
Cause your loves like magic, presto
Girl, let's tangle up like a pretzel
Kama-Sutra loving baby let's go
Girl I put you on a trance like Tiesto
But I ain't talkin bout tech-techno
Girl you stole my heart like a klepto
Butterfly's in my tummy need Pepto
Bismol baby give me more sex though
It's you're pleasure like I'm Geco
Girl will I stop loving you? Heck no!
Honestly I think you got me in a hex yo
When I'm with you it's all perfecto
When I'm leavin you hit me with that text, and you're talkin' 'bout that:
XOXOXO, that XOXOXO, hit me with that XOXOXO, that XOXOXO

[Fergie:]
Baby everywhere I go
I'm not alone
You let me know
You're on my phone
You're in my dreams
You're on my screen
You send me X and O's
X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
X and O's
Oh [x32]

[Apl:]
I be waitin' on the phone for your text yo
I wanna stay connected like Lego
You're the gas to my car, you're my petrol
Me and you go back, retro
Everytime I get some, I wanna get more
Everytime that your away I wanna get close
Cause the lovin' that you give me just echoes
Got me dumb, got me stump cause the sex though
So good I wanna show her like an expo
I can't let go, leggo my eggo
You're my number one, you're my Pebble
You're the only one for me, 'cause I said so
Girl you won my heart, you need a medal
Cause now I ain't lookin' for the next yo
When I with you it's all perfecto
And when I go I be waiting for your text
I be missing your XOXOXO, that XOXOXO
Girl your so XOXO-lent, XOXO-lent

[Fergie:]

This is the mega love song
For the lovers

Love her

Can't leave her
Ring ring

We out holding hands
Doing lovey done, doing lovey done, doing lovey done

Knocking

Break it down to the ground
Love my honey down
Love my honey down
