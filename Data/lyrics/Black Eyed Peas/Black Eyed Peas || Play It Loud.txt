
I pledge my alligance, 
To rhythm and sound. 
Music is my medicine, 
Let the rhythm Pound 

[CHORUS]
And play it loud, baby play it loud 
Play it loud, Baby play it loud 
Rock the crowd, Baby rock the crowd 
And play it loud, baby play it loud 

I found a love, 
Its in the music 
Drop all your guns, 
Drop all that bullshit. 
We come to learn 
Inside the instruments. 

John Lennon, Bob Marley are my presidents. 
The sound of trumpets wake up people laying down, 
The drum and volume playin gonna shake the ground 
The violins will pick you up when you are down 
The melody will spin around and around. 

[CHORUS]
And whos going to stop us? 
Whos going to stop us from rocking with a sound? 
Whos going to stop us, whos going to stop us 
From b-b-breaking it down? 
Play it loud, baby play it loud. 
Play it loud, Baby play it loud 
Rock the crowd, Baby rock the crowd 
And rock the crowd, Baby play it loud. 

Hot beats coming from the city streets, 
MP3s via internet from overseas 
DJ's playing, you dance to 'em 
Swaying, staying up 
All night, zombie life 
I'll be your delight, Oh. 
The sound of trumpets wake up people laying down, Oh 
The drum and volume playin gonna shake the ground 
The violins will pick you up when you are down 
The melody will spin around and around. 

[CHORUS]
And whos going to stop us? 
Whos going to stop us from rocking with a sound? 
Whos going to stop us, whos going to stop us 
From b-b-breaking it down? 
Play it loud, baby play it loud. 
Play it loud, Baby play it loud 
Rock the crowd, Baby rock the crowd 
And play it loud, Baby play it loud. 

I pledge my alligance. 
To rhythm and sound.
