
Someday
I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday
I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
'Cause I know I'm a get it right
And I know I'm a get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day

I'm bout to get it, bout to get, get, get it
Can't do With little cause I'm big, big Willy
I'm bout to do it just like Bill Gates did it
Cause I was born, I was born to kill it
Gimme me more dollars, gi-gimme me more dollars
I need it bigger, I'm too big for smaller
I keep on walking like I'm blue collar
I'm bout to get it, baby, inshallah [Arabic for "If God would like"]

Someday
I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday
I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
'Cause I know I'm a get it right
And I know I'm a get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day

Breath, just breath
Now breath...
Drop it

I came here from the Philippines
In the plane with some big, big dreams
I left everything I knew behind me
Like my mom and my family
People tell me that I ain't gonna make it
I got a finger aimed at all of them haters
In a minute you're gon' catch the vapors
Cause in a minute I'm a get my paper

Someday
I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday
I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
'Cause I know I'm a get it right
And I know I'm a get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day

Someday you're wondering if you're really gonna make it
Sometimes you wanna know if there's anyone to save ya
I know you've been down before, like underneath the ground
Still got a little chance to turn it all around
Soon your time will come, so give it all you got
Don't stop believing, so give it all you got
Got, got, got, got...
