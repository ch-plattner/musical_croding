[Apl.De.Ap]
Your beauty is like 
A shining star light 
You make my heart skip 
You are my highlight
You got that aura
It's so angelic
You take me over
You're so electric
Your smile is sunshine
You give me sunlight
You're what I'm missing
Apart of my life
Compared to no one
One in a million
You got me going
You're my ignition

[Chorus]
Can't nobody love me like the way you do
It's a phenomenon
It's a phenomenon 
Can't nobody love me like the way you do
It's a phenomenon
It's a phenomenon 
You take me to higher grounds

Na na na na na na na na na na na na

You take me to higher grounds

Na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Fergie]
What you say is overrated
Cuz you made it up
You think that i am slow 
You didn't know 
Oh what you say to me
Is the bait into the same shit 
That you say all them o-o-oh's
Them other o-o-oh's 
You used to be the kind of the man 
That would take me as I am
Now you go-oh
Mr. go-oh
No need to stay another day
So I'll be on my way
I'm out the door
Out the door
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Can't nobody love me like the way you do
It's a phenomenon
It's a phenomenon 
Can nobody love me like the way you do
It's a phenomenon
It's a phenomenon 
You take me to higher grounds

Na na na na na na na na na na na na

You take me to higher grounds
Na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Taboo]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need 

You're my everything 
You're my everything
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You're my everything 
You're my everything 

[Apl.De.Ap]
This feelings crazy
I can't explain it 
It's so amazing
Feels like I'm dreaming 
This love ain't basic
It's like a spaceship 
Out somewhere far
I wanna visit
Like the taj mahal 
Or the great wall
You're a phenomenon 
You're a phenomenon 
Like the pyramid
Or coliseum
You're a phenomenon
You're a phenomenon
