[will.i.am:]
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
Yesterday

[Taboo, will.i.am & apl.de.ap:]
We going back to the front, give them what they want
Back to the past, retro glass
Back to the leader, back to reviews
Take them back to the future
Take them to the true school
Cause we was breaking atoms, live at the barbeque
Now we reminiscing, pumping Audio Two
Listening to niggas, niggas with them attitudes
Apl with some Black Sheep screaming
"You can get with this or you can get with that"
Smoke emcees, or you could smoke crack
You can sell dope, or you can sell raps
I sell dope raps cause that's where it's at
Now I'm back on the scene, crispy and clean hip hop fiend
Source Magazine, World Famous is the Supreme Team
SP-1200 drum machine, hail to Latifah she be the queen
DMC and Run be the kings, king of rock
My nigga Ice-T killed a cop
And we be to rap what key be to lock

[will.i.am & apl.de.ap:]
I'm cool like that, I'm cool like that
I move like that because I'm smooth like that
I rap like that because I'm phat like that
I rock like that because I got it like that
And I'm ill like that, skilled like that
Phil-i-ppines, cause I feel like that
I'm real like that, yes, I'm chill like that
He gots the chill

[will.i.am, Taboo & apl.de.ap:]
I got pounds and pounds of peas you know
I'm not Large Professor but I'm an extra pro
Punks jump up to punk rock'n'roll
The Master P-nut is a pistachio
The Peas peak past the pinnacle plateau
Posses a fresh Porsche, I don't push Peugeot
Packing out paper in a pass I was pulled
Get paid to rock mics and used to call the show
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
Check the flow yo, cause this retro
It's my classic mani-fucking-festo
Lyrically I'm magic, fucking presto
Insuring hip-hop like gecko
Making sure it won't stop, baby, heck no
That's a what, that's a what, the scenario
Reminiscing while I listen to the stereo

[will.i.am:]
I reminisce, I reminisce
I reminisce, I reminisce
When it's sounding like this

[will.i.am:]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to rappable
Cause oh baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Oh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

[will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo:]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yey
Comment allez-vous, parlez vous francais?
Adios motherfuckers, bon voyage
Home of the liquid flows and Liquid Swords
Black eyed killer peas on the swarm
Coming to your college and disco dorm
Y'all can't touch my skills
I can switch it up Das Efx and get iggity-iggity-ill
Yiggity-yes rapper, my style is unique
Iggity ice on my teeth, so it's cold when I speak
Word to mom, I'm in my own world
Galaxy raised, powerful

[will.i.am:]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday

[Taboo, apl.de.ap & will.i.am:]
So I can hit you with the bass, how low can you go?
I get lower than the midget doing limbo
I got shit that you haven't heard a while ago
'88-'92 the style'll go, way back, rocking on the A-track
Memorex, TDK, all of that, throw back before all the [?] rap
Willy is his name and the boy's coming, Straight Out of L.A
A crazy motherfucker named Willy
I'm so cold my flow stay chilly
I got a laser aimed at them haters
And I'm cutting motherfuckers with my razor
You too boy, if you fuck with me
I'mma dice you up, slice you up quickly
I signed to Ruthless when Dre dropped Dre Day
That's why I do this, to bring you back to yesterday
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday) Tiger style
There's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom, bam, I slam
Aw, man, you fucking with will.i.am
Cause I'm torching and scorching, my style is awesome
Cracking motherfuckers' skulls like it's porcelain
Ay yo, let's save hip hop from Dr. Kevorkian
Bring it right here, right back to its origin
Ay yo, I'mma hop in my motherfucking DeLorean
So I can go back and fucking perform again
Ay yo, I [?] some wind mills and some fucking linoleum
MC mic controlling them, I was like
I was steady policing them
Killing emcees, I was straight deceasing them
Compute-deleting them 'til them niggas don't exist
Because Black Eyes Peas is hard as hell
Battle anybody, I don't care if you tell
I excel, they all fail, I told them motherfuckers I'mma take them...

[will.i.am:]
Back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
And now I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
Taking you to the future
Take you to the future
Take you to the future
Future, future, future, future, future...
