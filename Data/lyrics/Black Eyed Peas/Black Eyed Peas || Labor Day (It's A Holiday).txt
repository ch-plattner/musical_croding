When I stepped in the room I bring the heat like the month of june
Crank the volume make the bass go boom 
Wile out like we some wild baboons (oOo oOo)
We go bananas to the toon 
I wanna throw bows gimme elbow room
When im out my cacoon im ready to consume 
Lts hit the saloon cuz...

Its aholiday pardon me as I celebrate
And thats the way we do it we get a lil loopy of the ignorant fluid
And act a lil stupid desication didnt do it and thats how we do it don't ask why we do it
Thats just the way it be lovin double Ds up in the ad
When I party in hollywood VIP I don't understand thats tle cuz

We party forever n get down together we don't stop n we don't quit
Lets get it goin cuz we know we gon celebrate cuz its a holiday
I don't work today or the next 3 days so lets celebrate
Cuz its a holiday I don't work today naw pardon me as I celebrate

Its time to celebrate serving up beat box on a hot plate like that yall
We on a festive date make it go ape n raise ur heart rate (oOo oOo)
We gon stay out late party till the morning n wake up late
We do it til the day break we gon on n on n on n on n (oOo oOo)
Dance to my rhyme I can holla acapelas deaf till ya blind
Ur mine baby take ya to the moon for your behind baby
Take u to the moon n just recline baby ??
We don't stop girl we don't quit nope we don't quit nope we don't quit

We party forever n get down together we don't stop n we don't quit
Lets get it goin cuz we know we gon celebrate cuz its a holiday

Move yo body n push it get naughty n push it cuz...

Its a holiday pardon me as I celebrate (oOo oOo)
Its time to get wasted n scope the whole place with girls with cute faces (oOo oOo)
Cuz I see some fly mommas so pack your pajamas but don't bring the drama (oOO oOo)
But u can bring ur melody I plug in my mic n sing harmonies (la la la la)
For how many times we gonna hit it for how many times we gonna split it
How many times ur gonna get it  
Or else u r gonna wanna come ova ur gonna have to water cuz im the alligator champ
Drivin the train drivin the train or u can bring a friend n switch my lane 
N get buddy buddy with ur friend mary jane 
She really blows my brain (brain) she really blows my brain 

We party forever n get down together we don't stop n we don't quit
Lets get it goin cuz we know we gon celebrate cuz its a holiday
I don't work today or the next 3 days so lets celebrate
Cuz its a holiday I don't work today naw pardon me as I celebrate
