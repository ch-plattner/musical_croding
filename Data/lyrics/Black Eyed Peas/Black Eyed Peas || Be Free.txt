
BEP, I know you feel it, huh [4x]

Oh my goodness, I know you feel the vibration
Across the globe no matter your location
Ain't no difficulty or complication
Just as long my niggas in the celebration
Celebrated the musical liberation
The Peas then demonstrated the demonstration
And you will feel the flush of relaxation
I'ma wax these and then get heavy rotation
I got you in bliss and ain't no aggrevation
When you bump us, we bring the stimulation
So hurry up and get your daily fixation
But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation
One dose should bring you to a limitation
So put your back into it, baby, that's right, huh
I'm about to plug in some dedication
This goes out to my brothers and my coalition

[Chorus:]

All I want is to be free
You keep pushin up on me
All I want is to be free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright [5x]

Oh my goodness, it's obvious now you feelin me
Envious niggas plan on killing me
Frontin on my niggas and also my family
Fienin for my capability, it's tragedy
My technicalities die hard like battery
Try to cross us, I blast 'cause you flattin me
You oughta be on something like PCP
To come against a crew like BEP (Oh my goodness)
Oh no you didn't try to contest me
Come out delivery, won't control your body
I'm breakin down ya'll mathematically
Yes mentally, physically and spiritually
Actually, I'm rippin your anatomy
'Cause literally you be in the cemetery
I'm about to throw a shout-out to my peeps
Dedicated to the DJ's that pump it in their streets

[Chorus]

Whip it good like DeVoe we whip it good
You understand (Yo man, it's understood)
We be winnin tournaments like Tigerwoods
Openin your suburbs and bump it in your hood
Rock it in your box or your hooptie-hoop
Bump it in your hot beamer 850 coupe
'Cause I'ma inform y'all on what to do
Hop in your ride and drive down in your avenue
It's bumpin in your barbeque and your venue
At a journey, feelin that ease, is why I sent you
'Cause ain't no stoppin this, stoppin it
'Cause we be rockin it (Rock, rock, rock)

Yeah, yeah, yeah [8x]

[Chorus]

Gather up the team, now we ready to go
Any minute we'll be all over your box and video
Niggas wanna stop me and my amigos
But we still roll all over your accapella goes
Leave it or this one here like meteor
Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar
Vibration that's headed for your store
For a change, not bragging about close to more
Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion
Relax and feel the groove it's the solution
We straight cruisin while the beat is still cruisin
You're here so clap your hand to what we're doin

[Chorus]

Whip it good
