Niggas wanna hate on us
Niggas be envious
I know why they hatin' on us
Cause not so Fabolous

Nobody got nuttin' on us
Girls be all on us, from London back down to the U.S.

We rockin' it contagious, monkey business outrageous
Just confess, your girl admits that we the shit
F R E S H we fresh, B E F, that's right we dep rock
We definite, BEP so
