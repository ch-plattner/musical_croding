This is a re-quest Mr. Radio Man 
Just one desire from a hip-hop fan

Tell the DJ spin it on the mix show 
Make a brother feel like im down at the disco 
And we gonna keep it going like crisco 
Cuz the DJ grab the record by the fist full 
by the crate full, and we greatful
When you hear the stuff of records get a tasteful
(Last night the DJ saved my life) 
Cuz of the collection of the records he saved 
To the direction of the record we swayed 
And all night through the session we stayed
