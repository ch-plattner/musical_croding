[Chorus - Fergie:]
Boy I think about it every night, and day

[Chorus]

[Will.I.Am:]
I just can't get enough [x4]
[Taboo:]
Honey got me runnin like I'm Flo Jo
Signed her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We are well back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin for her love, I confess I'm...
Somethin 'bout her smile and a convo
Got me high and I ain't comin down yo
My heart's pumpin out louder than electro
She got me feelin like MR. ROBOTO

[Will.I.Am:]
Oh baby I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feelin high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Chorus]

"This has been a switch up"

[Apl.De.Ap:]
Switchup! [x2]
I, just, can't (switchup)
Locked, sunk in your bed-rock
Heart, pumpin your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your head-lock (switchup)
Can't-can't stop-stop won't-won't quit-quit
Makin me f-f-f-f-f-fien, give it to me
I want it all-all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (switchup)
Addicted, I can't get, away from, you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (switchup)
I want your love right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory (... mory)
I just can't (switchup)
