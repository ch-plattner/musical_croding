Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
[Will.I.am:] (Eh... my people this is mega unstoppable)
Don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, the party

This is that original
This has no identical
You can't hack my digital
Future Aboriginal
Get up off my genitals
I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals
Call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical
Subscribe you some Chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me, invisible
I'm old school like Biblical
Futuristic next level
Never on that typical
Will I stop I never know...

I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won.
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it, stop it
You cannot stop us now...
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won.
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't stop us now...

Don't stop the party

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop,
The, the, the, the, don't stop the party.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop,
The, the, the, don't stop the party.

You could call me crazy man
Everyday I'm party'in
You could find me at the club
Pop'n bottles, minglin'
Ladies danc'in to the jam
Acting naughty, man oh man
Got me in the mood again
At the party, partyin'
Yeah I keep it happenin'
Taken shots, whatever man
Party like a veteran,
Music is my medicine,
You won't fine me settlin'
Can't be stopped I'm steppin in
Keep it goin till the end
Yeah that's right here we go again

I'm that one that lights it up
We red hot like fire trucks
Burn that roof, cause that's what's up
Tell the DJ turn it up
We droppin, that music, for people all around
Keep rockin', head knockin'
Cause they can't shut us down

Ain't ain't no stoppin'
We gon keep on rockin',
Baby ain't no stoppin,
You cannot a stop us now.

I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it, stop it
You can't stop us now...
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby you don't stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it
Now baby don't stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't stop us now...
