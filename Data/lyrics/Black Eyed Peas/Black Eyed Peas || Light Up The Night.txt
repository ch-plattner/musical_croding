Hey, ohh [x3]
Wait a minute 
Uno dos 
It's time to go 
Adios 

It's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
and we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
Baby it's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
and we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 

Wait a minute 
Uno dos 
It's time to go 
Adios 

Hot beats pumpin' out the box 
yeah turn it up 
Hot fire comin' out my torch 
I'ma burn it up 
Hot ladies walk up in the club 
Honey, what's up? 
Honey, what's up? 
Come on, let's go 

The big waist pumpin' like a thunder sound 
Honey got a bottom bouncin', droppin' low, on the ground 
Dropping low, submarine 
Off the floor, trampoline 
I got the fire burnin', blazin', bring the gasoline 

Ohhh, wait a minute 
Uno dos 
It's time to go 
Adios 

It's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
And we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
It's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
And we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 

[Fergie]
Wait a minute 
(I think we need to slow it down) 
Wait a minute 
(I think we need to slow it down) 
Wait a minute 
(I think we need to slow it down) 
Wait a minute 
(I think we need to slow it down) 

[Apl.De.Ap]
Big beats bangin' out the speaker make the earth quake 
I'm a baker's man, make dough and I get cake 
My status flatter, I'ma rip this shit apart 
I ain't sayin nada, but you know this shit by heart 

(Hey ohhh) 
I got these party peopole screamin' sayin' 
(Hey ohhh) 
I wait up on the alien 
(Hey ohhh) 
My mother know that I ain't playin' 

[Will.I.Am]
Wait a minute 
Uno dos 
It's time to go 
Adios 

It's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
And we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
Baby it's on and poppin' 
And we ain't stoppin' 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 
I've got it all in my pocket 
And we gonna rock it 
Let's light up the night 
Let's light up the night 

[Fergie]
Wait a minute 
(Hey ohhh) 
Wait a minute 
(Hey ohhh) 
Wait a minute 
(Hey ohhh) 
Wait a minute 

I think we need to slow it down [x2]

Hey ohhh [x8]
