Yeah, you know it
It's the balls
I know you know it
So sing a cause

Baby...
This is Awesome
And you know it

Baby

I'm ballin', baby baby I'm ballin'
Got phone on my wrist when I'm rockin' like this
I can see who callin'
And you know it

I don't be stallin'
I be installin'
I feel like Jordan takin' flight
I'm boardin'
And you know it

Can't touch me now (Can't touch me now)
Can't stop me now (Can't stop me now)
I go arenas, go so holla, oh my god
Oh my lordy, Oh my goodness
Lordy, mercy, You just watch me
Watch me like I'm movin'
I'm too Gucci
Awesome

Baby...
This is awesome
And you know it.
