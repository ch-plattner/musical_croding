[Verse 1:]
Lately, I've been stuck imagining what I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate, 'cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it when the light's out

[Bridge:]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus: x2]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh

[Verse 2:]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waitin' for me to errupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with, to keep both my hands above the blank-blanket when the light's out

[Bridge:]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus: x2]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh

[Bridge:]
Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably, lably, lably, lably-bly-bly-bly-bly-bly)

[Chorus: x2]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh
