[Danja:]
The one and only... Britney
Yeah
You ready B?
I think you're ready.
1234-4-4
Uh.

[Britney Spears:]
1, 2, 3, 4
Oh no, here we go
Catch me if you can
Don't move too slow
I'm on another level
Can you feel my flow?
See how good
When I'm on the floor
Wonder if you ever
Gonna zing that I got
I told you before that I'mma keep it hot
See how it is
When I walk up in the spot
Standing in a line
Ah, I think not

[Pre-chorus:]
I came to party baby
You might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You wanna feel the heat
Dance and lose control

[Chorus:]
Get back (Get back) [x3]
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) [x2]
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) [x2]
If you can't take it then get back
Get back (Get back) [x2]
If you can't take it then get back
Get Back (Get back) [x2]
If you can't take it then

DJ spin it back
Know that I like it
When you do it like that
Eyes on my waist
Boy, you better think fast
Got that kind of body
Make you wanna spend cash
Shake it like you seen them do it in the video
Ladies on the floor
Let me see you get low
Fellas at the bar
Won't you spend a little dough?
This is how I do it
When I'm tearing up the floor

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Watch me
You like it
I've got it
1, 2, 3, 4

Would you like it
If I tease you
Get you really hot
Watch me turn around
Then let me show you what I got
Baby if you're ready
Won't you step up to the plate
Don't be scared of how I'm moving

Boy don't play it safe
Let me see you move
Let me see you dance
Let me see you bounce
Danja, bring it back

[Chorus]
