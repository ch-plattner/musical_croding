By the record machine
I knew he must have
Been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
I could tell
It wouldn't be long
Till he was with me
Yeah, with me
And I could tell

So put another dime
In the jukebox

So come and
Take the time
And dance with me

He smiled, so I got up
And asked for his name
"But that don't matter," he said
"'Cause it's all the same."
I said, "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
And next we
Were moving on
And he was with me

And singin' that
Same old song
