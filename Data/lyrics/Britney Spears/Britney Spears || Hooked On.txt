My mama told me go on and let you go 
Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know 
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away 
But then I get the urge 
It hurts so bad (damn) 
When I feel the thirst 
It makes me mad 
I look up in my bed 
I look up and there is your face 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 

I heard it in the streets 
You got another girl 
Yes, it did sting 
But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok) 
You should catch me now 
When I'm in the fall of a state 

You're probably thinking to yourself 
This just aint me 
On the contrary 
I was your freak (I was your freak) 
Hit me one more time 
And trust me I'll be ok 
Hey 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 

Now I will be a bad chick 
If I rounded up my clothes 
And headed over straight to the door 
You wouldn't have a clue 
Of what you should do 
If I left you laying longing for more 

You'd be like baby don't go (don't go) 
Baby 
Want some more? 
You want some more? 
Baby don't go (just don't go) 
Said baby please listen 
Don't you just go 

Do you lick your lips? 
When you stand alone 
Well you got no x-ray vision 
Staring through my clothes 
Are you sure that you're prepared 
For what comes serves on its plate 
Wait a minute 
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts 
See my hearts on fault 
Could you pass my shorts? 
Don't you got a girl? 
Till then 
I'm sorry, you must wait 
Especially since I know 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 
Hey girl 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 
Hey girl 

You know you want it 
So come and get it
