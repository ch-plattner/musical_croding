
I'm coming down with a heartache tonight 
Only you can make it all right 
If I can be with you holding you tight 
There won't be no more in my life 

Every where I turn 
I see your face 
Reminding me of a higher place 
Every time you smile 
Angels cry 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by 
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by

(Every time you walk on by) 

I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here 
Every time you come too near 
I'm such a fool 'cause, this love is true and 
If I don't tell you someone else surely will 

Every where I turn 
I see your face 
Reminding me of a higher place 
Every time you smile 
Angels cry 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by 
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by

(Feeling lonely) 

If I ever see you again 
This craziness must find an end 
I look at you
I promise myself

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by 

Every time you walk on by
