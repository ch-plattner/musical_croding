
I..am here to testify
that your the only one i belong to
I don't know where to start
it turned into an art...not
to show the world that it was you
you made me realize, not to compromise
the fact that you and I should meet

(i know we're gonna get...know we're gonna get get)
bombastic love, so fantastic where i'm
completely yours and you are mine
and its gonna be exactly like..in a movie
when we fall in love for the first time

now i know why, i feel so insecure
i never understood what its good for
i gotta make sure the darkness won't stop me again
i can't sit and wait any more

you made me realize..not to compromise
the fact that you and i should meet
(i know we're gonna get..gonna get get)
bombastic love, so fantastic 
where i'm completely yours and you are mine
and its gonna be exactly like in a movie
when we fall in love for the first time

Its gonna be bombastic love
everythings gonna be alright.
when i am yours and you are mine
its gonna be fantastic love
when i wake up everthing is still the same
and you don't even know my name

[bom bom]

I know its gonna be:
bombastic love, so fantastic
where i'm completely yours and you are mine
and its gonna be exactly like in a movie
when we fall in love for the first time
(i know we're gonna get..know we're gonna get get)

and its gonna be exactly like in the movies
