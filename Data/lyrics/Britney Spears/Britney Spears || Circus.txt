[VERSE 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (oh, oh)

I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

[Bridge:]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins (hah, hah, hah)
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break (hah, hah, hah)
I'm like a performer, the dancefloor is my stage (hah, hah, hah)
Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same (hah, hah, hah)

[Chorus:]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho)

[VERSE 2]
There's only two types of guys out there,
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
So baby I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware

I'm like a ring leader,
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a fire cracker,
I make it hot
When I put on a show.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Let's go..(ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Let me see what you can do..(ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
I'm running this.
Yeah, like what..?

[Chorus:]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho)
