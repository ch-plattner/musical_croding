
Baby, I don't know, how I'm gonna survive
This fatal attraction is going to eat me alive
I'm not supposed to want ya, but I do like I die
It's turned me into a monster, like I'm Jekyll & Hyde (Jekyll & Hyde)

I just want your body and I only need a little time
To satisfy this craving that I'm feeling inside
I just want your body and I know that you want mine
You're taking over my mind

It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
'Cause when you stare at me
I wanna take over your body like, like, like it's freaky Friday
I wanna take you to a dark place
Make you, make you, make you do it my way
It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
This thing is so very
I want you so bad, it's scary
Baby, I want you so bad, it scares me

So scary
So scary
So scary, yeah
So scary
So scary
So scary

I don't wanna eat ya, I'll just make you mine
I'm gonna in-feed you, don't care if it's right
Oh I could just drink ya, till you can't take no more
I've never been so out of control

I just want your body and I only need a little time (yeah)
To satisfy this craving that I'm feeling inside
I just want your body and I know that you want mine
You're taking over my mind

It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
'Cause when you stare at me
I wanna take over your body like, like, like it's freaky Friday
I wanna take you to a dark place
Make you, make you, make you do it my way
It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
This thing is so very
I want you so bad, it's scary
Baby, I want you so bad, it scares me

So scary

It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
'Cause when you stare at me
I wanna take over your body like, like, like it's freaky Friday (yeah)
I wanna take you to a dark place
Make you, make you, make you do it my way
It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
This thing is so very
I want you so bad, it's scary
Baby, I want you so bad, it scares me
