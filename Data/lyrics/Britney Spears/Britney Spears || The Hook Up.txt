Said he wanna hook up
But she don’t wanna hook up
Told him, just go
And then she looked and said she wanna hook up
He really wanna hook up
Told him, let’s go

Baby, I can’t believe everything
Your body makes me wanna do
And the way that you move on the floor
Now I think I’m in love with you
Grab my waist
Wanna get with the rhythm and that move you do
Switch my hips on the floor
Baby slow to keep up with you

Back it up, na
Bump ya rump, na
Grab my waist, na
Work it out, na
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, na
Take it lower
To the floor, na

Get up, baby
We can drop a little somethin’
Ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin’
Take out, baby
Wanna get a little somethin'
You know, baby
Let’s hook up a little somethin’

Baby, I can’t believe everything
That I feel when I dance with you
From the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To the move you do
Put your body
Gotta get my body up right next to you
Move the party
Gotta rock the party until they’re over you

Back it up, na
Bump ya rump, na
Grab my waist, na
Work it out, na
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, na
Take it lower
To the floor, na

Boy, I can’t explain
What you do to me
My whole world has changed
I live in a fantasy
Tonight, I’m in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I wanna get in your groove
So, baby, take me there

The bodies keep shaking
(Wanna get) My body keeps shaking
Better get your butt out here baby
Come on lets go
So do how you do it
(Drop it down) Bend over get to it
(Make it pop) Back down to the ground
Pick it up, let's go [x2]

Don’t stop
Just get, get on the floor
Butt drops
Hips pop, poppin’ for sure
Who’s got, got it

One time, two time, three time we go

Bump ya rump, na
Grab my waist, na
