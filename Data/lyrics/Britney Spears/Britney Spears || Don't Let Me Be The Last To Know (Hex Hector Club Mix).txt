
My friends say you're so into me 
And that you need me desperately 
They say you say we're so complete 

But I need to hear it straight from you 
If you want me to believe it's true 
I've been waiting for so long it hurts 
I wanna hear you say the words, please 

[Chorus:]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know 
Don't hold back, just let it go 
I need to hear you say 
You need me all the way 
Oh, if you love me so 
Don't let me be the last to know 

Ooh... 

Your body language says so much 
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch 
But til' you say the words it's not enough 
C'mon and tell me you're in love, please 

[Chorus]

C'mon baby, c'mon darling, ooh yeah 
C'mon, let me be the one 
C'mon now, oh yeah 

I need to hear you say 
You love me all the way 
And I don't wanna wait another day 
I wanna feel the way you feel 
Oh, c'mon 

Don't, just let me be the one 
Don't hold back, just let it go 
I need to hear you say 
You need me all the way 
So...baby, if you love me 
Don't let me be the last to know
