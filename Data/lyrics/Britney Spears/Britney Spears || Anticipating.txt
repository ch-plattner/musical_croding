
Top down, on the strip
Lookin' in the mirror and
I'm checkin' out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
Were out for an all night
Feelin' so crazy cool
Vibe so right
Don't know what
They're ready for
Valet baby
Here the keys
We're about to
Step inside
Skip on the drinks
Head to the floor
Makin' my way
Past the show
My body's taken over
And I want some more
Woah yeah ay yeah
I'll be anticipating
This is our song
They're playing
I wanna ride with you
(ride with you)
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight

Step up baby
Don't be shy
I know you're feelin' me
'Cause you're
Givin' me the eye
And I
Don't wanna play around
Baby watch me move
Check this
Let's make a scene
Don't need to
Wait another
Why you wanna
Make me long for you?
Move it baby over here
So we can set it off

We can get down
To the DJ's sound
Feelin' so good baby
All around
Feelin' kinda naughty
Come and get me now

Woah oh
Ow yeah
