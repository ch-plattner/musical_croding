Lying in bed, touching my skin
Oh God I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?

[Breathe]
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to fade

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys
Will make love together

I look at your face, As I lie awake
My body's slowly moving closer
My hand on your leg
My mouth on its way
Oh baby, I'll just turn you over

Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, (uh) I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys (boys)
Will make love together...

Love together, love together,
Love together, love together,
Love together...

Do you like this? I like this
I want you alright
Do you wanna touch me?
I like this
Can you handle this?
I like this

We're gonna slow it down,
Just a little bit

I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
I just can't take it baby
Open your eyes, whisper to me..
Do it again, do it again

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys (boys)
Will make love together

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys (boys)
Will make love together

Love together, love together,
Love together...

That's good, do you like this?
Yeah, gonna slow it down
We'll make love together
