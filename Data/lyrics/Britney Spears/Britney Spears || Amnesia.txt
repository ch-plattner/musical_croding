
I saw him standin' there
In the parkin' lot
He asked if I
Came here a lot
And this is how
I responded

[Chorus:]
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend
Was the one that had bought me this bra

[Chorus 2:]
I get amnesia
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou
He's been with me for several years
I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over
'Til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't
Forget about me

I talk to my girls
I can talk to my girls like crazy
To anyone, I speak my mind
I tell them mother don't phase me
I'm not lazy
But boy, lately
When I see you, I stu-utter
Watch you slip away like butterflies

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Friday
We conversate up in my
Fantasies like, every day
But I'm a dud
Whenever you approach
Like yesterday when you just
Came to say hello

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

Me
Me
This is how I do

I talk to most guys
I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them mother don't phase me
But you shake me
Boy, you make me
St-o-o-o-op and stutter
When we touch, I melt like butter

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a
Thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let
Any guy get close
I like him so I'm gon' tell my guy
He should just effin' go

[Chorus and Chorus 2]

Me
Me
This is how I do
