[Verse 1]
You're so bright
Like a dream
You burn up
Everything
We might make a scene
Ignite gasoline

When the music goes up
And the sun goes down
Lightning strikes
And I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around
Is you
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
Heat wave
On the floor
Escape, exit door
Your touch, burning me
It's too much, gasoline

When the music goes up
And the sun goes down
Lightning strikes
And I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around
Is you
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...

[Bridge]
Damn boy, what you do to me?
Yeah...
You set me on fire!
Yeah...
Oh oh oh oh oh...

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...
