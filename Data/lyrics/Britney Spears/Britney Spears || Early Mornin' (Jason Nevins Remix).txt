Early mornin' 
All right, I was out real late last night 
Got a little messy 
Early morning 
Can't be like that anymore, oh 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Wanna talk to 
When he walked up someone grabbed him 
But I liked him to come here 
Kinda cool 
Baby, we can make plans 
Where ya live 
Does your mama live there 
We can hook up at the hotel 
Hands down so 
I told him, let's go 
But have a next guess 
But you don't wanna know 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Oh, in love 
So I approached him 
We gotta give him his friends 
There's something 'bout him that show 
So I said, what the hell 
Let's go 
Got up, got on the dance floor 
Hooked up with a guy named Joe 
When the music was fast and slow 
But have a next guess 
But you don't wanna know 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Call all your boys 
Call all your girls 
Call all your friends 
Let's do it again 
Let's do it again 

Yes, early morning 
Yes, can't keep doin' this 

I light your fire 
Your one desire 
Pull on me, baby 
And I'll take you higher 
You should try her 
So come over here and let's go so 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Call all your boys 
Call all your girls 
Call all your friends 
Let's do it again 
Let's do it 

Early mornin', early mornin'
