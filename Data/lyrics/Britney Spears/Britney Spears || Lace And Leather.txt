
French finger tips, red lips, bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss, can't wait for my sugar rush

Can't take it no more,
I've got to have more tonight (tonight)
This feeling so strong, I'm puttin' you on tonight
Alright, let's go...

[Chorus:]
Baby take a seat, eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy... on me, baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

Heels 6-inch, makes a boy want to bite his lip
Look but don't touch, unless you want to loose your innocence

Can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night
This feeling so strong, I'm puttin' you on tonight
Night, night, night, night, night, night...
Let's go...

[Chorus]

Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather

Lace and leather, lace and leather
Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus x2]
