I know you hear me on your radio
Well here we go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin
Hear me on your radio
Well here we go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin

There was a time
I used to think
That love would never turn into reality
I never thought
I'd find the one
But I tell I'm drawn to you a strength of none

You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch (touch)
You gotta look up to us

[Chorus:]
'cause your love is outta this world (oh)
And you bring me down to earth
I love how you put me first (oh)
Make me feel my every word
'cause I'm saying, you know this is about you
I keep saying you know this is about you
It must be
This is about you
I never felt this way
I know this be a song about you
Forever, everyday
I know this be a song about you

I'll be your moon
I'll make it bright
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light
And just as far as the moon from the summer sun
That's how long that I'll be here
And it's because

You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch
You gotta look up to us

[Chorus]

In my sky
We're the stars
I'm on Venus
You're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man

In my sky
We're the stars
I'm on Venus
You're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man

[Chorus]
