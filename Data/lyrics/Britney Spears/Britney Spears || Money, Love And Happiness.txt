
I'm about to go crazy

I know you wanna get in my head
I'd rather get in yours instead
Boy you knock me off my feet
This girl bring the heat

Don't forget to paint the town
I know you wanna hear my sound
Don't try to be too tough

Don't take this out of context 
But when it comes to being the best
There ain't no contest 
You should know by now my name's synonymous

With all the hottest hits I keep them breathless
It's endless
Boy relentless

People pay me complements (you're so wonderful)
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

You know what they say about money
That it can't buy happiness
I just need to know

Is this real or just a dream
Hold myself in high esteem
Picky about the little things
Come full circle like a band of wedding rings

Continuing living in the life of lux
Life sometimes, I know it sucks (it's real shitty)
Boy I'm not asking much

People pay me compliments
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes is common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

All I gotta say, I wanna be in love
I wanna run away to a place of
Fairy land of dreams, that is where I'll find
Everything I need to have a peace of mind, ow

All it takes is money, love and happiness

Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love... oh
