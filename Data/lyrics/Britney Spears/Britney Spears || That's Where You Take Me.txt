Oh Baby, Oh Baby 
In love, In no belief
Never found inside of Me
Built these walls up so high
Needed my room to breathe 

Oh Baby, Oh baby
You tear them down
Can't believe you've changed my mind
Oh Baby, Oh Baby
I saw your smile
Stay with me a while 

All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me

With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
That's where you take me 

I never fell before
How did u find my door
The key up to my soul
To you forever more 

Oh baby, Oh baby
You make me rise
And never did I once think twice
Oh Baby, Oh baby
You make me smile
Stay with me a while 

Ooh! 

All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me

With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky (crystal skies)
You are this melody
That's where you take me 

Afraid to let it all inside
Now I wanna hear you'll
stay with me a while
stay with me a while 

la-la-la-la-la-la ;)
la-la-la-la-la-la ;)
la-la-la-la-la-la ;) 

That's Where you take me! 

All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
That's where you take me
