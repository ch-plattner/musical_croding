
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

Wait till you have reached the age Blah blah
History has turned the page Blah blah
We still want to hear a brand new thing Uh huh
We still need a song to sing Uh huh

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow until the end of time

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

And the beat goes
And the beat goes
And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da
The world keeps turning faster everyday (everyday)
We still want to dance the night away

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...
[to fade]
