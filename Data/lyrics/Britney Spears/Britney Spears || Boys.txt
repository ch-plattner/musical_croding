
For whatever reason,
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time, it's over now 
I spotted you dancin'
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (oooh)
And the sexy hair
I should shake my thang
Make the world want you (giggle)
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do (uh) 

What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryin to sound conceited but
me and you were meant to be (yeah)
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice Girl
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world! 

Boys!
Sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys!
To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys!
And when a girl is with one (mmm, mmm)
Boys!
Then she's in control! 

Took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear
Musta' said somethin bout me (what you say)
Cuz he's lookin over here
You lookin at me (giggle)
With a sexy attitude
But the way your boys movin it (uh)
It puts me in the mood
OUW!
