Lookin' at me, yeah they are lookin' at me
I was true to you, just to find my point of view
Now you are lookin' at me, yeah you are lookin' at me

They wanna give it to me, they wanna give it to me
But I wouldn't go for that cuz boy I had your back
This song is all about me, damn right it's all about me (ya)
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Hey hey hey, so look who's talking now
That's what this song's about, me (yeah yeah yeah)
Hey hey hey, think you got me figured out
But look who's talking now, it's me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fast cars and bubble baths
High heels stepping on the gas
Lookin' at me, yeah they are lookin' at me
Dreamsicles melt away
I'm thinking everyday
Lookin' at me, you're still lookin' at me

I wanna give it to you
I wanna give it to you
But I can't go for that cuz boy it's in the past
This song is all about me, damn right it's all about me (ya)
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Hey hey hey, so look who's talking now
That's what this song's about, me (yeah yeah yeah)
Hey hey hey, think you got me figured out
But look who's talking now, it's me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Controversy is like a tickin' time bomb
Controversy is what they want
Please believe that's not what I spend my time on
Controversy is all they want

Hey hey hey, so look who's talking now
That's what this song's about, me (yeah yeah yeah)
Hey hey hey, think you got me figured out
But look who's talking now, it's me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey hey hey, so look who's talking now
