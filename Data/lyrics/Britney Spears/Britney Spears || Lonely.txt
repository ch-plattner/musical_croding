
To think I'm so naive
How dare you
Play with me?
I gave you
Heart and soul, yeah
Tell me baby, please
Why you screwing
With my head?
I don't think
You understand
I won't take your huh
No more
Don't knock on my door
Not this time
Because I recognise
I've heard it all before
And I-E-I-E-I
Think of all the time
That I've wasted
Think of all the times
That I took you back
Ain't no way
I'll be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in
Let's just face it
(Face it)
Better off alone and
I won't turn back
Thought that
I would be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in

Don't tell me
How to feel
Or say that
You're for real
My mind's made up
I'm cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl
Don't need no man
Says what she can do
What she can
Now I live for me
Boy does that
Make you weep?

Not this time
Because I realise
I've heard it all before
And I-E-I-E-I

I think of all the time
That I've wasted
I think of all the times
That I took you back
Ain't no way
I'll be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in
Let's just face it
(Face it)
Better off alone and
I won't turn back
Thought that
I would be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in

Think of times
You made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying
Leave behind this

What's a girl to do

[Spoken:]
Think of all the times
You made me sick
I used to think
I couldn't handle it
What you think
I'm just another chick?
Messed with Brit
Boy you must
Have tripped
What were you thinkin'
When you lost my trust?
You had it all now
You're left with nothing
Oh baby, now
I know you
Want my touch
And now you're lonely
And you still want me

Think of all the time
That I've wasted
Think of all the times
That I took you back
Ain't no way
I'll be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in
Let's just face it
(Face it)
Better off alone and
I won't turn back
Thought that
I would be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in

Think of all the time
That I've wasted
Think of all the times
That I took you back
Ain't no way
I'll be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in
Let's just face it
(Face it)
Better off alone and
I won't turn back
Thought that
I would be lonely
I don't wanna
Let you back in
