[Verse 1]
I've been thinking
Just sitting thinking
On why I love you
And all my reasons
And if I lost you
Boy, if I lost you
I'd lose myself
And I wouldn't feel the way I feel now

You bring me zen
Yes, you bring me zen
You make me feel like a million, billion
I'll let you in
But don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, no, don't you rip me apart

[Hook]
Baby, love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

[Instrumental]

(I don't know how to say it)

[Verse 2]
I've got visions
Boy, I've got visions of me and you
Happily just living
And though they're out there, them beautiful men
But you're my future, baby, you're my right now

If there was a scale from 1 to 10
On my love for you, it's a million, billion
Boy, I'll love you till the day I'm dead
So please, don't mess with my head
Please, don't mess with my head

[Hook]
Baby, love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

[Instrumental]

(I don't know how to sayâ€”)

[Bridge]
La da di
La di da
It's the only way to love
La da di
La di da
It's the only way to love
(To love, to love, to love...)

I don't know how...

[Hook]
Baby, love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it

[Outro]
La da di
La di da
It's the only way to love
La da di
La di da

(I don't know how to say--)
