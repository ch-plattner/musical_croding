I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the sa-a-ame'
Cause you ca-a-a-me
And you g-a-ave me, a pla-a-ace
Place to lay-ay-ay, all my pa-a-ay
Why you ta-a-ake it aw-a-ay?

You never know what you got till it's gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got till it's...
Gone, gone, gone, gone...
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone...
You never know what you got till it's gone

I try every night to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere I turn I see your fa-a-ace'
Cause you ca-a-a-me
And you g-a-ave me, a pla-a-ace
Place to lay-ay-ay, all my pa-a-ay
Why you ta-a-ake it aw-a-ay?

You never know what you got till it's gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got till it's...
Gone, gone, gone, gone...
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone...
You never know what you got till it's gone

Oh wo-oah
Oh wo-oah
Oh wo-oah
Over memories I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on, my heart is breaking
Can't let go

You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
