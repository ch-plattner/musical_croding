Baby 
I can be your sweet baby 
When things get crazy 
Make sure you come and save me (save me) 

With this fast car 
I can really get far 
And don't brake my heart 
Let's make out (let's make out!let's make out!) 

You can come take me away 
There's no pressure play all day 
Hold me tight and don't let go! 
Mmm Papa love you 
Mmm Papa love you 
You love it when I'm freakin' out 
Things get rough and there's no doubt 
You will always be there for me 
mmm Papa love you 
mmm Papa love you 

Stuck in 
the middle of it all 
To many people around me 
Can you hear me call? 
I look this way 
And you're not there 
If you dont mind 
My soul out there 

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa 

You can come take me away 
There's no pressure play all day 
Hold me tight and don't let go! 
Mmm Papa love you 
Mmm Papa love you 
You love it when I'm freakin' out 
Things get rough and there's no doubt 
You will always be there for me 
Mmm Papa love you 
Mmm Papa love you 

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi 
Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi 
Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi 

You love it when I'm freakin' out 
Things get and there's no doubt 
You love it when I'm freakin' out 
Things get and there's no doubt 

You can come take me away 
There's no pressure play all day 
Hold me tight and don't let go! 
Mmm Papa love you 
Mmm Papa love you 
You love it when I'm freakin' out 
Things get rough and there's no doubt 
You will always be there for me 
Mmm Papa love you 
Mmm Papa love you 

Now see 
I'm mommy 
And that make you Papi 
And that makes us Luvi 

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa 
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa 
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa
