
So curious, so curious.
I’m so curious, about our love. 
I don’t understand, why you don’t take my hand,
And tell me you care. I see all the signs, 
But if you wanna be mine, don’t leave me up in the air.

Oh baby
You better let your love show, here’s what I’m telling you 
Let me know or let me go:
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do?

So curious, so curious.
I’m so curious, about our love.
If its make believe,
Why don’t you set my heart free?
And tell me goodbye.
But if it’s for real, tell me you feel for me
Way deep down inside.

Oh baby
Is this goodbye or hello? Here’s what I’m telling you
Let me know or let me go:
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do?

So curious 
All day all night I just dream of you
I think about all the things that we could do
I’m dying for and I’m living for the day
When you could have been up 
And say you feel the same you feel like I do

 I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do? [x2]
