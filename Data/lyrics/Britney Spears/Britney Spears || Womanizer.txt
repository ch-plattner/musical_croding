Superstar
Where you from, hows it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin more than just re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, Woman, Womanizer
You're a Womanizer, oh Womanizer oh
You're a Womanizer, baby
You you you are, You you you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
You got me goin'
You're oh so charmin'
But I can do it
Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothin' but a
Womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of champion
Too bad for you
You just cant find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are
That's just who you are, baby

Lollipop
Must mistake me, you're a sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, Woman, Womanizer
You're a Womanizer, oh Womanizer oh
You're a Womanizer, baby
You you you are, You you you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
You got me goin'
You're oh so charmin'
But I can do it
You Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
Boy, don't try to front
I know just what you are
You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothin' but a
Womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl, but I can't cause we don't

Womanizer, Woman, Womanizer
You're a Womanizer, oh Womanizer oh

You you you are, you you you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer
(Womanizer)
