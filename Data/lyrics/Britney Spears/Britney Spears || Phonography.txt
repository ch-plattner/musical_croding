
We're not so different
You and me
'Cause we both
Share our share of obscenities
And everybody's
Got some freaky tendencies
Hidden or admitted
'Cause we all got needs

And I make no apologies (Huh-huh)
I'm into phonography (Huh-huh)
And I like my bluetooth, buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free (Huh-huh)
Then I let my mind roam (Huh-huh)
Playin' with my ringtone
He got service, I've got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

I can follow
All your commands
But there will be no talk of
Adding you to my plan
I'll keep you connected
Long as you understand
That's how we should keep it
Mr. Telephone Man

And I make no apologies (Huh-huh)
I'm into phonography (Huh-huh)
And I like my bluetooth, buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free (Huh-huh)
Then I let my mind roam (Huh-huh)
Playin' with my ringtone
He got service, I've got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

Baby, if you're not alone
Take me off speakerphone
What I'm 'bout to say right here
Is just for your ears to hear
If you need to
Hit me back, hit me back
I got a star 69
For that shit, for that shit (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

Phonography
Phonography
(Go)
