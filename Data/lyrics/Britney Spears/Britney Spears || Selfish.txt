La, la, la
Okay, you think you got me where you want me

And tonight you gon' be my be my man

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes
I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes
I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little selfish

Just lay right there and don't you move
I'm in control tonight

Lock you up in my room
Be my prisoner of love tonight
La, la, la
Shut up, sit down

And tonight you gon be my be my man

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes

[Bridge:]
Tonight I'm feeling sexual
Come on and play inside my love below
Strip down and give me my own private show
I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Tonight I'm feeling sexual
Come on and play inside my love below
Strip down and give me my own private show
I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish

Boom, boom, baby
Got you up in my Mercedes
I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little

Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes.
I'm a be a little selfish...
Be a- be a- be a...

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes
I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby
Pick you up in my Mercedes
I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little selfish
