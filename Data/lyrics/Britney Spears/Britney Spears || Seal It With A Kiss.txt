[Verse 1]
See you all tonight smiling and talking
We can be polite, when we know they're watching
But I want you like that
Yeah, I want you like that
Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I want you like that

Say you're just a friend, I'm a little liar
When we play pretend body is on fire
'Cause I like it like that
Yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it like that

[Chorus]
Come here closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep the secret me and you
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh

In the shadows where it's hot
Know the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh

[Verse 2]
When you look at me
There is no mistaking
Like telepathy
I know what you thinking
That you want me like that
Yeah, you want me like that
Yeah, you want me
Yeah, you want me
Yeah, you want me like that

Ultraviolet light
Burning hot like you do
Can we synchronize?
Meet me in the back room
'Cause I like it like that,
Yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it like that

[Chorus]
Come here closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep the secret me and you
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh

In the shadows where it's hot
Know the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh

[Bridge]
Say you're just a friend
I'm a little liar

[Chorus]
Come here closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep the secret me and you
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh

In the shadows where it's hot
Know the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss
Ooooh ooooh ooooh
