
It's a crazy little thing called mad love
It goes something like this

Tangled up in you, uh
Twisted like I've never been before
I don't know what you do
All I know is I want a little more

I don't care if the way that I act doesn't make much sense
When you're near, something in me reacts and there's no defense
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
Oh

I wanna take you in (Come here)
A velvet rush is running through mad veins
Like adrenaline, a kiss from you and I'm going so insane
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than my love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
