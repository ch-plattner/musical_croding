[Intro x7: Will.I.am]
Big fat bass
The big fat bass

[Chorus: x3]
I can be the treble Baby
You can be the bass
You can be the bass
You can be the bass

[Verse 1: Britney]
Hey, you see down on the floor
I want you to take me higher
Till I can't take it no more

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger)

And now, you see up on the sky
I was rocking the bottom
Now look at me I can fly

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger)

[Chorus x2]

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger) [x4]

[Will.I.am:] {It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger}

[Verse 2: Britney]
Hey, you see out in the night
Wanna go out dancing
So I can feel alright

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger)

Yo, take me out to the lights
I wanna have me a good time

The bass is feelin' nice

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger)

[Chorus x4]

[Rap Verse: Will.I.am]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

It's a kick drum, come and get some
The sound that's rocking your system
When it pounds, it cause an addiction
Y'all better have a prescription
Me and Brit got the whole club trippin'
They sit and wait and listen

For the kick drum, for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

For the big big fat fat bass
Rocking all in your face
Vibration got the place
Right now let's get crazy

Here we go, Here we go
Everybody in the place get frantic
This beat right here's beat is gigantic

(It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger) [x4]

[Chorus x4]
