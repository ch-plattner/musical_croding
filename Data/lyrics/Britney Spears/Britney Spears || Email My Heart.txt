
It's been hours seems like days, since you went away,
And all I do is check the screen to see if you're ok.
You don't answer when I phone, guess you wanna be left alone.
So I'm sending my heart, my soul, and this is what I'll say:

[CHORUS]
I'm sorry, oh so sorry, can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to you.
E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
and that I know you're out there and I know that you still care.
Email me back and say our love will stay alive.
Forever, Email my heart.

Whoa
I can see you in my mind, coming on the line
And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times.
Here's a picture of us two, I look so good on you
and can't you please forgive me for the hurt I put you through.

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm sorry, oh so sorry, can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to (you).

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
and that I know you're out there and I know that you still care
(I know that you still care...)
Email me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever (Won't ya say, Won't ya say)
Forever, Forever
Email my heart
