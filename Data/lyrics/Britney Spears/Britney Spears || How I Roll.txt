Burn it all down
Need to buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Knee socks
Drink tequila on the rocks
Till you make your body pops to the speaker

Burn it all down
Need to buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Show your knee socks
drink tequila on the rocks
Till you make your body pops to the speaker

(I wanna go) downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) nine lives like a kitty cat
(You wanna roll, that's how I roll)
(I wanna go) bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) my thing if you wanna taste
(You better know, that's how I roll)

Feel the earthquake
Gonna make your body shake
Till the circuits starts to break in the speaker
Can we get fly
Helicopter in the sky
'Cause we turn it up high in the speaker

If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my thug tonight
We can tear it up tonight

(I wanna go) downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) nine lives like a kitty cat
(You wanna roll, that's how I roll)
(I wanna go) bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) my thing if you wanna taste
(You better know, that's how I roll)

Shimmy shimmy oh
Shimmy oh shimmy hey
We can give them what they want
And we can take it away
Try love tonight
We can tear it up tonight

If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my thug tonight
We can tear it up tonight

(I wanna go) downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) nine lives like a kitty cat
(You wanna roll, that's how I roll)
(I wanna go) bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) my thing if you wanna taste
(You better know, that's how I roll)
