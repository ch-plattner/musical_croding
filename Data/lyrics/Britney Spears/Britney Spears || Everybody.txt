So precocious
Assuming that your into me
So fierce the way
You pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire
Boy come on and rescue me

When I see you
I need you right away
(Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behavin'
It's got a hold of me
Grabbing me, rapidly
Romantic dancing
Dreams are made of this, yeah

Everybody
Come on get to jumpin'
Everybody
Movin' next to somethin'
Everybody
Feel the temperature risin'
Everybody

It's so real to feel your samba next to me

So intense when
You sense in my vicinity
Body shakin'
Achin' I can take
How I want you so bad
Boy that I can taste it now

Lovers get wild
Start flashing your money
Ladies go crazy
And act a fool
Everybody get down
And do what you want to
The night is still young
To be seduced

Taking in every little thing I see
Triple tie dancing
With the tab complete
Little boys dancing
Cause they feeling me
Sweating cold, fretting
It's the place to be
Come and sit with me
Come and sit with me
Sit back, you'll see it so beautifully
Loving everybody, baby, is all you need
Let go of the way things used to be

Everybody
Come on get to jumpin'
(Let your body move it)
Everybody
Movin' next to somethin'
Everybody
Feel the temperature risin'
Everybody

Everybody
Movin' next to somethin'
Everybody
Feel the temperature risin'
Everybody
Come on let's keep gridin'

Everybody
