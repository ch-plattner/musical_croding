
I'm just a girl with a crush on you 

Don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me still
If only I could trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I have it all

[CHORUS:]
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I have been through changes, yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I just have it all

[Repeat CHORUS]

Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all

Can't make you, make you love me baby
It's my life, what can I do?
Can't make you love me, alright
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm just a girl with a crush on you
