
Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win 

I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[CHORUS:]
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go

I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity

But, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Repeat CHORUS]

I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just want to know

[Repeat CHORUS]
