
I can't believe I'm falling again
Just when I thought never again
Something by the way you make me innocent again
Now you're here making me yours
Like all I have was made to be yours
Like everything that came before
Was waiting to be yours

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken.

All my stars are coming undone
When you got me coming undone
Like all the damage to my heart is finally undone

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

It's cause you say it like you mean it
It's cause you say it and I believe it
It's kind of like I saved it all up
I saved it all for you

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken
