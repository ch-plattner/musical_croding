Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges (I like 'em rough)
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (know)

I'm checking it so hot (so hot)
I Wonder if he knows he's on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
And if I notice you I know it's you. Choose you don't wanna lose you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)

When you walk (when you walk) and when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader.. try to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I cant handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan..

I don't think you know (know)

I'm checking it so hot (so hot)
