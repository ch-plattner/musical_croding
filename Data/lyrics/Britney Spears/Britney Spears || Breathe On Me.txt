It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air.
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds.
One love united
Two bodies synchronising
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe, oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (it's a way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby 
Just, breathe on me.
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me), oh baby 
Just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)
We don't need to touch
Just breathe

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow

Breathe, breathe, oh

Breathe on me (oh oh) oh
Baby just, breathe on me (on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) oh
Baby just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)
We don't need to touch, just
