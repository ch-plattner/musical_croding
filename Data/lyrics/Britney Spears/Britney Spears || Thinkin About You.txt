Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear

I spend my days (ooh, ooh)
With you (I spend my days)
I spend my nights (my nights)
thinkin' about you (thinking about you babe)
I spend my days (all day, all night)
With you (with you)
I spend my nights (my nights)
thinkin' about you

You stay on my mind, oh
And i think about you all the time (all the time)
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight, ooh
Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night that I spend without you
Is longer than the last

I spend my days (I spend my days)
With you (thinking about you babe)
I spend my nights (my nights)
thinkin' about you (all day, all night)
I spend my days (my days)
With you (thinking about you)
I spend my nights (my nights)
Thinkin' about you (thinking about you babe)

Ooh, you know I can't get enough of you (can't get enough yeah)
Uh-uh, you know that 24 hours won't ever, ever do (yeah yeah)
I spend my days, with you (with you, with you)
I spend my nights thinkin' about you
I spend my days with you (with you baby)
I spend my nights (all day, all night) thinkin' about you (all day, all night)
I spend my days (thinking about you) with you (thinking about you)
I spend my nights (I spend my days, oh yeah) thinkin' about you
I spend my days (with you) with you (thinking about you)
I spend my nights (thinking about you baby) Thinkin' about you
I spend my days (all day, all night)
With you (all day, all night)
