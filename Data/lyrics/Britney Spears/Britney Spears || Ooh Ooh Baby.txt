
The way you smile, the way you taste
You know I have an appetite for sexy things
All you do is look at me, it's a disgrace
What's running through my mind is you,
Up in my face
yeah, yeah

Your voice is like music to my ears,
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears
Take me high and just wipe away my fears,
When you're with me
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that i hear

Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and i come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah

You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up with your love

The more you move,
The more I tense
It's like you got me hypnotised
I'm in a trance
Your jersey fits
It's right at home, between my hands
And now I hope you know that I'm
Your biggest fan
yeah, yeah

Your voice is like music to my ears,
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears
Take me high and just wipe away my fears,
When you're with me
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that i hear

Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and i come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside

Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah

You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up
You're fillin me up with your love

You got something that I really want and
Come here, oh we don't even have to talk and
Lay back, and let me tell you what I'm thinking
Cause I like you, Cause I like you
