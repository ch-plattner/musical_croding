
Nothin` seems to be the way 
That it used to 
Everything seems shallow 
God give me truth, In me 
and tell me somebody`s watching 
Over me 
And that is all I pray is that 

Someday I will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what`s He`s done to me 
Oh but maybe 
Someday I will breathe 
And I`ll finally see 
See it all in my baby 

Don`t you run too fast my dear 
Why don`t you stop 
Just stop and listen to your tears 
They`re all you`ve got 

It`s in you 
You see somebody`s watching 
Over You 
And that is all I pray is that 

Someday you will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what he does to you 
Oh but baby 
Someday you will breathe 
And you`ll finally see 
You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby 

No moment will be more true 
Than the moment 
I look at you 

It`s in you 
You see somebody`s watching 
over you 
and that is all I pray is that 

Someday you will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what He does to you 
Oh but maybe 
Someday you will breathe 
And you`ll finally see 
You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby 

You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby...
