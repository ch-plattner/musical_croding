[Britney]
Yeah
Yeah
Would you rather I dim the lights
Would you prefer, just like we were
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)
However may I pleasure you

Fill with bubbles
Warm you a bath
Lay back relax
Anything you ask
Let me release the stress for you
However may I pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
You’re so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight I’m at your service
I’m so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
(Hey Britney, it’s Don Phillip)

[Don Philip]
Any fantasy can occur
Will be observed
Just say the word
I’ll do it if you want me to
Whatever just to pleasure you
If you wanna get off from that
Lay on your back
I got the max
Certainly I’ll pull you through
Whatever just to pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
You’re so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight I’m at your service
I’m so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

[Bridge]
If I
Pleasure
Together
Whatever
Whenever
Baby, with you

And it’s Like
Heaven
Together
No matter
Whatever
As long as you ask me too (what do you want me to do)

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
