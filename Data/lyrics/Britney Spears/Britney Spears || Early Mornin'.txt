
Early mornin'
Alright, I was a little late last night
Got a little messy
Early morning
Can't be like that anymore, oh

[Chorus:]
I was shaking my ass in the streets I'm wrong and
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early morning
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early morning

Met a dark dude, kinda dark hair
When he walked up Tony grabbed him
But I liked him, told him "Come here"
Kinda cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where ya live?
Does your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
Hands down so
I told him, "Let's go"
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]

Oh, in love
I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
He was talkin' bout hittin' up show
So I said, what the hell
Let's go
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
But what happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it again

Yes, early morning
Yes, can't keep doin' this

I'll light your fire
Your one desire
Pull on me, baby
And I'll take you higher
[Man:] I wanna get with you
You should try her
So come over here and let's go so

[Chorus]

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it

Early mornin', early mornin'
