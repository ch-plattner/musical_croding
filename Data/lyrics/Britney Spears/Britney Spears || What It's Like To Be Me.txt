Do you know what it's like?
C'mon, C'mon

[Britney:]
Baby Tell me 
Do I...
Look like the kinda girl
That you wanna take me home
Wanna make me your own
Do you even know what I like 
Just what I'm living for,
What I adore 
Baby, take the time to realize I'm
not the kind to sacrifice
The way I am
So if you wanna be my man (baby) 

[Britney & Justin:]
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you wanna stay around (I’m telling you)
You’ve got to figure me out
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Baby You don't know
What It's like to be me 

[Justin:]

[Britney:]
Don't you get it twisted boy

But you got my heart to win
Before I let you in
And this deceives you baby
I'm not the average lady
I need someone to love 

Baby, take the time to realize I'm
not the kind to sacrifice
