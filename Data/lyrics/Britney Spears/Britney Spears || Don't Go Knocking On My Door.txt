
Don't go knock on my door
Don't go knock on my door 

Time is up
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally
I am over you
Totally unblue
And I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now

[CHORUS:]
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door

I can see
It's no mystery
It's so clear to me
What we had is all history
It's OK
I can sleep at night
It will be alright
I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now

[Repeat CHORUS]

Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Do what you want
As long as you don't come back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
And now I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back

[Repeat CHORUS]
