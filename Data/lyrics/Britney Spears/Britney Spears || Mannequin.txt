
Always talking' around this,
He wants me,
I get things, everything I wanted,
My own way, your time, goldmines,
Loose guys, on my backless, dresses, excess.

[Bridge:]
I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do,
Help myself to anything that I want so thank you,
I like it and I do what I like,
And then you do what I like, and you like it

[Chorus:]
If you wanna just
Scream,
Scream your lungs out,
If you wanna just
Cry,
Cry your eyes out,
(I'm not doing that)
That's what I'm about.

You can cry your eyes out of your head,
Baby, baby,
I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care, I don't care,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin,
(Scream)
Mannequin, yea I did,
It again and again,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin.

You told me you're lonely, 
Can't hear you, 
How dare you?
And then you were frozen, imposin',
There's no way you want me,
Watch me, dress me
Can't impress me,
I'm not changing, I'm just...

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You can cry your eyes out of your head,
Baby, baby,
I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care, I don't care,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin,
(Scream)
Mannequin, yea I did,
It again and again,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),

My face like a mannequin [x5]

Watch me,
(Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me...)

[Chorus]

You can cry your eyes out of your head,
Baby, baby,
I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care, I don't care,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin,
(Scream)
Mannequin, yea I did,
It again and again,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),

My face like a mannequin [x7]
