[Chorus:]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate
A little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1:]
On a whole another level
You got a one way ticket
I got you riding the curve
You wanna kick it, kick it
Start up a riot, riot
We going downtown
I'm all up on ya, on ya
You want it, don't ya, don't ya?

[Chorus:]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate
A little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2:]
I know you feel my fire
Draw you into my flame
Tonight we take it higher
What I got ain't no game
Won't stop 'til you breathe heavy
There'll be no turning back
I'm all up on ya, on ya
You want it, don't ya, don't ya?

You make my body ache
You make my, you make my
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache

You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache

[Chorus:]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate
A little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache

'Til my body ache
