
So wicked
In the way he moves
Don't miss it
Do not be a fool

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

Remembering, I forever will
Surrendering, just to how we felt

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

And when it's all the thunder and rain
The cinema is fading away
I gotta make my way through the night
Holding on with all of my might
And when I'm lost, and I can't the find the way
I feel the pieces breaking away
Hold myself with all of my might
Don't let go
Just hold on tight

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight
