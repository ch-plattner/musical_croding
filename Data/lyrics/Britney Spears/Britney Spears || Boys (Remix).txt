[Britney] 
For whatever reason, 
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life 
You don't understand 
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time 
It's over now 

I spotted you dancin' 
You made all the girls stare 
Those lips and your brown eyes (Oooh) 
And the sexy hair 
I should shake my thang (Ooh) 
Make the world want you (Ha Ha Ha) 
Tell your boys you'll be back 
I wanna see what you can do (Uh) 

What would it take for you to just leave with me? 
Not trying to sound conceited but 
You and me were meant to be (Yeah Yeah) 
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (Uh) 
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world 

Boys! 
Sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you) 
Boys! 
To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me) 
Boys! 
And when a girl is with one (Mmm) 
Boys! 
Then she's in control! 

[Pharrell From N.E.R.D] 
Pull the girl off the dance floor 
Whisper in ear 
Must've said somethin' bout me (What you say) 
Cos now she's lookin' over here 
You lookin' at me (He He He) 
With that sexy attitude 
But the way your girls movin' it (Uh) 
It puts me in the mood 
(Ow!) 

What would it take for you to just leave with me? 
Not trying to sound conceited 
But meeting you was destiny 
I'm from N.E.R.D, Aren't you Britney? (Don't you know?) 
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty thing (Get Nasty!) 

Girls! 
I can't speak for no one (I get nasty) 
Girls! 
But I need her all the time (It's just me and you baby) 
Girls! 
I don't know 'bout your girl 
Girls! 
But I know she's on your mind (Get Nasty) 

[Britney]
Boys! 
Sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty) 

[Britney] 
Boys! 
To love her and to hold (I get nasty) 
Boys! 
And when a girl is with one (I get nasty) 
Boys!

You like that 
Here we go 

Have no Fear 
Baby what you waiting for? 
Uh-huh 
Let me see what you can do 

Boys! 
Sometimes a girl just needs one (Ooh) 
Boys! 
(I like that) 
To love her and to hold (The way you move) 
Boys! 
And when a girl is with one (It's gonna turn me on) 
Boys! 
Then she's in control (Ooh) 

[Pharrell]

But I know she's on your mind (Get Nasty)
