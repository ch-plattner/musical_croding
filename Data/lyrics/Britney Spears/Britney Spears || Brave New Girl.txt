
She’s gonna pack her bags
She’s gonna find her way
She’s gonna get right out of this
She don’t want New York
She don’t want L.A.
She’s gonna find that special kiss
She don’t want no sleep
She don’t want no high
Oh, like peaches ‘n’ cream
She’s gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s comin’ out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

So she met this man 
He was kinda rough
He said, girl, whatcha lookin’ for
She said, I don’t know
I go with the flow
He said, let’s get on the floor
He said, you look real cute with your low ride jeans
And your pink little baby tee
Let’s get a room, girl
Come and ride with me

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s comin' out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed 
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

[Digital:] I must keep on moving
Who knew she could feel so alive

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight
Tonight it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
