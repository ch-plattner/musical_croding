
Everyday, I'm in a daze 
Looking for that someone 
And everyday, I sit and kneel and pray 
Oh, sweet love, can I get some? 
So why do you desert me, baby boy? 
I need your love right now! 
And if you desert me, baby boy 
Don't you leave me in your crowd 

[Talking]
Hey baby, what time you gonna get home? 
Oh, really? 
[Sigh] 
Alright, well, I'll see you later, then 
Oh, wait 
Would you mind getting some... 
Yeah, when you come home 
Yeah, that's it 
I love you too 
Bye 

[Singing again] 
Some day when you see my face 
You will think that you have won 
And some day when it's all away 
Our love just begun 
So why did you desert me, baby boy? 
I thought that you, you were the one 
So if you preferred the other one 
She won't bring you the sun (son)
