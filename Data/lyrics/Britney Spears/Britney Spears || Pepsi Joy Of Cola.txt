
My heart wont skip
a beat
I never look before I leap
ride
just enjoy the ride
there'll be no reason why
cuz everythings alright
take your time
baby take your time
the world is yours and mine
look and u will find (and u will find)
ba pa pa pa ba pa pa pa
the joy of pepsi
the world goes round and round
but some things never change
ba pa pa pa ba pa pa pa
the joy of pepsi
I know u can feel it
feel the joy
look
look and u will find
its taste is on my mind
and I wont be denied
ba pa pa pa ba pa pa pa
the joy of pepsi (yea)
ba pa pa pa ba pa pa pa
the joy of pepsi (yeeeaaahhh.)
