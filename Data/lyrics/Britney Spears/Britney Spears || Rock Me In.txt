Rockin' headspace,
I'm trippin' out
This is my place,
What you're about

If you come over we can fly away
Together, let's go

[Chorus:]
Take me down and you hold me right
Spin me all around,
I feel so dizzy, I fall into you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

Can ya hold me tight and don't let go?
Take me in your arms and bring me closer
Ooh I want you, 
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

If you want to, we can race
I'm super fast now,
You wanna chase?
I can fake it, because you're mine
Double time now, so get in line

If you come over we can fly away
Together, let's go

[Chorus]

Rock me in,
You rock me in

My world is spinnin' round you,
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost when you're around me,
Take me so far away from here

Look how I'm spinnin' round you,
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost and can't be found now
Take me down, take me down

If you come over we can fly away
Together, let's go

[Chorus]

Rock me in,
You rock me in

Rock me in,
You rock me in

Rock me in,
You rock me in
