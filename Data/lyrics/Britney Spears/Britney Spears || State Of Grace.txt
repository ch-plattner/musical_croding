Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
And I can't believe that I feel 
What I feel 
Such a strange kind of 'real' 
Love is a state of grace 
Between you and I 

Golden, broken 
I didn't know 
One touch could open 
My body and soul 
And we've just begun 
Like the moon and sun 
We fade to one 

Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
And I can't believe that I feel 
What I feel 
Such a strange kind of 'real' 
Love is a state of grace 
Between you and I 

And the way 
That we feel 
Is a dream 
That we know is real 
Love is a state of grace 
Love is a state of grace 

Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
Love is a state of grace
