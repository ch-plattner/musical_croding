
Get up, get up, get up!
Get up, get up, get up!
Get up, get up, get up!
Get up, get up, get up!

Paparazzi flashin',
You jump on the stage
Sittin' in the crowd,
And I'm watchin' (I'm watchin'),
Baby

Groupies in the back,
You're under attack
They're screamin' your name
But I don't give a damn,
'Cause I like it (I like it),
I like it (I like it)

[Chorus:]
Turn the spotlight on,
Move a little, shred your guitar
You're my dirty rock boy!
Turn the mic way up,
Sweat a little, ownin' the crowd
You're my dirty rock boy!

Get up, get up, get up!
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?
Get up, get up, get up!
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?
Get up, get up, get up!
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?
Get up, get up, get up!
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?

Finishin' your encore,
And sippin' champagne
(A rock star, rock star)
You make me so hot!

Body burnin' up the fever,
Don't make me wait
Meet me in your dressing room,
I want it, want it, want it
(I want it, I want it)

[Chorus]

The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction,
Play me like a guitar and get into action!
The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction,
Play me like a guitar and swing, swing, swing, swing!

[Chorus]
