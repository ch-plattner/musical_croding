He is a hustler
He's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum (bum bum bum)
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable.
He is a sucker with a gun (gun gun gun)
I know you told me I should stay away.
I know you said he's just a dog astray.
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
and even I know this ain't smart.

But Mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical,
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright,
All reason aside I just can't deny,
Love the guy

He is a villain of the devil's law,
He is a killer just for fun (fun, fun, fun),
The man's a snitch and unpredictable,
He's got no conscience, he got none (none, none, none)

All I know should let go but no

'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
and even I know this ain't smart

But Mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical,
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright,
All reason inside I just can't deny,
Love the guy

And he's got my name tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm,
So I guess it's okay,
He's with me,
And I hear people talk (people talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

'Cause Mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical,
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright,
All reason inside I just can't deny,
Love the guy

Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical,
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright,
All reason inside I just can't deny,
Love the guy
