
Stuck here
So far from home
Talking
But they don't know

Can't make sense of the signs
I thought I would die
Till you looked in my eyes

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

I never had
Any where to go
Nothing
I've been here all alone

No one to show me
No one can hear me
Baby just tell me

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

I don't have to know what you're saying
I don't have to be afraid no more
Don't talk no more
That's not what words are for

Till something changes
Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

Strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love
