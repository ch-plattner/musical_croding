[VERSE 1]
10pm 10 to 4
And i came to hit the floor
Thought u knew b4
But if u don't then now u know
Yo tonight I'm bout to mash
Make them other chicks so mad
I'm bout to I shake my ass
Snatch that boy so fast
Make dem other bitches mad

[B-Section]
It's all about me and u
Doin' how we do
Tear the floor up up
Tell em to make room
If they wanna know
Tell em mind their own
But if they wanna look
We can give em a encore

Rockin new designer fits

[B Section]
