I can't stop dreamin' about you
your eyes make me melt away into the day
one kiss on my neck drives me crazy (crazy)
one touch leads you close enough
for you I crave

Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
when you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya

I just can't help myself (yeah)

I can't live one day without you
No stopping the way I feel its so surreal
Make me go AHH boy I lose it
I just cant control myself its so intense

Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
when you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya

I wanna hold you wherever you are
There ain't no time thats wrong
Ain't no place thats too far
Not a care in the world
Just for you, just for me
Where a boy loves a girl and that girl
that girl is me

Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
when you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
