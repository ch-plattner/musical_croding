Owwww....

This kitten got your tongue tied in knots I see
Spit it out 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
If you want this good ish
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it (take it) take no more
Never felt like (felt like) this before
Come on, get me (get me) on the floor
DJ, what you (what you) waiting for?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Owwww....

Watch me move when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancing in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing
I'm noticing you staring
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it (take it) take no more
Never felt like (felt like) this before
Come on get me (get me) on the floor
DJ, what you (what you) waiting for?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

See the sunlight
We ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it
Let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends

Keep on dancing till the world ends
(world ends, world ends, world ends, world ends, world ends)
Keep on dancing till the world ends
(world ends, world ends, the world ends, the world ends)

See the sunlight
We ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it
Let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
(world ends, world ends, world ends, world ends, world ends)
