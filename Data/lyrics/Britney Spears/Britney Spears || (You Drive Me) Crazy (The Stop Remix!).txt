oh
oh

Baby, I'm so into you 
You got that somethin', what can I do 
Baby, you spin me around oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground 

Every time you look at me 
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see 

You drive me crazy 
I just can't sleep 
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh... Crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night 

Tell me, you're so into me 
That I'm the only, one you will see 
Tell me, I'm not in the blue oh 
That I'm not wastin', my feelings on you 

Everytime I look at you, my heart is jumping
What can I do?

You drive me crazy 
I just can't sleep 
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh... Crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night 

Crazy oh
Sing it!
Oh Crazy

Stop!

You drive me crazy baby
Excited, I'm in too deep
oh...
oh, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night!

You drive me crazy 
I just can't sleep 
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night 
Sing it!

Crazy

You drive me crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night!
