[Intro:]
Oh, my love [laugh]
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, yeah 

[Verse 1:]
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times that we've been through 
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong 
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Verse 2:]
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on 
Oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me 
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you 
So forgive me if I do (ooh)
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Hook:]
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything 
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah)

[Chorus:] 
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
(Oh, oh)
I was born to make you happy 
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
