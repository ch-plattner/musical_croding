[Britney] Time may take us apart, but I will still love you. I promise
[Both] And when the stars, stars are falling, I'll keep calling
[Britney] I promise that you'll be my one my only everything, I'll never be untrue
[Don] And I promise back that for your love I will do anything
[Britney] I will give you the stars
[Don] I will buy you the moon
[Britney] And even through longest of our nights
[Don] And Even through the darkest days our
[Both] Love will find away

[CHORUS:]
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you

[Britney] You are my summer breeze my winter sun, my springtime soul, my autumn touch of gold
[Don] You are my sky my rain a way which my love flows cuz you're all
[Both] The smile of my heart and the breathe of my soul
[Britney] Even if we find ourselves apart
[Don] We will hold out hopes and dreams
[Both] Forever in our hearts

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Don] Tell me how you feel
[Britney] I finally know how to feel. Tell me if it's real
[Don] And my heart is tells me it's real
[Britney] So real, so real

[Both] Time will take us apart that's true
But I will always be there for you
Your in my heart and you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars my too
But I will still, I will still love you

[Repeat CHORUS]
