
Are we ready
Are we ready ready
Are we ready
Are we ready ready

Ah ah ah ah..
Ah ah ah ah..

My body feels like an inferno
Like I'm in a race and I'm jumping the hurdle
Come closer we'll pursue it
Baby Just let go we can do it

Baby I'm just hot for taking
Don't you wanna see my body naked
And I bet you like the way I shake it
And I hope that you can take it

[Chorus:]
You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best
Baby, you got me obsessed
And I can't catch my breath
Baby, I must confess you got me
Ah, ah, ah
When you come around
Got me so damn high
Can't come down
Everytime you touch me there
You make me feel so hot

I love it
everything you do is so seductive
You got everything that I want and then some
And I can't even front so listen
I know what your missing
Better hurry up
Cause time is ticking
Tic Tock Tic Tock
Come and Get me while I'm hot

[Chorus]

[x2]
Pull up to my bumper
Need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low
Let me drive you crazy
All night cause we got so far to go

[Chorus]
