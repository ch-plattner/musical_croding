[Danja Intro (Radio News Break):]
"Ladies and Gentlemen, we interrupt our program of Dance Music, to bring you a special
Bulletin from the intercontinental radio news. Our very own Pop Princess -now Queen of Pop, has
A special announcement she will like to make..."

[Talking:]
You're on...
I think I'm ready for my close up...
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
You don't like me
I don't like you, It don't matter (Who?)
Only difference
You still listen, I don't have to (Who?)
In one ear and
Out the other, I don't need yah (Who?)
Your words don't stick
I ain't perfect, but you ain't either (Who?)

If your feeling froggy leap (Oh)
I ain't even losin' sleep (Oh)
There's more to me than what you see (Oh)
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry...

[Chorus:]
Mr. Photographer
I think I'm ready for my close-up (Tonight)
Make sure you catch me from my good side (Pick one!)
These other (HA) just wanna be me
Is that money in your pocket?
Or you happy to see me?

Kill the Lights!
(Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the Lights!
(Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the Lights!
(I've seen you, watching me, watching you)
Kill the Lights!
You can't handle the truth
What happened to you?

I KILL
(The Lights) Pure
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL
(The Lights) Lights
(The Lights) Camera
(The Lights) Action

I KILL
(The Lights) Pure
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL
(The Lights) Lights
(The Lights) Camera
(The Lights) Action

[Verse 2]
All the flashin', tryin' to cash-in
Hurts my eyes
All the poses, out of focus
I despise

Eff me over, your exposure
Not the best
You want me bad, I want you out
Release this stress...

[Chorus:]
Mr. Photographer (Yeaaaaaah...)
I think I'm ready for my close-up (Tonight) (Yeaaaaaah...)
Make sure you catch me from my good side (Pick one!) (Yeaaaaaah...)
These other (HA) just wanna be me
Is that money in your pocket? (Yeah)
Or you happy to see me?

Kill the Lights!
(Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the Lights!
(Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the Lights!
(I've seen you, watching me, watching you)
Kill the Lights!
You can't handle the truth
What happened to you?

I KILL (Hey!)
(The Lights) Pure (Hey!)
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL (Hey!)
(The Lights) Lights (Hey!)
(The Lights) Camera
(The Lights) Action

I KILL (C'mon)
(The Lights) Pure (Hey!)
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL (Hey!)
(The Lights) Lights (Hey!)
(The Lights) Camera
(The Lights) Action

[Bridge:]
You're the star now, welcome to the big league
They all want a pic, they all wanna see, see, see
What you're made of... what you're gonna do
Is life gonna get the best of you?

[Chorus:]
Kill the Lights!
(Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the Lights!
(Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the Lights!
(I've seen you, watching me, watching you)
Kill the Lights!
You can't handle the truth
What happened to you?

I KILL (Hey!)
(The Lights) Pure (Hey!)
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL (Hey!)
(The Lights) Lights (Hey!)
(The Lights) Camera
(The Lights) Action

I KILL (C'mon)
(The Lights) Pure (Hey!)
(The Lights) Satis
(The Lights) Faction
I KILL (Hey!)

[Ad-libs:]
Yeaaaaaaah...
Yeaaaaaaah...
Yeaaaaaaah...
Yeaaah.
