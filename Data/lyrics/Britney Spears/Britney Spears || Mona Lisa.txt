[intro (spoken)]
This is the story about... Mona Lisa

About Mona Lisa

Mona Lisa

[verse 1]
Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell (huh)
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over, to release her from her spell

[chorus]
She's the original, she's unforgettable
She wants you to know (yeah) she's been gone
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (yeah) cuz she's been gone, cuz she's been gone, cuz she's been gone

[verse 2]
She was taken under, drowning in her seat (huh)
Running like an angel, she was crying and she could not see (oh no!)
Now see everyone's watching, as she starts to fall
They want her to break down
There will be a legend of her fall...

[repeat chorus]

[verse 3]
Now Ladies does that make you cry? (huh)
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really does
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence? Right Here.

[chorus 2x]
