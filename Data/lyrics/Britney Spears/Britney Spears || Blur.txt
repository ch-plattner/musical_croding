Turn the lights out 
This shit is way too fucking bright 
Wanna poke my eyes out 
If you wanna mess with my eyesight 
Just let me get my head right 
Where the hell am I? 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Hey yeah yeah 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Hey yeah yeah 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
What's your name, man? 

Can you calmly hand me all my things? 
I think I need an aspirin 
Better yet, I need to get up outta here 
I gotta get my head right 
Where the hell am I? 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur 

What happened last night? 
'Cause I don't-- 'cause I don't remember 
What happened? 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night (Blur) 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur
