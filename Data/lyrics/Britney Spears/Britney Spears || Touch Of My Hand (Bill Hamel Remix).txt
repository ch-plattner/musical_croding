
I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream 
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene 
Into the unknown, I will be bold 
I'm going to places I can be out of control 

And I don't want to explain tonight 
All the things I've tried to hide 
I shut myself out from the world so I 
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 

I love myself 
It's not a sin 
I can't control what's happenin' 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

From the small of my back and the arch of my feet 
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me 
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait 
I'm into myself in the most precious way 

And I don't want to explain tonight 
All the things I've tried to hide 
I shut myself out from the world so I 
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

There's a world undifined 
And my body is mine 
I won't be left behind 
I'm already here 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand
