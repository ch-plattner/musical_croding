
I still see your coast hangin' on the door,
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

Don't ask, me why
I just can't say goodbye
No not, tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm gonna hold on
Yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on
So I gotta hold on
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby like quicksand
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand

You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridoor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

Wish I, could try
But I just can't say goodbye
No not, tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]

'Cause the ground is breaking,
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy,
But it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands up,
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing,
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking

'Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (Hold)

[Chorus]

Only got one life to live,
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me,
We need to hold on and hold on and...

Only got one life to live,
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me,
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on
And hold on, and hold on

And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
