
Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know 
That something wasn't right here 
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go 
And now you're out of sight yeah 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby, cuz I need to know now, oh, because 

[Chorus:]
My loneliness is killing me (And I) 
I must confess I still believe (Still believe) 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time 

Oh baby baby, the reason I breathe is you 
Boy you've got me blinded 
Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
That's not the way I planned it 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby cuz I need to know now, oh, because 

[Chorus]

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know 
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go 
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now 
Don't you know I still believe 
That you will be here and give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 

[Chorus]
