Listen, listen 

Come on 

You read my eyes 
My vibes 
My body's pace 
Lookin' my way and I'm lookin' your way 

So heres the thing that I need 
I'll make it clear 
Now heres your chance 
But first understand me 

I ain't down for relationships 
I'm not like all them other chicks 
I just want it, when I want it 

Nothin' serious goin' 
Ain't no reason to rush in 
Nothing starts till I say go 
I don't really wanna tease you 
I don't wanna mislead you 
You'll get some, When I say so 

Uh, uh - when I say so 

You're feeling me 
My jeans 
My baby tee 
You want it now 
But just chill 
Slow it down 

Ah 

Think you got game 
And you know 
How to play with me 
But who told you 
That this will be easy 

I might be down for relationships 
Gotta do me right to make me wanna flip 
I just want it, when i want it 

Nothin' serious goin' 
Ain't no reason to rush in 
Nothing starts till I say go 
I don't really wanna tease you 
I don't wanna mislead you 
You'll get some, When I say so (When I say so) 

[Rapping]

You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 
You'll get some when I say so 

Nothin' serious goin' 
Ain't no reason to rush in 
Nothing starts till I say go 
I don't really wanna tease you 
I don't wanna mislead you (ooo) 
You'll get some, When I say so 

Nothin' serious goin' 
Ain't no reason to rush in 
Nothing starts till I say go (slow, slow) 
I don't really wanna tease you 
I don't wanna mislead you 
You'll get some, (You'll get some) When I say so 

Nothin' serious goin' 
Ain't no reason to rush in 
Nothing starts (Nothin' starts) till I say go 
I don't really wanna tease you (baby) 
I don't wanna mislead you 
You'll get some, When I say so 

You'll get some when I say so
