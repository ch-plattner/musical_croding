
Keep telling myself
Get out of my mind
The way it feels
It feels so right

And every night
I feel the heat
Close my eyes
And it comes to me

I confess if I've done it wrong
But in your eyes I see I'm guilty
I'm guilty

The stress that keeps me strong
I feel as though
My heart is empty
Cause you're not with me

In my secret place
Where I drift away

Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?

Don't watch the truth unfold
Please don't try to see right through me
When you touch me

You will never know
Imagination starts to haunt me
It controls me

In my secret place
Where I drift away

Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?

Am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Just tell me
Am I a sinner?

Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?

Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?

Am I a sinner
Am I a sinner
Am I a sinner
Just tell me
Am I a sinner
