
Night, day
Shadows
Got me wishing that I'm all alone
Light a candle
Disconnect my telephone.

Runaway
To the 'morrow
Forget where we are.
Throw away
All we follow
'Cause I can't see anymore.
Yeah yeah

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

Voices, echo
Like a hook on the radio
Visions, [?]
I still, want to...

Runaway
To the 'morrow
Forget where we are.
Throw away
All we follow
'Cause I can't see anymore.
Yeah yeah

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

You don't understand
We don't have to stand alone
Sittin' on our hands
Waitin' for a chance
'cause I got you babe,
I got you babe, I got you babe
I wanna know.
I don't need a drug, I'm alive
Tryin' to make you understand
No matter what, not afraid to be your friend,
I got you babe, I got you babe
I wanna know.

You don't understand
We don't have to stand alone
Sittin' on our hands
Waitin' for a chance
'cause I got you babe,
I got you babe, I got you babe
I wanna know.
I don't need a drug, I'm alive
Tryin' to make you understand
No matter what, not afraid to be your friend,
I got you babe, I got you babe
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic.
