[Britney:] Yeah, yeah oh 

Oh I was broken hearted 
Feeling sad and all alone 
I thought I was going crazy, baby 

I thought the pain would last forever 
I thought he'd never ever hurt me, and hurt me 
Over and over again 

Ohh 
When you tried into my world 
You showed the loving ways of how 
A guy should treat a girl 
The love you give that makes me breathe again 

I've found someone who feels me 
An understanding friend till the end 

I know the future no one can see 
But I feel deep in my heart 
You will stay with me eternally 

So just love me 
Even every day 
And hold me in your arms now 
Please love the hurt away 

[FF:] I'll make it go away, yes I will 
[B:] Oh hurt away (ohhh) 

[FF:] I see heaven in your eyes 
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie 
He must have been out of his mind 

I would never hurt you baby 
Don't let one fool turn you cold (oh no) 
You've got a heart of gold 

[B:] Heart Of gold 
[FF:] I love everything about you 
[B:] All I know is 

[B & FF:] Every word I take it straight to you 
A special part I give for everything I do 

Nobody else comes close to the love you give 
Body and soul 
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live 

[FF:] And I know 
It's not easy letting go (No it's not easy) 
But I won't let you fall 
Together you and me 
We've got it all 

[B:] I just love you 
More and more each day 
I rest my head on your shoulder 
Please love the hurt away 

Love the hurt away 

I know 
I know the future no one can see 
But I feel deep in my heart 
You will stay with me eternally 

[FF:] I just love you 
More and more each day 

[B & FF:] (No, oh) Please love the hurt away (ohh yeah) 
Oh my love 
Love the hurt away (oh oh yeah) 

[B:] Please love the hurt away
