[Intro]
Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are You ready?
I dont think so

[Part 1]
Somebody give me my truck 
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like...

Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like...

Whatchu gonna do when the croud goes Ayo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why dont you just move along?

[Chorus]
I see you lookin at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why dont you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat,  
Why dont you do somethin'?

[Part 2]
Now you all in my grill
Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Baby bump bump 
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
I can roll if you can
Dont be a punk punk

Whatchu gonna do when the croud goes Ayo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why dont you just move along?

[Chorus x2]

Na nananananana
Uh!
Na nananananananana

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' over here
Cant you tell I'm havin' fun
If you care like I know
You would stop
starrin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'

[chorus x2]

Fuck!
Do Somethin'
Ow!
Why dont you do somethin'?
