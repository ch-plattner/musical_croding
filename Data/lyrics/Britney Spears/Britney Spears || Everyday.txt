Footsteps in the rain, memories wash away
Beyond the headlight glare, it's kind of dark out there
And everywhere I've been, it's hard to find a friend
I've got no alibis for the state I'm in

Everybody needs, needs a place to go
God know's I have seen it's a twisting, winding road

Every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day

Said every day, I said every day, every day

It's hard to recognize, across the great divide
Just what you left behind and what you keep inside
A ripple in the calm, you keep my safe from harm
Somehow you still believe, you believe in me
Where it starts and ends, only time must know
Wherever you will be is where I wanna go

Every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day

'Cause you set me free
'Cause you set me free

And every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day
