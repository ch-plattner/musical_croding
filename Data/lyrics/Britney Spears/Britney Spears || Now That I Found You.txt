
On a shameless night
In a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case til I found you (til I found you)
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
The world's no love just pain and pity til I found you (til I found you)

And I don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And I don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have found the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found, now that I found you
I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have found the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found, now that I found you

[Instrumental]

Yeah

[Instrumental]

All my life
I've waited for this day
Have waited for you
Now I adore you
All my life
I've waited for this day
Have waited for you
Now I adore you

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have found the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found, now that I found you
Yeah
