It's written everywhere 
I've even read it in my script 
But when I thought it wasn't fair 
I felt it on my lips, let go 
I don't wanna be the one 
I think you already know, oh 

The feeling of going down way too deep 
Holding on 
So you won't lose your feet 
Sometimes you just gotta trust 
You gotta take that leap 
And let go 
Gotta let go 

I've got a feeling 
By your look you're through 
Oh no 
What you're revealing 
I sit and pray 
And I will pull through, oh no yeah 

When you let go 
Of all you've known 
The butterflies fly 
And you will see the rainbows 
And all the love 
Everything will be shown 
So let go 
Let go 

The touch of grass 
The air 
The sun it will rise 
You will see so clear 
It will bring tears to your eyes 
Maybe everything will be alright 
So let go 
You gotta let go 

I've got a feeling 
Right now 
You feel it too 
Oh, oh 
This little song 
Might be the one 
That will tell us what to do 
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh 

These tears are overflowing 
And never knowing why 
All these years we've been 
We've been hurting 
We have to look inside 
And try 
To let go 

You gotta let go 
To love, you gotta let go 
If you really wanna love 
You gotta let go
