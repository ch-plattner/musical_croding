[Verse 1:]
Lying alone 
Touching my skin 
I'm falling under 
A girl like me 
And I can't hold it in 
It makes me wonder 

Is this for real? 
It's not what it seems 
You're like an angel 
I'm running now 
My feet off the ground 

[Pre-chorus:]
Take me 
Touch me 
Won't you hold me close? 

[Chorus:]
And then we kiss 
Your love comes alive on my lips 
I feel a rush 
Coming over me, over me 
And when we touch 
This moment when everything's still 
I close my eyes 
And then we kiss 

The feel of your hand 
As it touches my hair 
It makes me tremble 
Don't wanna let go 
Of the feelings we share 
So baby, go slow 

Our hearts beating fast 
And my body cries 
I want it to last 
It's burning inside 
We're getting deeper 

[Pre-chorus x1]
[Chorus x1]

You're drifting 
The sun comes up 
You're fading 
You seem so far 
I don't know 
If I'm awake 
Open my eyes 
And then ww 
We kiss... 

[Pre-chorus x1]
[Chorus x1]

And then we kiss 
And then we kiss 
And when we touch 
This moment when everything's still 
I close my eyes 
And then we kiss
