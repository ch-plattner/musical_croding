Let me see your passport
Please take off your glasses
Gotta get through customs, taxi, baggage
You know you still love me
Sicily to the U.K
Keep them hands up everywhere follow me I’m about to take you abroad

Show up in your town
Second that I’m touchin down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I’m with my friends
Sexy men
Whisper foreign in my ear
She’s so hot
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

Looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I’m face to face
I feel like runnin away
(I need a)
think I just I need a getaway
time for a break a holiday
time that I make my great escape
I need it now
I need it today
I need it today

Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
I’m goin abroad.. I’m goin abroad..

I don’t speak the language
But they know my name here
Frequent flier mileage
Platinum next year
No fear
Bonjour in France
Keep my head wrapped up in Hermes
Tropical destination
Get my rest and my relaxation abroad

Show up in your town
Second that I’m Touchin down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I’m with my friends
Sexy men
Whisper foreign in my ear
She’s so hot
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

Today
I need a change of pace
To see some different faces
I need to get away
I need a break from u
I need a break for me
Gimme a break from here
Somewhere that I can clear my head
I’m goin abroad
I’m goin abroad
