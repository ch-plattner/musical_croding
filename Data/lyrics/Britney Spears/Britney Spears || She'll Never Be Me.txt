
You know I'm one of a kind;
Boy what's this I see,
Your girl - she looks just like me,
Blond hair and dressed to a T,
You tell me how can this be,
Does she know I was the one,
Who used to turn you on,
Yeah,
But you don't want to talk about it
Well you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She dont do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

[CHORUS:]
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

Why can't you see it girl?
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
You tell me "How can this be?"
Does she know I was the one
Who use to turn you on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it
And the way you must feel
You got to be confused
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

[CHORUS]

Don't you think that she would see through you
But you don't want to think about it
Try so hard to do the thing I do
But you don't want to think about it

[CHORUS x2]

She'll never be me
