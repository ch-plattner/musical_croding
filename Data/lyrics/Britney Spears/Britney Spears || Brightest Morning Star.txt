
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life

You know I wake up and everyday,
I feel safe knowing that you got my back now and forever
Living my life 'cause I've got nothing to do
When a tear falls,
You put your hands out, you catch my tears,
And I'm feeling so close to your love now
If I was lost, I've found my way

I lift my hands and pray 'cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith 'cause you will lead the way

You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star

In you arms I feel alive, I am not afraid
I will keep you, listen closely,
I look for signs everyday

I lift my hands and pray 'cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith 'cause you will lead the way

You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life
