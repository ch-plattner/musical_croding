Let's, let's play pretend
Like you're my friend
And everything is O.K.

Then we shall begin
To put an end
To all the games that we play

My body's a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal

So if you're ready
Just call me on the phone
I'll be here waiting
No need to be alone

Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, my God, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you

So, say how have you been
How's your girlfriend
It's funny you're here with me
When you're still with her
And I do prefer
That we don't feel guilty

My body is a temple 
I'll choose who worships it
let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal

So if you are ready
Then this is what I'll do
I'll take my time to ***
You used to use me too

Oh, you do
Ooh,here we go

Ouch, don't stop,you‘re burning me up
Please don't stop,you‘re making me blush
Ouch, don't stop,you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you
Of you, of you, of you

Do you remember?
How we used to do
I was your girlfriend
We were so true
Let's play pretend
