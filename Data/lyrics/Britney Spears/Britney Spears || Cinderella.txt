
I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh yes you know its true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell
And I'd be there for you

Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Oh, But Cinderellas got to go

From time to time I'd try to tell just what was on my mind.
You'd tell me not today.
Come back, do that.
Wheres, Cinderella at...
Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
here we are with nothing but honesty
i've had..enough...i'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this 'n i'm sorry
i've already made my wish. Ah, but cinderella's
got to go

i'm sorry just tryin' to live my life
don't worry, you're gonna be alright
but cinderellas got to go.

[spoken]

I used to say I want you, you cast me in your spell.
I did everything you wanted me to, but now i shall..
break free from all your lies. I won't be blind you see,
my love it can't be sacrificed, i won't return to thee.

[sung]
I'm so sorry, i've already made up my mind

[spoken]
I won't return to thee

[sung]
I'm sorry to say, i'm runnin' away now...
don't worry, you will be alright

i'm runnin' away, i've made up my mind now..

I'm sorry for runnin' away like this, and I'm
sorry I've already made my wish
Oh, but cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live my life, don't worry, 
your going to be alright!
