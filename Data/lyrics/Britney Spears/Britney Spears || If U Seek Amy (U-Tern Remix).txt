Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime?
For the drink that Imma buy her
Do you know just what she likes?

Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home?

Ha, ha, he, he, ha, ha, ho

Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club
I've seen her once or twice before; she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way

Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home?

Ha, ha, he, he, ha, ha, ho

Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Oh, say what you want about me
Oh, but can't you see what I see?
Love me, hate me
Oh, say what you want about me

So tell me if you see her
(She was wearing or what she was like)
'Cause I've been waiting here forever
(She was going out of line)

Oh, baby, baby, if you seek Amy tonight (Oh)
Oh, baby, baby, we'll do whatever you like
Oh, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me (Yeah)
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me
Oh, say what you want about me
Oh, but can't you see what I see?
Love me, hate me
Oh, say what you want about me

All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
