You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

[Chorus:]
Think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities, won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
It ain't my philosophy,
Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust in my instincts
Trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons
That keep you up at night (at night)
Tell me "Go slow"
This is my flow
'Cause you don't know
Know what I know

Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

[Chorus]

Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go

[Chorus x2]
