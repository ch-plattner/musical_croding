[Britney Spears:]
Till the world ends remix

[Nicki Minaj:]
Chimpanzee's is hatin', but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talking poultry when I say this chicken's fried

Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with' me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, burned Breadale'
What's that? I know boyfriend Fatale

Sniff, sniff, cries, I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
Oh oh, you got some Epsom Salt
I done balled all day you ain't touched the court

What? What you tired? You need a break? You was hot when? Ricki Lake!

[Britney Spears:]
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level baby
If you understood bitch, this is the remix
Baby let me blow your mind tonight

[Nicki Minaj:]
It's Britney bitch, I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha!

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
I Can't Take It Take It Take No More
Never Felt Like Felt Like This Before
C'mon Get Me Get Me On The Floor
DJ What You What You Waitin' For...

Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...
Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...

[Britney Spears:]
Watch Me Move When I Lose When I Lose It Hard
Get You Off With The Touch Dancing In The Dark
You Notice What I'm Wearin'
I'm Noticin' You Starin'
You Know That I Can Take It To The Next Level Baby
Hotter Than The A-list
Next One On My Hit List
Baby Let Me Blow Your Mind Tonight!

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
I Can't Take It Take It Take No More
Never Felt Like Felt Like This Before
C'mon Get Me Get Me On The Floor
DJ What You What You Waitin' For...

Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...
Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...
Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...
Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...

[Bridge:]
See The Sunlight
We Ain't Stoppin'
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends
If You Feel It Let It Happen
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends

Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh...

See The Sunlight
We Ain't Stoppin'
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends
If You Feel It Let It Happen
Keep On Dancing Till The World Ends
