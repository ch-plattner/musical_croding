
Yeah
Sometimes I just love to have that out
Just something a girl’s gotta do, oh

Never thought I’d see you like this
You lookin’ good when you’re half dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin, no
Am I too hot for you though
Did you check out my video
There’s some things you don’t know
Like this

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
‘Cause if we break up
Then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

I don’t really wanna be a tease
But would you undo my zipper please
Uh uh, please don’t talk
Listen
I’ll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don’t get too hot
Butterfly

I dare you to stand in my way.
Just give in when you are ready to play
Like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
‘Cause if we break up
Then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

Forget the tension
When we fight
You make it up
Turn down the light
It’s just a lover’s game we play, yeah
After the screaming’s at an end
Why don’t we do it all again
That’s when the fun really begins
Oh, whoa

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
‘Cause if we break up
Then we can make up
Shake my body all night

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Here comes the showdown
Here comes the showdown, oh
What goes around comes around
The crowds are waiting, oh

Yeah
Here comes the showdown, oh
