
Laying here in your arms
And you hold me tight, tight 
Tryin' not to watch the clock
Tick, Tickin' as the time goes by (by)
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishin' I could make you stay
Stay with me for a while

Though
You're near
Still
I wanna make it clear
Love
I will always be around

You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

I Feel It 
Already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

Kinda hard for me to let you know
Still don't let my feelings show
How much I will miss in you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak
Without you baby I'm not me (I'm not me)

Though
You're near
Still
I wanna make it clear
Love
I will always be around

You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

I Feel It 
Already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

I Feel It 
Already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye (goodbye)

You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

I Feel It 
Already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
