
Just yesterday
You were looking up to me
And, You'd ask me
What I thought

But now I'm sitting here
All alone with my tears
Lookin' at my life
That I've bought

Where did I go? (yeah)
My eyes, they will show

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

But now I'm sitting here
You were looking up to me
And, You'd ask me
What I thought

But now I'm sitting here
All alone with my tears
Lookin' at my life
That I've bought

Where did I go? (yeah)
My eyes they will show

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

Where did I go? (yeah)
My eyes they will show

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside
