[CHORUS:]
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
but summer love will keep us warm long after
our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
autumn goodbye 

Thinkin' of you and the love of our lives
in the sweet summertime
so sad but true (so true, so true)
we must leave it behind
in our hearts, in our minds

From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget
I remember

[Repeat CHORUS (2 times)]

Memories can fade
but my heart has a place for the smile on your face
and maybe someday
we can be more than friends
love will find us again

Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
on the time that we borrowed

[Repeat CHORUS (2 times)]

From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget
I remember baby

[Repeat CHORUS (2 times)]

We'll leave behind the summertime
our hearts, our minds
they will remind
we won't forget
the day we met
the day we cried
Autumn Goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
but summer love will keep us warm long after
our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
autumn goodbye
