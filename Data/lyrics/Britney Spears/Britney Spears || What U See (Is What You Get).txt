
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am 

[Chorus:]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

I know you watch me when I'm dancin'
When I party with me friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby
I can't have no chains around me, baby can't you see
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

[Repeat Chorus]

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
Believe me, you'll be looking for trouble if you hurt me
I can promise you, you'll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah yeah yeah yeah
