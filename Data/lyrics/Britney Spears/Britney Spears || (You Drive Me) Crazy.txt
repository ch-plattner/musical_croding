
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin'. What can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus:]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue,
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Lovin' you means so much more.
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus]

Crazy,
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy,
But it feels alright
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
(you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Oh... crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
