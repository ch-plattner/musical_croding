You're always too busy
Why don't you go with me
Don't act like you don't hear me
neglected
you're guilty
He noticed no one was with me
I started getting so friendly
He told me I was so pretty
I flirted
I'm guilty

I have no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side, but you were nowhere to Ibe found
But you pushed your luck
Now it's all messed up
But you went too far when you broke my heart and I found my guy
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs
Then I guess that makes me guilty

Guilty [x2]

Stop wondering a thing but
I want you so bad it's danger
It's true I'm nobody's angel
Convict me
I'm guilty
You ain't no...
So good for...
It's not like I did it on purpose
The verdict is nothing
He needs me

Tonight you'll cry
Ain't nothing more
That's why deicided to sing this song 'bout
I'm fakin'
Girls hearts breakin
I was up beatin' and screaming 'n faking
You sit there say I'm filthy when you're the one who made me guilty
