Oh baby baby
Have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom
Is she smokin' up outside
Oh

Oh baby baby
Does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'm gonna buy her
Do you know just what she likes
Oh

[Refrain:]
Oh Oh
Tell me have you seen her
Because I'm so
Oh
I can't get her off of my brain
I just want to go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home
Ha ha he ha ha ho

[Chorus]
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are
begging to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls
are begging to If You Seek Amy

Lalalalalala

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club
Oh

I've seen her once or twice before she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way
Oh

[Refrain]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Oh
Say what you want about me
Oh
But can't you see what I see
Oh
Say what you want about me

So tell me if you see her
Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like
Cause I have been waiting here forever
Let me know when she going out
Oh baby baby
If You Seek Amy tonight
Oh
Oh baby baby
We'll do whatever you like
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby

Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

All of the boys and all of the girls are
begging to If You Seek Amy
