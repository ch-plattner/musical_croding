
Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change.

[Chorus-1:]
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found it seems like we can't go wrong.

[Chorus-2:]
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
'Cause love you so
Ohhoohh I want you for the rest of my life.

Some people search what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this
And here we are
With everything we wished for
I never felt such bliss.

[Repeat Chorus 1+2]

There comes a chance in everyones life
And I beleive it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I want spend forever
(And ever with you).

[Repeat Chorus 2 (2 times)]

Deep in my heart
Deep in my heart
I want you for the rest of my life
I want you for the rest of my life.
