Nothin' about you is typical
Nothin' about you's predictable
You got me all twisted and confused
(It's so you)
Up 'til now, I thought I knew love
Nothin' to lose and it's damaged 'cause
Pattern to fall as quick as I do
(But now)

Bridges are burnin'
Baby, I'm learnin'
A new way of thinking now
Love, I can see
Nothing will be
Just like it was
Is that because

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah

Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, tryin' to defend myself
And the private eye to see what's goin' on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you say you will be
Shocking, 'cause I never knew love like this
Could exist

Tables are turnin'
My heart is soarin'
You'll never let me down
Answer my call
Here after all
Never met anyone
Like you

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah

Can't believe that I
Almost didn't try
When you called my name
Now everything is changed

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
