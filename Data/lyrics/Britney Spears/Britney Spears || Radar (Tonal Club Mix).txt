Confidence is a must,
Edginess is a rush
A man with a Midas touch
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking you so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)

When you walk 
And when you talk
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want 
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
radar
on my radar
[x2]

Interesting sense of style, ten million dollar smile
Think I can handle that? Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul, I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again, falling right into my plan

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking it, so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)

When you walk 
And when you talk 
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want 
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
radar
on my radar
[x2]

I'm checking it, so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar 
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar 

When you walk 
And when you talk 
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want 
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
radar
on my radar
[x4]
