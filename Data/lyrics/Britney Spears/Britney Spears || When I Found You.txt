
I believe
We all have one true love
Somewhere in this world
I do (I do, I do)

When it seemed
All my dreams
Were falling through
That's when I found you

I believe for every heart
That whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere
Shining through
It was sink
Or swim
When the tide came in

I found myself
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you

Ooh yeah

I believe (I believe)
For every door (Every door)
That's closing
For every heartbreakÂ 
There's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you

A life unfolds
No one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone
All Alone
More than you could ever know
You show deep love
Sweet love

When I found you (I found love)
Oooh (the closest thing to heaven)
Oh yeah
I found you baby, I found you
I found you
Yeah
I found myself

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you, you
