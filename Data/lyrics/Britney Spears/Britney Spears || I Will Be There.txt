
Oh yeah

You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And then let me begin

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[CHORUS:]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I, will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I, will be there

Won't you let me make it up to you
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothin that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[Repeat CHORUS]

I will be there
Just take a stand
I'll be here for you
Now and forever
Give one more chance
To show you how much I care
I'll be there

When you need someone
I just turn around
And I will be there
When you're in sorrow
Just let me know and I will be there

[Repeat CHORUS]
