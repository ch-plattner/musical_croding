Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby...

Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play 'brand new' to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You got me goin'
(You!) You're oh so charmin'
(You!) But I can't do it
(You!) You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You say I'm crazy
(You!) I got your crazy
(You!) You're nothing but a
(You!) Womanizer
