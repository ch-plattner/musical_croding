
I'm a dynamite factory
Just light a match baby you will see
We detonate like fireworks
Watch out cause I'm feeling nasty

See me looking at you and you turned away
Wanna know, do I make you uncomfortable
Think you know all the rules of the games that you play
When it all comes around you got nothing to say

Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping, your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous (it's getting dangerous)

Watching me, you're crawling at my feet
I've seen it all and now it's on repeat
I'm razor sharp and I'm cutting deep
And you love it when I'm getting nasty

Now you're begging for me, you don't want me to go
When the hell is your feeling get down so low
Cause I gave you my heart then you threw it away
When I came back to you you had nothing to say

Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping, your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous (it's getting dangerous)

Watch out
I'm coming right at you
There's no sign of warning
Nothing you can do

Rising
The tempature's on now
You better stay at home
Cause it's getting dangerous

Can't stop it
Before you started up you started to break
There's a feeling when your head starts stripping, your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way forget you
No I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous (it's getting dangerous)
