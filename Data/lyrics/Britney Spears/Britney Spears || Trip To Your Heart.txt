
For tonight
It's just the two of us
Turn the light now
Just the two of us
Like how you, oh, whisper in my ear
Your breath like a ghost that disappeared

Hold me close, hold me close
Hold me tight now
Need you more, want you más
Feels so right now

Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Baby, can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard from my memory
Your body feels like a fantasy
This moment's all that I can see

Hold me close, strip me down
Hold me tight now
Need you more, want you más
Feels so right now

Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Trip to your eyes
Trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss
Trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue
Trip to your voice
Trip to your talk
Trip to your heart

Trip to your head
Trip to your chest
Trip to your breath
Trip to your skin
Trip to your sin
Trip to your touch
Trip to your tears
Trip to your heart

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
