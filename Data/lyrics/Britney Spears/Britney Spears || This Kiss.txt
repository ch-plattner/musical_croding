There was a time when you were mine
There was a time when you helped me to hide, baby
And now you're around me
Boy, I wish you could find me, oh oh

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just wants you, oh baby
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just loves you, my friend

Now you're gone, you left me
What's up girl, do so oppressed, you see
And right when I saw the door
You walked in and I fell to the floor, yeah

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just wants you, oh baby
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just loves you, my friend

Everyday I wake up and you're not there, no no
It takes too much to me, I just can't spare
So why, tell me why, why did you go away, away?
This girl's gonna be all alone
So come back to me, come back to me
Oh, why did you go? I feel so alone

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just wants you, oh baby
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just loves you, my friend

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just wants you, oh baby
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just loves you, my friend
