
Will you turn me up?
Yeah!

This is the making
Of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration
So give undivided attention

Okay, light speed
Turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around
One shot, you're killin' me

[Chorus:]
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting
Don't keep me waiting
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

The time is tickin'
The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So come to your destination

Okay, light speed
Turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around
One shot, you're killin' me

[Chorus:]
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting
Don't keep me waiting
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

[Bridge:]
What the hell?
I'm standin- wha- what the hell?
Stan- standing outside
I'm standing outside
Wha- wha- what- wha- wha-
What the hell!
I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer
Come out and melt my ice
I'm running out of time
You're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride
Before I change my mind
Don't apologize

[Chorus - Outro:]
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
