[Intro]
You, you, you...

[Britney]
I loved so much that I cried
I danced so much til I was tired
I drank some red wine and now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry 'bout a thing

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry 'bout a thing

When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
I'm chill

[Jamie]
I sang so loud that I smiled
I made it worth my while
I drank some white wine
Now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
I'm chill

[Bridge]
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Chillin' with you
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

And you know, I, I, I
I'm feeling alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

[Both]
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
