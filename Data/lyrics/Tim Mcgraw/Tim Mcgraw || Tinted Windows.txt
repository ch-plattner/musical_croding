
I had tinted windows on my first car,
We used to park out by the reservoir.
We had the water, radio and the stars,
Never had to worry our friends would come knocking on those

Tinted windows covered in steam,
Floorboard piled up with t-shirts and jeans.
You didn't know what you were doing to me,
But I was so gone baby, I was so gone for you.

Oh, it doesn't seem like it could really be,
So long ago when we were seventeen,
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and

Tinted windows and six-pack of light,
I know I didn't pop the question right,
But that diamond looked good in the dashboard light
And you said, "Yes, you know the answer is Yes"

Oh, it doesn't seem like it could really be,
So long ago when we were seventeen,
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and
Tinted windows...

We sold that car back in '97
Should have got 15, but we only got 11
We grew up and we grew apart
The years rolled by and now your eyes are

Tinted windows and I wanna believe
Somewhere inside you're still in love with me
I keep looking, hoping to see it through those
Tinted windows, all those tinted windows

Tinted windows, those tinted windows
Tinted windows
Tinted windows
