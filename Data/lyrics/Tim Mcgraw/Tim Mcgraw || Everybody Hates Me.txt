
Well Joe got a promotion
He's up there on top
Everybody was cheerin' him on
He deserves everything he's got

Guess who's the new talk of the town
The new S.O.B.
The one everybody loves cuttin' down
Man it's a sight to see
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place,
Where everybody hates me

Well Bill got a promotion
He knocked Joe back down
Now Joe's everybody's long lost friend [laugh]
He's back in the crowd

Guess who's the new talk of the town
The new S.O.B.
The one everybody loves cuttin' down
Man it's a sight to see
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place,
Where everybody hates me

Well everybody wants to be the big dog
Wanna wag that big dog tail
But til' they are they wanna see the big dog fail

You pay your dues and you get your breaks
Then your the S.O.B.
The one everybody loves to hate
It just comes naturally
They all smile right to your face, and hide the jealousy
That's just the way it goes and I can't wait
Til everybody hates me
