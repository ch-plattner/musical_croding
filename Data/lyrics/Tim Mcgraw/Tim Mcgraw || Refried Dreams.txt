
Last Monday mornin' you left with no warnin'
I started goin' insane
Well I headed South out of Del Rio, Texas
With a hell of a load on my brain
I kept on goin' without even knowin'
How much your love really means
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico
Sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

This picture ain't pretty
I'm ragged and dirty
And wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Shootin' tequila
Wantin' to kill ya
And wishin' to God you were near

So full of your memory
But feelin' so empty
I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico
Sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico
Sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

Oh, I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams
