
No one wants to think about getting older,
They try to push you out before it’s over;
The same world that lifts you up can put you in your place.

What they call progress will never wait for me
And I should probably just go out quietly,
But I’ve still got something left, something left to say

I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up…
That’s when I need your love

Second guessing is just a waste of time,
I still remember how it feels to fly
And I’m still flyin’, I'm still flyin’
I'm still flyin’ and

I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up…
That’s when I need your love

You can’t live this way
We will find our way

I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up…
I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up…
I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up…
That’s when I need your love
