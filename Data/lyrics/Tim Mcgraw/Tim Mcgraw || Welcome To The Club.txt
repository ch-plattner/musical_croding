
I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' to yourself
How she slipped right through your hands
And in between all of the four letter words
You said you're never gonna understand

You gave her everything you thought she wanted
Now all you want is gone
You're just one of many broken hearted
Wonderin' what went wrong 

Welcome to the club
Don't be thinkin' you're the only one
Whose heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howlin' at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club 

Over in the corner is old Larry John
Gettin' over wife number two
And sittin' next to him is a regular here
They're as lonely as me and you
We got one thing in common when we walked in
A memory we're tryin' to kill
Swearin' up and down we'll never try again but We know we will 
Welcome to the club
Don't be thinkin' you're the only one
Whose heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howlin' at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club 

Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
