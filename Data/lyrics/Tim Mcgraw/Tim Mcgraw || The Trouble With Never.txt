
If I never think about her, I'll never miss her at all
Never wonder what she's doin, never give her a call
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird
But the trouble with never is never never works

If I never bring her flowers, I'll never see her smile
If I never try to kiss her, she'll never drive me wild
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words
But the trouble with never is never never works<

I know how to stay carefree, let no one get a hold on me
But I can't keep my hands off her
There's something different 'bout this girl

If I never let me love her, I'll never settle down
And I'll never put roots in this God forsaken town
And I'll never say I do or step foot in a church
But the trouble with never is never never works

I know how to stay carefree, let no one get a hold on me
But I can't keep my hands off her
There's something different 'bout this girl

If I never think about her, I'll never miss her at all
Never wonder what she's doin, never give her a call
Never see her again, and I'll be free as a bird
oh, But the trouble with never is never never works

yeah, But the trouble with never is never never works
