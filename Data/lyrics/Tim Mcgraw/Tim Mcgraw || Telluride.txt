
When I was nineteen I threw my stuff in the car 
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar 
Selling beer to the locals, just barely getting by 
On the tips from the rich kids, there on daddy's dime 
But when I saw her walk in one night 
I knew that I'd be all right in 

Telluride, the snow falling down 
I was waking up in that sleepy little town 
In her eyes my world came so alive 
I never will forget the moment she arrived 
In Telluride 

We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire 
Casting shadows on the cabin wall, drowning in desire 
Confessing all our secrets and laughing out loud 
So high up on that mountain, I thought we'd never come down 
It was a dream we were living in 
And I was the happiest I'd ever been in 

Telluride, the snow falling down 
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town 
In her eyes, my world came so alive 
I never will forget all those sleepless nights 
In Telluride 

Telluride, whoa-oh-oh 

It ended just like a movie scene 
And I had to play the part 
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave 
And me with the frozen heart 

In Telluride, the snow falling down 
Standing there alone in that sleepy little town 
In her eyes, my world came so alive 
I never will forget the day she said goodbye 

In Telluride, the snow falling down 
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town 
In her eyes, my world came so alive 
I never will forget all those sleepless nights 
In Telluride
