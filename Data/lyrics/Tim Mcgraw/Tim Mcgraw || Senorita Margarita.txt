She left more than just her lipstick when she walked out
Her memory keeps haunting me that's why I'm hunting you down
It's been a long time since our lips met
You've always been good at helping me forget
I'll regret it in the morning but that's not stopping me now

Senorita, margarita I'm as lonesome as a man can be
I still love her
I still need her
I'm just hoping you can comfort me
I don't want to do her wrong
I don't need somebody new
I just can't be alone tonight
So senorita, margarita, let me hold you tight
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la

She always comes to her senses with some space and time
And you're just what I needed to cool off this hot head of mine
I hope you realize this is a one night stand
I'm gonna get her back, I know I can
So let's keep this between you me the salt and the lime

Senorita, margarita I'm as lonesome as a man can be
I still love her
I still need her
I'm just hoping you can comfort me
I don't want to do her wrong
I don't need somebody new
I just can't be alone tonight
So senorita margarita, let me hold you tight
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
