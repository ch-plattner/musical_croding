Are you still there?
I've got a bad connection
It's pouring rain, 2 a.m. 
And I'm in the middle of nowhere

I don't know what to say (I'm saying it)
I don't know what to do (I'm doin' it)
All I really know is I know I need you, I need you

I just called to hear you breathing
Your last words before you're sleeeping
I can't sleep without your body next to mine
Yeah, I know I'm always leaving 
Breaking your heart, breaking even
I'm just a number in the middle of the night
But, I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line

Am I lonely?
Yeah, of course I am
Smoke green nights and red tail lights
Got me slowly going crazy

I don't know what to say (I'm saying it)
I don't know what to do (I'm doin' it)
All I really know is I know I need you, I need you

I just called to hear you breathing
Your last words before your sleeeping
I can't sleep without your body next to mine
Yeah, I know I'm always leaving 
Breaking your heart breaking even
I'm just a number in the middle of the night
But, I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line

I just called to hear you breathing
Your last words before your sleeping
I can't sleep without your body next to mine
Ya, I know I'm always leaving 
Breaking your heart breaking even
I'm just a number in the middle of the night
But, I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line
