
It was rainin' hard in Houston when I ran into her
I searched for conversation but I was lost for words
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashin' down on me
If it hadn't been for the pourin' rain I'm sure she would have seen

Tears in the rain
Hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back
If she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

Now, I'll regret that moment 'Cuz I didn't let her know
How much I still loved her I was hopin' it would show
But the raindrops and the teardrops ran together on my face
Now she'll never, ever know no one can take her place

Tears in the rain
Hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back
If she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
