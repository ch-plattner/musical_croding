
I was fifteen when my daddy died, mama worked two jobs just to get by
Seemed like a blessing when Harley came around so she took his name but I had my doubts
Didn't take long for his drinking ways to start showing up on mama's face
One violent night hiding under my bed I swore that he wouldn't see another sunset
Next day I followed him down to the riverbank
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away

I might have had a plan but he didn't know it
I might have been scared but I didn't show it
That's all between the river and me
With the current and the rocks it could have been risky
He might have been sober but I brought the whiskey
That's all between the river and me

I walked up to him and I said his name
Just so he could see the look on my face
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home
He raised his fist to me but I didn't flinch
I said 'I ain't your son you son of a bitch'

I might have had a knife in my back pocket
I might have pulled it out before he saw it
That's all between the river and me
I might have had a gun but I didn't fire it
He might have tried to yell but I kept him quiet
That's all between the river and me

That's all between the river and me

Sheriff came knocking on our front door
They said they found his body by the reservoir
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up

There might have been blood but they never saw it
Just a little mud on the living room carpet
That's all between the river and me
Well after what he done there ain't no wonder
I can't remember how long I held him under
That's all between the river and me

That's all between the river and me

That's all between the river and me

That's all

That's all
