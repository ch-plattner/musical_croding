It's a 3 day drive – if she drives all night
Say's she's leavin' at the crack of dawn
Well she might still be lyin' here with me
But in her heart she's already gone
Already packed up, the altima's gassed up
She's done put the map up there on the dash
I'm all tore up just tryin' to man up
Dammin' these tears up but can't hold ‘em back

(Cuz) she's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
Ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart

Got a waitress job waitin' in an ihop
Throw a rock and hit universal city
Got a glamour shot in her hip pocket
Hopin' somebody'll think she's pretty
By this time tomorrow she'll hit Colorado
I'll be drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of beam
Before she hits flagstaff maybe she'll backtrack
But I wouldn't bet that if I was me

(Cuz) she's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
Ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart

She was all mine
But now it's go time

She's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
There ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart

Oh she's breakin' my heart
