You got your head in your supper
And the eyes of your mother, baby
Locked on you
Everybody wants a piece of you, oh yeah
And your phone keeps ringing
Cause your cousin’s singing at the local bar
Everybody wants to be a star
Just like you are

You kept your face in the gutter for years
Kept your eyes on the road
You always felt you were meant for me
Baby now you know

Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away
Everybody wants to see you
And everybody wants to be you too
It’s funny how they put you down
But now they think you’re alright
And everybody loves you now that
You’re the one that got away
(The one that got away)

See you were raised in the town
Where the kids hang around the Pizza Hut parking lot
Everybody talks a lot, no one likes to do, no
And all the cub scout leaders at the local theaters
Said you couldn’t sing a song that well
You told ‘em all to go to hell
And went out on your own

You got a headshot picture to
Sell yourself to the world
You tucked your scars up under your dress
Like an American girl

Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away
Everybody wants to see you
And everybody wants to be you too
It’s funny how they put you down
But now they think you’re alright
And everybody loves you tonight
You’re the one that got away, yeah

Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away
Everybody wants to see you
They all wanna be you too
It’s funny how they put you down
But now they think you’re alright
And everybody loves you now that
You’re the one that got away

Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away
Everybody wants to see you
And everybody wants to be you too
It’s funny how they put you down
But now they think you’re alright
And everybody loves you now that
You’re the one that got away
(The one that got away)
