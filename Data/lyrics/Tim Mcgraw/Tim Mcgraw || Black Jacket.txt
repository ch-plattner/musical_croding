
I remember how it felt we were sittin' on the roof
You were in my black jacket drinkin' up the view
We were Romeo and Juliet smoking like cigarettes
All night long

Countin' yellow cabs we were showing tattoos
On top of the world we had nothing to lose
Fallin' like snowflakes crashin' out at your place
What went wrong

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket
Is a broken heart
And I never take it off
Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart
This black jacket has a broken heart

I still use your umbrella when I'm waking in the rain
I cant help but crack a smile everytime I hear a train
I never got your music till you left and made me use it
Just to keep you around, it's a small world town

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket
Is a broken heart
I never take it off
Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart
This black jacket has a broken heart

One day I'm gonna take it off
Send it up in my flames
Oh I won't even hear it
When somebody says your name
Nothing left to hide
I won't even hurt
Ya, I'll be alright in a white t-shirt
But, if I see you out tonight

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket
Is a broken heart
I never take it off
Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart
This black jacket has a broken heart
