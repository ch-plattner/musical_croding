
I heard it from a friend of a friend
You're livin' out in LA now
Got a studio apartment, couple blocks off the beach
Doing yoga in the evenings, you love the kids you teach

I heard it from a friend of a friend
You met somebody in a coffee shop
You've been goin' out now, for goin' on ten months
You already met his family, things are heatin' up

Don't you believe, anything you hear
When someone tells you, I still ask about you
After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true
I don't spend all my days and all my nights
Just missin' you

I heard it from a friend of a friend
You looked amazing in that long white gown
With flowers in your hair, barefoot in the sand
Your daddy almost broke down when he gave away your hand

But don't you believe, anything you hear
When someone tells you, I still ask about you
After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true
I don't spend all my days and all my nights
Just missin' you

I heard it from a friend of a friend
He didn't mean it when he took those vows
You've been stayin' with your mama, a couple weeks now
Been asking everybody about me

I heard it from a friend of a friend
I heard it from a friend of a friend
