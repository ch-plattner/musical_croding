I know you're mad,
And I'm to blame for that.
Yes, I'm sorry again,
For the things I did, the words I said,
If I could I'd take it back.
Why waste the wine in this glass,
The love in this room,
To making up, girl
We're so good at that.

Come on over, sit back down by me,
Let me have it, take it out on me,
Don't hold back, take your time,
Until you forgive me.
Turn down the lights, lock the door,
Leave out leavin' on the floor,
I know you're angry inside,
Let me love it out of you tonight.

I see that smile,
You're tryin' so hard to have.
Who you're tryin' to fool?
I know your game, I know you girl,
Damn you're sexy when you're playin' it cool.
Why waste the wine in this glass,
The love in this room,
To making up, girl
We're so good at that.

Come on over, sit back down by me,
Let me have it, take it out on me,
Don't hold back, take your time,
Until you forgive me.
Turn down the lights, lock the door,
Leave out leavin' on the floor,
I know you're angry inside,
Let me love it out of you tonight.

Why waste the wine in this glass,
The love in this room,
To making up, girl
We're so good at that.

Come on over, sit back down by me,
Let me have it, take it out on me,
Don't hold back, take your time,
Until you forgive me.
Turn down the lights, lock the door,
Leave out leavin' on the floor,
I know you're angry inside,
Let me love it out of you tonight.

Let me have it, let me have it, take your time.
Let me lay you down and hold you close,
And tell you how much I need you.
Let me have it, let me have it.
