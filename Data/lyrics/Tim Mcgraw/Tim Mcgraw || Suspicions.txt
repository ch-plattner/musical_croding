
I'm so glad that I met you baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feelin' that I'm losing you

[Chorus]
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh Suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes

[Chorus]

Ooh, suspicions

When I'm with you I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of

[Chorus]

Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Suspicions
Oh baby Oh darlin'

Cause I love her
Cause I love her

I love her and she loves me
Ain't nobody gonna take my girl from me
