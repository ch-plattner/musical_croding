
I don't know why I act the way I do 
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose 
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 

I got a life that most would love to have 
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad 
At where this road I'm heading down might lead 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 

The urge to run, the restlessness 
The heart of stone I sometimes get 
The things I've done for foolish pride 
The me that's never satisfied 
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 

The urge to run, the restlessness 
The heart of stone I sometimes get 
The things I've done for foolish pride 
The me that's never satisfied 
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 

Girl I know there's times you must have thought 
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed 
But you set your mind to see this love on through 
I guess that's just the cowboy in you 

We ride and never worry about the fall 
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all
