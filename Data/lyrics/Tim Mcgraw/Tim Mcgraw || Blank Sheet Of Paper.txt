
I'm just a blank sheet of paper
This fool's about to write you a letter 
To tell you that he's sorry 
For the way he did you wrong 
To ask for your forgiveness
For leavin you alone 

He's been lookin down at me 
It seems like forever 
He takes the top on and off his pen 
It's like he can't decide 
What he wants to say 
If he'd just tell the truth 
I'd be on my way 

But he just stares at me 
And I just stare at him 
He don't know where to start 
To say he doesn't want it to end 
Now its one hour later 
And I'm still a blank sheet of paper 

The sunlight is comin through the curtains 
He's almost asleep pen in hand 
There's a tear in his eye 
That refuses to fall 
If it would land on me 
That would say it all 

But he just stares at me 
And I just stare at him 
He don't know where to start 
To say he doesn't want it to end 
Now it's four hours later 
And I'm still a blank sheet of paper 

Oh but he just stares at me 
And I just stare at him 
He don't know where to start 
To say he wants you back again 
One broken heart later 
And I'm still a blank sheet of paper
