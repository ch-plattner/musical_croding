
Without me
Maybe you'd find somebody else
A little wiser
With a lot more wealth
And without you
It's true I'd be free
To go chasing all my dreams
Without any strings

But I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way

Hard times
May never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have
Will barely be enough
And babe you know
How cold the wind can blow
Love's never let us down
When we needed it the most

And I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way

Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Wouldn't want it any other way Any other way

Oh girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way
