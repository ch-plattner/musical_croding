
Well, I'm gonna have to get a new mailbox
'Cuz all she left me was a hole
And I'm gonna hafta get a new washin' machine
As soon as I get some new clothes
Well, I could close my eyes and run through this house
And never once stub my big toe
It was a man who'd never been left who said
You can't take it with you when you go 

Hell, she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass Lord, I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go 

Well, I'm sittin' here on this hard floor
Where a big, soft couch used to be
And I'm starin' at a bug on the wall
Where there used to be a TV
Well, I'd kill that sucker in a heartbeat
If I could find me anything to throw
I was so naive to have ever believed
You can't take it with you when you go 

Well, she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass Lord, I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go 

Well, she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass Lord, I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go
I oughta call somebody but I ain't got a phone
Just goes to show you can take it with you when you go
