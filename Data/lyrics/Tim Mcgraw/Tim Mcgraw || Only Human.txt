[Verse 1 - Tim Mcgraw]
The kiss that never happened
The call that never came
The hurt you mask by laughing
The one that got away
It’s all in a day of emotional traffic
Stranded, broken and tragic

[Chorus]
Finding out you're only human is hard
I want to change the world
But I don’t know where to start
And I am bold enough to believe
There is hope among the ruins
Finding out you're only human

[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo]
I tried to touch the sky
But fell right to the ground
Did my best to fly
But I just kept falling down
So many hopes and dreams shattered
Expectations broken and battered

[Chorus]
Finding out you're only human is hard
I want to change the world
But I don’t know where to start
And I am bold enough to believe
There is hope among the ruins
Finding out you're only human

[Verse 3 – Tim Mcgraw, Ne-Yo]
Oh human enough to forgive
Oh human enough to embrace
Oh there is hope
I am bold enough to believe
There’s hope among the ruins

[Chorus]
Finding out you're only human is hard
I want to change the world
But I don’t know where to start
And I am bold enough to believe
There is hope among the ruins
Finding out you're only human
