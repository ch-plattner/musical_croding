In the desert they’re hanging Christmas lights
From a cactus Christmas tree
And all the way over the sea
In Tokyo, they’re hanging mistletoe

And way down south in Mexico
They’re singing Feliz Navidad
And over in Leningrad
Where the white lights glow
They’re dancing in the snow

And the bells, the bells,
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy, the joy
They’re bringing
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world

From Romania to Pennsylvania
They’re watching for that sleigh
Over in China Town,
Someone saw him flying round
You know they can hardly wait
You might say Joyeux Noël
You might say Buon Natale
It won’t make a difference to me
No matter where you are
It’s gonna warm your heart

When the bells, the bells,
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy,
The joy they’re bringing
The bells, the bells,
The bells are ringing
For every boy and girl

Yeah the bells, the bells
The joy, the joy
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world
All over the world
