Everywhere I go,
They're starin' at her
Every man I know,
He wants to have her.
I guess I oughta be
A jealous man.
I look the other way
They're hittin' on her
Every night and day.
They telephone her,
They try and get to her,
But I know they can't.

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart.
She never lets it go that far.
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms.
She can turn every head,
But she never lets it go to her heart.

She walks into the room,
And everybody watches every move,
Hopin' she don't love me.
I know it by the way
They hang around.
But they don't realize,
There's more to her
Than what meets the eye.
That's why I'm certain
No matter what they do
To reach her now.

She never lets it go to her heart.
She never lets it go that far.
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms.
She can turn every head,
But she never lets it go to her heart.

When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms.
She can turn every head,
But she never lets it go to her heart.
(never lets it go to her heart)
