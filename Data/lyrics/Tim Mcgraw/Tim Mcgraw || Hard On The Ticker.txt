
I gave up pamento cheese
Domino's delivery
Whiskey sours
Apple pies
Finger-lickin' chicken fried
Are gastronomic history
I used to like them scary shows
But I gave 'em up a while ago
Don't do no death-defyin'
Rollercoster ridin'
Now days I just take it slow
Every since we started datin'
I been compensating
To keep from gettin' up
To heaven any quicker 'Cause 
She's hard on the ticker
Hard on the ticker
The girl is such a hazard that she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker 

Now, when she wiggles through my door
My chin gets heavy hits the floor
Silky hair, scarlet lips
Swingin' double-jointed hips
My blood begins to roar

And when she nibbles on me ear
It's partly pleasure, partly fear
Little dab is all it takes
To get my heart a palpatatin'
Feelin' like the end is near
I oughta get a policy
A double indemnity
It'd make my beneficiary
A whole lot richer 'Cause 
She's hard on the ticker
Hard on the ticker
The girl is such a hazard that she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker 

That's my girl
Yeah, she's hard on the ticker
I oughta get a policy
A double indemnity
It'd make my benificiary
A whole lot richer 
Oh, she's hard on the ticker
She's hard on the ticker
Hey, she's hard on the ticker
