
Your love for me, it didn't last long
One part right, and two parts wrong
One part love, two parts pain
One part sunshine, two parts rain

My friends told me you were slippin' away
I smiled and said I don't believe what you say 
As long as they'll always be birds in the sky
Your love, your love for me, baby, will never ever die
Oh darlin'...

Your love for me, crumblin' down, 
One part truth and two parts lie
One part rock and two parts sand 
One part stay and two parts ran

When you took one step I take two
I'm tryin' my best to hold onto you 
But love can't be love without some give and take
And lovin; you too much was my greatest mistake
Oh darlin'... 

Oh the love that's in you is all that I need 
But you just give one third to me
And all of your sweetness 
Wouldn't last much longer 
And If I had it all I wouldn't be much stronger 

Your love for me, it didn't last long
One part right, and two parts wrong
One part love, two parts pain
One part sunshine, two parts rain

Your love for me, crumblin; down, 
One part truth and two parts lie
One part rock and two parts sand 
One part stay and, baby, two parts ran
Oh one part stay, and two parts ran
