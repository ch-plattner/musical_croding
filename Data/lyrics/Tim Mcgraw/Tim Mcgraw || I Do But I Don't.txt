
You always come back when I'm at my weakest
When I'm fool enough to let you in
Sayin' how this time around is different
Asking if I want to try again 

I do, but I don't
I want to, but I won't
I am but I ain't
I could but I just can't
It feels right but it's wrong
And I've hurt way too long
So when you ask me if I know what I want
I do but I don't 

What resistance I have left within me
I lose each time you're holding me this close
With every bitter sweet kiss, girl, you tempt me
Asking if I want to let you go 

I do, but I don't
I want to, but I won't
I am but I ain't
I could but I just can't
It feels right but it's wrong
And I've hurt way too long
So when you ask me if I know what I want
I do but I don't 

So don't ask me if I know what I want
'Cause I do
But I don't
