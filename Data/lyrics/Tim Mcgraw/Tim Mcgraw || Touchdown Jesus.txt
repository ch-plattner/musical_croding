
I dusted off my Bible today
Read the words and read yeah, every word He said
He talked about forgiveness and a better way
I raised my hands above my head and I said

Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus

There was a little girl just down the street
They were prayin' for a miracle but runnin' outta hope
Some stranger was an angel and he gave her what she needed
You oughta see her today, that was ten years ago

Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus

That's just another story wrote away
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith
And it's touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus

Old man was losin' his bottle with the liquor
Ruined his name and brought his family shame and pain
Then he stumbled into church one day and he found something bigger
Beat the devil at his own game and he poured him down the drain, yeah

Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus

That's just another story wrote away
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith
And it's touchdown Jesus
Oh, touchdown Jesus

That little girl turned twenty one today
That old man well he found himself a better way
Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus
Hey, touchdown Jesus
Oh, touchdown Jesus

Yeah there's a single mom at her kid's graduation
(Touchdown Jesus)
There's a sinner on his knees down in front of the congregation
(Touchdown Jesus)

Oh, touchdown Jesus
Oh, touchdown Jesus
Come on
Touchdown Jesus
(Touchdown Jesus...)
