
The cover of a magazine, nothing but a paper dream 
Just another fantasy for sale 
Telling me what I need, what I should do, who I should be 
That stuff don't matter to me at all 

The sky is blue and the sun is shining 
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds 
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flying 
That's enough to keep me smiling 

Guru man on my TV set, selling the secrets to happiness 
1-800-Change-Your-Life-Today 
Dreams, I've got my own; I ain't looking for a yellow-brick-road 
I'm just gonna go my own way 

The sky is blue and the sun is shining 
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds 
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flying 
That's enough to keep me smiling 

Smiling (smiling), smiling (smiling) 

The sky is blue and the sun is shining 
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds 
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flying 
That's enough to keep me smiling 

I'm still smiling, gotta keep on smiling 
I'm still smiling
