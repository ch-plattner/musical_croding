Baby, I go too fast too far
Let's get it straight now
The way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
But I could be your wildest dream

I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade 

I get this feelin' that I should be gone
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to take you along
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in
And take a change on me 

I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade 
Don't even think about settlin' down
I ain't gonna hang my hat in no hometown 

I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade

I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade
