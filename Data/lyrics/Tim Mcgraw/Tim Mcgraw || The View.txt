The way I sing, the way I sing
All the boys want to love the way you wear your jeans
You do that thing, you do that thing

Hitting me like a laser beam
Our energy is a wild thing
I can't believe it's you and me

All of them gotta hate it when we up and leave
They don't see what we don't see what we say
You're all I see and all you see is me

So stay tonight, we've got the view, ooh
Up so high, we've got the view, ooh
Stay tonight, hey

Let em stare, let em talk
Let em say anything they want
Let em stare, let em talk
Let em say anything they want

They don't see what we don't see what we say

So stay tonight, we've got the view, ooh
Up so high, we've got the view, ooh
Stay tonight, hey

All of them gonna hate it when we up and leave
They don't see what we see
All of them gonna hate it when we up and leave
You're all I see and all you see is me

So stay tonight, we've got the view, ooh
Up so high, we've got the view, ooh
So stay tonight, we've got the view, hey
We've got the view, hey
We've got the view, hey
We've got the view, hey
