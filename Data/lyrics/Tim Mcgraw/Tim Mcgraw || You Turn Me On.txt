
Yeah, I swore off love
I swore off women
Devoted my life to huntin' and fishin'
I'd never be anybody else's lovesick fool
It ain't cool
I spend all my spare time Fixin' up
That old rusted up pick-up truck
In no time at all I'd have it lookin' like brand new
Then you 

Flip the switch on my doomaflatchie Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was as good as gone
So long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor
Ya flick my bic
Woman you tripped the trigger on my thingamajig
Can't explain how ya done it
But, honey, you turn me on
You done all the takin'
I done all the givin'
I threw up my hands, said "The heck with it"
I shut down my heart
Locked it up and pulled the fuse
Before it blew
All my emotions were disconnected
No sign of a spark Could be detected
I had nobody So I had nothing to lose
Then you 

Flip the switch on my doomaflatchie Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was as good as gone
So long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor
Ya flick my Bic
Woman you tripped the trigger on my thingamajig
Can't explain how ya done it
But, honey, you turn me on
Yeah, ya crank my tractor
Ya flick my Bic
Woman you tripped the trigger on my thingamajig
Can't explain how ya done it
But, honey, you turn me on
