
Here we are 
What is left of a husband and a wife four good kids 
Who have a way of gettin on with their lives 
I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot older every day 
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy 
I got to get away 

The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind 
I don't know why you gotta be Angry All The Time 

Our boys are strong the spittin image of you when you were young 
I hope someday they can see past what you have become 
I remember every time I said I'd never leave 
What I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be 

The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind 
I don't know why you gotta be Angry All The Time 

Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your door 
I never quite made it back to the one I was before 
And God it hurts me to think of you 
For the light in your eyes was gone sometimes 
I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone 

The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind 
I don't know why you gotta be Angry All The Time
