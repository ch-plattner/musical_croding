It'd be just another river town
Streets would have a different sound
There'd be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds
No dreamers chasin' dreams down

No tourists takin' in the sights
No Stetsons under Broadway lights
No pickers playin' for pocket change
No rhinestone boots on an old church stage

Hey Blue Eyes, Cryin' In The Rain
Hey Fire, Burnin' Round The Ring
Hey Crazy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

No ghost of the man in black
No long white Cadillac
No woman standin' by her man
In the place where it all began

Hey Good Lookin', hey Momma Tried
Hey Gambler, hey Country Boy Can Survive
Hey Jolene, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

Hey Georgia, hey Smokey Mountain Rain
Hey Galveston, He Stopped Loving Her Today
Hey Fancy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't have
Blue Eyes, Cryin' In The Rain
Hey Fire, Burnin' Round The Ring
Hey Crazy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

It'd be just another river town
Streets would have a different sound
