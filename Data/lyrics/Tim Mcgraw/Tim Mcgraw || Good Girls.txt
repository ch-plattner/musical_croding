Jesse called her best friend Jenny 
Said we're goin' out tonight 
Gonna chase the moon 
Right out of the sky 
We're gonna drink Boone's Farm 
Like we were seventeen again 
You can't say no 
As long as we've been friends 

Good girls 
Always walk the line 
Good Girls 
Never let you seem them cry 

Took off like a bottle rocket 
Through a field of corn 
And hell hath no fury 
Like a woman scorned 
Then Jesse lit a cigarette and said 
My man's been sleepin' around 
And I know who it is 
And Jenny's head fell down 

Good girls 
Always walk the line 
Good girls 
Never let you see them cry 

Next mornin' the paper read 
Two killed in a fatal crash 
The train never had time to stop 
They were parked right on the tracks 
The only witness was 
A weeping willow on a faraway hill when 
Jesse told Jenny 
Hey if I can't have him neither one of us will 

Good Girls 
Always walk the line 
Good Girls 
Never let you see them cry 

Cry, cry, cry, cry 

Jesse called her best friend Jenny 
Said we're goin' out tonight 
Gonna chase the moon 
Right out of the sky
