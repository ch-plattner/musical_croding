
I remember sunday mornings walking on the beach
And that place we'd stop for breakfast with the old red vinyl seats
The hours of the tide chart
The way the sunlight dance upon your face

That antique roller coaster you just had to ride
I remember how you laughed at the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail
Just like it was yesterday

And i remember how you held me the night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And i just can't remember why we said goodbye

Up and down this boardwalk lonely people sit
I know it wasn't perfect but nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searching for the wind

I just had to call you, i had to hear your voice
And tell you i still love you we still have a choice
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And i just can't remember why we said goodbye

Everything i do
Leads back to you
I know i just can't let us go

There must have been a reason, but i can't remember now
I know if i could hold you we could work it out
You're sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life
And girl let's give it one more try
Cause i just can't remember why we said goodbye
