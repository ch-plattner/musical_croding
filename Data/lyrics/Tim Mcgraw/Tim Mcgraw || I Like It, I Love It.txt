Spent forty-eight dollars
Last night at the county fair,
I throwed out my shoulder
But I won her that teddy bear.
She's got me saying
Sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear,
I ain't seen the braves
Play a game all year.
I'm gonna get fired,
If I don't get some sleep,
My long lost buddies
Say I'm gettin' in to deep.

But I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it,
I try so hard,
I can't rise about it.
Don't know what it is
'Bout that little gal's lovin',
But I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it.

My Mama and Daddy
Tried to teach me courtesy,
But it never sank in
'Til that girl got a hold of me.
Now I'm holding unbrellas
And openin' up doors,
I'm taking out the trash
And I'm sweepin' my floors.
Crossin' my fingers,
And countin' every kiss,
Prayin' that it keeps
Goin' on like this.

But I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it,
I try so hard,
I can't rise about it.
Don't know what it is
'Bout that little gal's lovin',
But I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it.

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch tv.
And she sits down on the sofa,
She'll move a little closer...
She can't get enough of me.

And I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it,
I try so hard,
I can't rise about it.
Don't know what it is
'Bout that little gal's lovin',
But I like it, I love it,
I want some more of it.

Come on baby..

You knoooow what I like...

Yeah.. I like that...

MMmmmmm... MMmmmm... MMmmm

Hey... Don't forget to turn out the lights...
