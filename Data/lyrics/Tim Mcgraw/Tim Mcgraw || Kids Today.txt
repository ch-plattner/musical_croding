Want something different than our mommas and our dads
Growing up ain't easy in a world that's going mad
Want to call music that we can call our own
Misunderstood, up to no good, and blamed for being stoned
Holes in our stories and tattoos on our skin
Sometimes standing out's the only way we can fit in
Somewhere in the future we'll be running from our past
Well we don't know no better, we just want to make it last

Kids today, young and crazy, making all the same mistakes
Thinking, baby, all we've got is time to waste, and hearts to break
Bending rules, there's nothing like that live forever attitude
Get caught up in the good old days until they're gone
Ain't nothing wrong with kids today

We don't listen, but we hear more than you think
Gonna learn the hard way how to love and how to drink
No we don't want to wait for anything worth waiting for
We ain't doing nothing that ain't been done before

Kids today, young and crazy, making all the same mistakes
Thinking, baby, all we've got is time to waste, and hearts to break
Bending rules, there's nothing like that live forever attitude
Get caught up in the good old days until they're gone
Ain't nothing wrong with kids today

Ain't nothing wrong with having fun
And running from the life we don't know's about to come

Kids today, young and crazy, making all the same mistakes
Thinking, baby, all we've got is time to waste, and hearts to break
Bending rules, there's nothing like that live forever attitude
Get caught up in the good old days until they're gone
Ain't nothing wrong with kids today
