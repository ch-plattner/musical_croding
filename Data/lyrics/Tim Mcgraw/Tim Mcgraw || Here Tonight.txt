
Got rambling in my boots
There's a lot of strings that I've cut loose
I ain't afraid of taking flight
But I'd rather be right here tonight
There's a greener grass on down the road
There's a million places left to go
With a brighter moon in a bigger sky
But I'd rather be right here tonight

There's something in the air
There's something in the wine
That something's got me feeling
I ain't packing up and leaving this time
I'd rather be right here tonight

LA to the Outer Banks
Coeur dâ€™alene (Quarterlane) to Pontchartrain
Yea, Colorado got me high
But I'd rather be right here tonight

There's something in the air
There's something in the wine
That something's got me feeling
I ain't packing up and leaving this time
I'd rather be right here tonight

No better place than where you stand
Tear up those tomorrow plans
You only get to live one time
So let's live it up right here tonight

There's something in the air
There's something in the wine
That something's got me feeling
I ain't packing up and leaving this time
There's something in the air
There's something in the wine
That something's got me feeling
I ain't packing up and leaving this time
I'd rather be right here tonight
