
I pulled into the shopping center 
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother 
Like ice cream melting they embraced 
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face 
All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard 
And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car 
I wanted to tell him it would be ok 
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away 

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 

Keep having this dream about my old man 
I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand 
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down 
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around 
So many things I wanna say to him 
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind 

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry 

I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife 
And everything that I hold dear in my life 
We say grace and thank the Lord 
Got so much to be thankful for 
Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says 
"I haven't had my story yet." 

And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that 
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, 
"I Love You Dad" 

I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry
