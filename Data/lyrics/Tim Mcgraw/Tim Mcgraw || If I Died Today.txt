
If I died today, 
Who'd turn off my coffee pot? 
Would there be a street parade? 
Would I just be an after-thought? 

If I died today, 
Would I still be a waiter? 
Could I fly around like superman? 
Would I make the Sunday paper? 

[Chorus:]
I wonder who I'd see, 
Cryin' standin' over me. 
Who would just send their regards? 
Would anybody say that "at least he's in a better place?" 
And who would get this old guitar? 

If I died today, 
Would my mama keep on prayin'? 
Would my buddies go out drinkin? 
Would my alarm clock keep on blinkin'? 

If I died today, 
Would I need to be ashamed? 
Would I be easy to forget? 
Could I live with my regrets? 

[Chorus:]
I wonder who I'd see, 
Cryin' standin' over me. 
Who would just send their regards? 
Would anybody say that "the world will never be the same?" 
And who would get this old guitar? 

If I died today, 
Would I see my room from Heaven? 
Would my family talk about me, 
At Christmas and Thanksgivin'? 

[Chorus:]
I wonder who I'd see, 
Cryin' standin' over me. 
Who would just send their regards? 
Would anybody say "what a good guy, what a shame?" 
And who would get this old guitar? 

If I died today, 
Who'd turn off my coffee pot?
