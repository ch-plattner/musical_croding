
I’ve been walkin’ ‘round, all over this town
Tried to shake your shadow but you follow me ‘round
Baby it don’t matter what I do
It all keeps comin’ back to you
I’ve been stayin’ up, I’ve been losin’ sleep
All them country songs sayin’ pour another drink
Baby that won’t drown out what we had, and girl…

I want you back, back in my arms
Back of the yellow cab, chasin’ kisses in the dark
Back, back to your place
With your red wine lips sayin’ come here baby
I don’t know what I was thinkin’ when I let you go
And I ain’t even gonna act
Like I don’t need you, miss you, wish that you would
Come on home
Baby I want you back
Want you back
Want you back
Want you back

The color of the night, baby it ain’t like
Like it used to be when we were burnin’ it bright
But then the fire turned ice cold
And now it’s all smoke and shadows
Wanna grab the phone, wanna call you up
Tell you that I’ll take it just the way that it was
Every little fight, the makin’ up all night
All the good, all the bad…

I want you back, back in my arms
Back of the yellow cab, chasin’ kisses in the dark
Back, back to your place
With your red wine lips sayin’ come here baby
I don’t know what I was thinkin’ when I let you go
And I ain’t even gonna act
Like I don’t need you, miss you, wish that you come on home
Baby I want you back

Tell me what I’ve gotta do
Ain’t no getting over you
Girl there ain’t no movin’ on
All I want is what we had
Baby I just want you back

I don’t know what I was thinkin’ when I let you go
And I ain’t even gonna act
Like I don’t need you, miss you, wish that you come on home
Baby I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
Want you back
