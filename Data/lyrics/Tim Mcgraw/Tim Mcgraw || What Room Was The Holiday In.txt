You've got a glow that's not a suntan
And a new gleam in your eyes
Oh, it must have been one great vacation
Girl, you look so satisfied

Tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

You said you needed a small vacation
Just a couple of days all by yourself
So, off you went in a new direction
And what you found was someone else

So, tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

What room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in 

Tell me what room was the holiday
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
