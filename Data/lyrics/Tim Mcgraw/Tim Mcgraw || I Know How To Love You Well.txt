
It's been a long time
Since we walked that aisle together
And you became my wife
And who would've thought
You would fall for someone just like me
For the best days of my life

I may not be a poet
Cause I ain't so good on words
I may not stand before you
Like a knight in shining armor
I may not be the best of singers
There's better guys I've heard
But I know how to love
I know how to love you well

You got your faults
And I don't need to tell you I've got mine
Well I guess they all even out
Wherever I ride
The thought of you turns water into wine
And somehow I lose a crowd

I may not drive a fancy car
I don't know what it's for
I may not be the one
Who gets to shower you in diamonds
I may not be a rich man
But you can't call me poor
Cause I know how to love
I know how to love you well

As we skip the light Fandango
From that old jukebox by the bar
Now honey, don't it make you wonder
How we ever got this far

I may not be a poet
Cause I ain't got much to say
I may not stand before you
Like that knight in shining armor
I may not be the best of singers
Honey that's ok
Cause I know how to love
I know how to love
I know how to love
You well
