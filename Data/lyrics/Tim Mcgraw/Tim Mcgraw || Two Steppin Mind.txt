Swingin' doors
Neon lights
Hardwood floors
It's Saturday night
Got on my dancing boots
I've got a cold Lonestar
I've got a two steppin' mind
And a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind And a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

It's happy hour when I get there
Pretty girls, man they're everywhere
There ain't no way to keep us apart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
Hey, I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
