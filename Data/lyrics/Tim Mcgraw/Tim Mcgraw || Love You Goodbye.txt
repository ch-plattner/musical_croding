He was thinking back when he was a kid 
His folks were divorced 
His old man high on something 
Came knocking at the door 
His mama wouldn't talk to him 
She said boy dontcha let him in 

She was cussing and pacing and wasting her life 
On that linoleum floor 
He took him back to his old apartment 
Turned off the TV 
His beautiful broken hero on the couch 
Passed out asleep 
And he put 'em to bed 
With tears in his eyes 
He said dad I love you, Goodbye 

He headed out into the night 
Seventeen years old 
Fired up that rusty old pickup 
Turned his collar to the cold 
And he headed back to mama's place 
Ready for his big escape 
And he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note 
In the cover's fold 

It said mom I wish I could wave a wand 
And make you smile again 
Bring back the man who stole your heart 
'fore the demons got to him 
If I stay here any longer 
Something sacreds gonna die 
He said mom I love you, Goodbye 

Took a lot of wrong turns on the road 
Finding his life 
By the grace of God he ended up 
With a little boy and a wife 
And the phone call came from his sister 
It was that old familiar pain 
His mother was at the doorstep 
Of heaven's pure white light 

At the end of the service 
His father came up to him 
Clear eyed and sober now he said 
Boy Jesus took my sins 
And I pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too 
With tears in his eyes 
He said son I love you, Goodbye 

His plane touched down in Texas 
He pulled out his phone 
Dialed in the number, got the machine 
Of his old man's home 
He said dad we got an extra room 
And your grandson has your eyes 
Couldn't say anything else 
Cause he started to cry 
And he choked out dad I love you, Goodbye 

Dad I love you, Goodbye
