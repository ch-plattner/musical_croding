
They wouldn't let him play the opry 
With whiskey on his breath
And it didn't take'em long 
to figure out what they missed 
He went down that lost highway
Underneath the purple sky 
A legend disappeared before his time 
Things Change 

They said he was the devil
dressed in gold leme
The way he shook his hips 
out there on that stage 
But before that faithful day 
He left Tennessee 
All of them were calling him the king
Things Change 

Well they like to call them hippies
outlaws with guitars
But they brought a little poetry 
To the honky tonks and bars 
They might've got a little crazy 
They might have flew a little too high
Somewhere somebody's playing their song tonight
Things Change 
(Don't you know things change)

Now some say it's too country 
Some say it's a little rock n roll
But it's just good music 
If you can feel it in your soul 
It doesn't really matter 
It's always been the same 
life goes on 
Things Change

[Bridge:]
Don't you know they change
Oh, things change
As long as this world is turning
Things are gonna change
Gonna keep on changing
Gonna change
