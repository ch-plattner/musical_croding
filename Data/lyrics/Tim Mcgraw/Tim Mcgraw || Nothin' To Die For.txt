
Stopped to have a few at five now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week had a friend ask you for your keys
You said 'no I'm fine'
You sure do act like you don't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the one's you take with you

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for

So what's the harm in a little fun
'Cause you're off to work before the sun everyday
And the inbox outbox locks you in and the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says 'man your numbers they don't lie'
The graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die

[Chorus]

Straight through that guardrail up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side

[Chorus]

Ain't nothin' to die for
Nothin' to die for
Ain't nothin' to die for
