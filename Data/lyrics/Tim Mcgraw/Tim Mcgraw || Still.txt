
There's a place I like to go 
Where I can here the cotton grow 
When that train whistle blows 
A dozen miles down the road 
All I really have to do is just be still 

There's the place I love to be 
Momma daddy my sister & me 
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983 
All I really have to do is just be still 

When this world gets crazy 
And tries to break me 
And I had all I can stand 
I can close my eyes no matter where I am 
And just be still 

There's a place that I can see 
Where my babies next to me 
Close enough to feel the heat 
All wound up beneath the sheets 
All I have to do is just be still 

When this world gets crazy 
And tries to break me 
And I had all I can stand 
I can close my eyes 
No matter where I am 
And just be still 

There's a place I need to go 
Where the stain glass windows flow 
Every part of me is known 
Thank god I can go there 
Thank god I can go there still 
Thank god I can go there still
