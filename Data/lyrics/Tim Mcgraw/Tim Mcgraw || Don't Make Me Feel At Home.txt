
Room number 10 at the holiday inn
I softly knocked upon the door
Both excited and ashamed
I slipped off my ring
Somethin’ I’d never done before
The door open wide she welcomed me inside
Took my coat and offered me a drink
I just shook my head
I sat down on the bed
I looked her in the eye
And said no thanks

Don’t make me feel at home
Cuz there ain’t nothin there but wood and stone
Loneliness is all I feel inside those walls
And I can't go home
Please make me feel the way
She hasn’t made me feel in way too long
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don’t make me feel at home

There’s no love at home
Is it right or is it wrong
Does it matter if no one really cares
When she took my hand
I told her once again
As I took the ribbon from her hair

Don’t make me feel at home
Cuz there ain’t nothin there but wood and stone
Loneliness is all I feel inside those walls
And I can’t go home
Please make me feel the way
She hasn’t made me feel in way too long
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don’t make me feel at home
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don’t make me feel at home
