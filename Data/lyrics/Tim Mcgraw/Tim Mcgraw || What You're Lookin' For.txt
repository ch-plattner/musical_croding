Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too
Just keep me somewhere in your young, wild memory
And whenever you finally get to
Wherever your heart leads

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yea somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

This has been coming down for a long, long time
I ain’t gonna change and i can’t change your mind
Just look back on me like a sun-soaked yesterday
And wherever your life leads you
Somewhere along the way

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yea somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

I don’t wanna slow you down
Don’t wanna hold you down
You’re better off without me
I just wanna see you smile
Girl i miss your smile
Wanna see you happy

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yea somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too
