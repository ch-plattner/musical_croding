Sometimes this road, it just keeps winding 
Round and round and back again 
But you've always kept me smiling 
Over every hill, round every bend 
Baby you're the one smiling with me when the sun comes up 
I got the wheel, you got the map and that's enough 

And we go rolling down this highway 
Chasing all our crazy dreams 
I've gone your way and you've gone my way 
And everywhere in between 
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground 
Just outside of some sleepy little town 
And set this circus down 

Sometimes I lie awake just thinking 
Of all the horizons we have seen 
And as another day is sinking 
I thank God you're here with me 
'Cause baby you're the one laughing with me when the sun goes down 
Living on faith and holding on tight to the love we found 

And we go rolling down this highway 
Chasing all our crazy dreams 
I've gone your way and you've gone my way 
And everywhere in between 
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground 
Just outside of some sleepy little town 
And set this circus down 

And set this circus down 

Maybe one of these days, gonna set this circus down 
Set this circus down
