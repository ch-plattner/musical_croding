She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car
I guess she took for granted
I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time
But it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

She said I've given you my best but I can't take no more
She said I've run out of reasons then she walked out the door
It's gonna take a lot of doin' to get over her goodbye
'Cuz it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind 

A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
