
I just walked in and you were gone
To your Mama's I suppose
It looks like you won't be back so I thought you ought to know
I found that note you left today it only took you half a page
I'm gonna grab my old guitar take a pencil from the jar and fill in the empty space

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do

In each line you're gonna hear it's my fault and I miss you
I know it won't be in time it may not even rhyme
But it has to be is true

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]

I'm gonna drink this bottle of ninety proof and sing this song for you
Like Kristofferson would do
