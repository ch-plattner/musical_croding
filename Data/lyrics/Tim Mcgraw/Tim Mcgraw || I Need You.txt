
I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I wanna ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you

[Chorus:]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain
I need you
Like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son need the holy ghost
I need you

I wanna get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I wanna dance to the static of an A.M. radio
I wanna wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up, 'til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you

[Chorus]

Oh, I need you

I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you,
Oh, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

Oh, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, too
