Hank Williams sang it 
Number 3 drove it 
Chuck Berry twanged it 
Will Faulkner wrote it 
Aretha Franklin sold it 
Dolly Parton graced it 
Rosa Parks rode it 
Scarlett O chased it 

Smooth as the hickory wind 
That blows from Memphis 
Down to Appalachicola 
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well 
Come on in I'm 
Sure glad to know ya 
Don't let this old gold cross 
An' this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw ya 
It's cicadas making noise 
With the southern voice 

Hank Aaron smacked it 
Michael Jordan dunked it 
Pocahantas tracked it 
Jack Daniels drunk it 
Tom Petty rocked it 
Dr. King paved it 
Bear Bryant won it 
Billy Graham saved it 

Smooth as the hickory wind 
That blows from Memphis 
Down to Appalachicola 
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well 
Come on in I'm 
Sure glad to know ya 
Don't let this old gold cross 
An' this Crimson Tide t-shirt throw ya 
It's cicadas making noise 
With the southern voice 

Jesus is my friend 
America is my home 
Sweet iced tea and Jerry Lee 
Daytona Beach 
That's what gets to me 
I can feel it in my bones 

Smooth as the hickory wind 
That blows from Memphis 
Down to Appalachicola 
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well 
Come on in child 
I'm sure glad to know ya 
Don't let this old gold cross 
An' this Charlie Daniels t-shirt throw ya 
We're just boys making noise 
With the southern voice 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Southern Voice 
I got a southern voice 
A southern voice
