Somewhere familiar, a safe place to land
That feeling you get when you finally come back
I got all these burdens rollin' round in my head
Once I round that corner girl you put 'em all to rest

I can feel it, feel it
Got the wheels spinnin', spinnin'
Pullin' me in like I've been here all along
Like I was never gone

Oh, Oh, thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home

And my life, and my mind jumped right off the track
You are the one place I don't need a map
I can almost see it, see it
Baby I need it, need it
Hold me in your arms like you're never gonna let me go 
And never let me go

Oh, Oh, thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home

I can feel it, feel it 
Got the wheels spinnin', spinnin'
Pullin' me in like I've been here all along
Like I was never gone

I can almost see it, see it
Baby I need it, need it
Hold me in your arms like you're never gonna let me go 
And never let me go

Oh...Oh thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home
That last turn home
