She walks over to him and she says "do you remember me?"
I think we might have met somewhere before
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind
But Hey, I guess you never really can be sure
Oh there's nothing like a true love 
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

Then an old familiar feeling
Wraps its arms around the moment
And he says so many times I've tried to call
Well you think it's been a lifetime
It's been two years since I've seen you
But it seems like no times gone by at all There was nothing like a real love To give you back the feel of someone just like
before And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

Oh and how far we'll travel
For a place to heal our hearts
We watched it unravel
So why's tonight the hardest part

Then he says the weather's changin
And it's icing up the highway
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road
So she says goodbye and then before she knows what she is saying
she says I wish that you didn't have to go

Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore
