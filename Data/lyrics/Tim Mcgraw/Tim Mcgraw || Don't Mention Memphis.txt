
Mister, you can take me into Little Rock
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck
I'll listen all night if you wanna talk
Just don't mention Memphis 

We can talk about your family
Politics and music and philosophy
Any ol' subject's all right with me
Just don't mention Memphis 

Or blue eyes
And light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me
From the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did
Was leave her standing there
So don't mention Memphis 

Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup
We'll make Texas with a little luck
And I'm hanging with you 'til the sun comes up
So don't mention Memphis 

Or blue eyes
And light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me
From the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did
Was leave her standing there
So don't mention Memphis
