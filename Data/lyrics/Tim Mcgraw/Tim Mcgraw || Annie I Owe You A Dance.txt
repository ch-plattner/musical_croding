I was running late again, picking up a few things
And there you were on isle 13.
I felt that old rush, when you saw me you blushed
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen.
They said you looked lost on the dancefloor,
With a lonely look in your eyes.
Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know
For once I wish I hadn't thought twice.
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado,
And I headed out to Tennessee.
Heard you got married and you moved back home,
Here we are again, you and me.

It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,
Shines like the ring on your hand.
Annie, I owe you a dance.

Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye,
Yeah loves, I've had a few.
I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,
But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you.
Remember how we'd talk for hours, keeping each other's secrets,
Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,
But Annie I didn't keep it.
Almost called you up, when I played in Boulder,
But I thought I'd just let it be.
Heard you found yourself a real good man,
Do you ever think of you and me?

It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,
Shines like the ring on your hand.
Annie, I owe you a dance.

So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking
Like I should have twenty years ago.
And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure,
And there's a song on the radio.
You give me your hand and we start to dance,
The cashier gives us a smile.
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say
"Momma, who was that guy?"
I shouldn't be surprised, the forgiveness in your eyes,
Gave me a second chance.
Annie, thanks for the dance.
