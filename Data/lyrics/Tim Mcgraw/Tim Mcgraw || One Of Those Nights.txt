
She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shaking, right into them cut-offs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now looking so fine
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time

She slides in and you roll down Main Street,
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, "Do you wanna?" and she says, "Hell, yeah"
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous

Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Crowded backyard, everybody's laughing
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, "Baby, let's go."

And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'til you turn on the headlights

Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights

Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will

'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be, hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh, oh
