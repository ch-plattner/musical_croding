Mary was the first of three 
Long black hair and sugar sweet 
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile 

She was barely seventeen 
Got a job keepin' dishes clean 
Planned to stay in this city for a while 
For a while 

Joseph ran a lumber yard 
About a mile from Olive park 
Quiet boy, he never had much to say 

It was love right from the start 
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart 
Had hopes for a home and kids someday 
Kids someday 

The angel scared her half to death 
She would've screamed but she lost her breath 
On a midnight there in the middle of May 

He said "Oh Mary, don't be afraid 
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made 
Call him Jesus, He'll light the way" 

She packed the clothes, he made the plans 
They had to go to Bethlehem 
But there was nowhere left to stay 

So in a barn she gave birth 
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth 
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay 
Sleeping on the hay 

The story's too long to tell 
But He walked on water and lived through hell 
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave 

We got a King, they got a Son 
Mary and Joseph were the only ones 
There on that very first Christmas day 
There on that very first Christmas day
