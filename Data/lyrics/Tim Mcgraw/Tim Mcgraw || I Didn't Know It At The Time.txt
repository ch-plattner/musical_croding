I thought that my first love would be my wife 
But in junior high she moved away from here 
I thought Johnny would always be my best friend 
I haven't talked to him, in 15 years 
Back when I had those fights with my old man 
I never thought he'd be....an old man 

And I didn't know, all those years ago 
How the years would go flying by 
Thought I knew it all 
But I was wrong 
And I didn't know it at the time 

I never thought good jobs were hard to find 
Til I let my pride cost me one 
I never thought my whole life would change 
Til I heard the doctor say, I had a son 
I never really thought that I was lost 
Til I heard my dying mother sing Old Rugged Cross 

And I didn't know, all those years ago 
How the years would go flying by 
Thought I knew it all 
But I was wrong 
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time 

Oh, I Thought I knew it all 
Oh, But I was wrong 
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time 

I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know 

I didn't know 

Ohhh, I didn't know
