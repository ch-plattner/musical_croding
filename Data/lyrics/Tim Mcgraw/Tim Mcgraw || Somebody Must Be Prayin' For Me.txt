She left Oklahoma for California
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat
Smoke was pourin' from that old Cadillac
But she wasn't turnin' back

Just outside of Flagstaff
Motor blew on her Coup De Ville
Just in time she saw a sign
There's was a Texaco waitin' at the bottom of the hill
And she said

Somebody must be prayin' for me
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me
Must be angels I can't see
Somebody must be prayin' for me, yeah

A boy about 20 climbed out of a truck
All covered in grease and dirt
She said, "Hey Charles," but he just laughed
He said, "I'm wearin' my daddy's shirt"
He stood there lost in her eyes
Then she got lost in his

As the years roll by
She would sigh everytime they kissed
And she'd say

Somebody must be prayin' for me
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me
Must be angels I can't see
Somebody must be prayin' for me

Sometimes she stares out the window
And wonders about her Hollywood dreams
But when she tucks her kids in bed
She softly whispers as they fall asleep

Somebody must be prayin' for me
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me
Ain't it funny how you find just what you need
Somebody must be prayin' for me

Somebody must be prayin' for me
Prayin' for me, yeah
