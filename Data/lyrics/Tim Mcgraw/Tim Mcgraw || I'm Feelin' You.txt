
I'm feeling you like a buzz on Sunday
Tripping on you like I'm falling in honey
That way you move gets me drunk on your groove
I'm feeling you like a stack of the house's money
That night on the beach, that one we didn't want to end
Hits me like lightning on the skin
Let's go there again, let's do that again

Baby let's drive, baby let's drive
Baby let's go somewhere, anywhere tonight
Just me and you, just me and you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
Baby let's go, baby let's go slow
Down any old road you want to go
Slide it on over til you run out of room
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, feeling you, feeling you

You're the heat coming off of that fire
Just when I think I can't get no higher
I'm floating off the ground, we're spinning round and round
Like a DJ kicking that funky sound

Baby let's drive, baby let's drive
Baby let's go somewhere, anywhere tonight
Just me and you, just me and you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
Baby let's go, baby let's go slow
Down any old road you want to go
Slide it on over til you run out of room
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, feeling you, feeling you

I'm feeling you girl like a shot of Jack
Hitting me harder than a heart attack
All the way gone, don't want to come back
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
Running all over me like a runaway train
Trying to hold on but there ain't no way
What you want to do, want to do?
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

Baby let's drive, baby let's drive
Baby let's go somewhere, anywhere tonight
Just me and you, just me and you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
Baby let's go, baby let's go slow
Down any old road you want to go
Slide it on over til you run out of room
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, feeling you, feeling you
