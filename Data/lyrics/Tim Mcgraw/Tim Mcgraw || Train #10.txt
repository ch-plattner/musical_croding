
I'm gonna ride that iron horse into the sun
I'm gonna say goodbye to you and all the things you've done
I used to be afraid but I know today's the day

I'll take the last train I can find just in case I want to change my mind
The last one out is number nine but here I am just biding time again
Waiting on train number ten

One more drag off one more cigarette
I've made up my mind but I ain't ready yet
Cause if that devil hits those tracks I know that I can't come back

I'll take the last train I can find just in case I want to change my mind
The last one out is number nine but here I am humming misery and gin
Waiting on train number ten

It's getting late maybe tonight she won't show up and change my mind

I'll take the last train I can find just in case I want to change my mind
The last one out is number nine but here I am just spitting in the wind
Waiting on train number ten

Train number ten
