My body burns like there's a desert deep in me 
A thirsty soul so unsatisfied 
But there you are like a river to the sea 
The one chance I have to change my life 

(A) Darling, take me away from (E) here 
Make it seem like we're a million miles away 
Another time, another place 
(A) Make me a different (E) man 
Move me farther than I've ever been before 
Show me that there's something more 

Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped inside myself 
Spinning wheels up and down, round and round 
Going nowhere just like everybody else 
With no touch, no sight, no sound 

(A) But you could take me away from (E) here 
Make it seem like we're a million miles away 
Another time, another place 
(A) Make me a different (E) man 
Move me farther than I've ever been before 
Show me that there's something more 

Give me hopes and dreams to fill my head 
Push my heart so I can fly again 

Take me away from here 
Make it seem like we're a million miles away 
Another time, another place 
Make me a different man 
Move me farther than I've ever been before 
Show me that there's something more 

Take me away from here 
Take me away from here 
Take me away from here
