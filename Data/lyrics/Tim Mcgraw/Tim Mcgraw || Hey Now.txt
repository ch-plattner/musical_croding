
On a night like this
Ain't what I'm lookin' for
The music's slow and the beer is warm
You came in the room
Put that record on
Started groovin' to that funky song

And I said, hey now,
It don't seem that late now
I thought the party was windin' down
Hey now look what I just found
Gonna stay now
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll
See how this plays out
Until you looked at me
I was just about to leave
I was just about to leave

Watch dancin' there,
Lit the whole place up,
Made me wonder where you came from, yeah
Some kinda paradise,
Some kind of heaven sent,
I know it might 2 a.m.

But hey now,
It don't seem that late now
I thought the party was windin' down
But hey now look what I just found
Gonna stay now
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll
See how this plays out
Until you looked at me
I was just about to leave
I was just about to leave

When I saw you, going for your keys
Girl I had to ask you if you'd dance with me
Yeah would you dance with me

You said, hey now,
It don't seem that late now
I thought the party was windin' down
But hey now look what I just found
Gonna stay now
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll
See how this plays out
Until you looked at me
I was just about to

Hey now,
It don't seem that late now
I thought the party was windin' down
But hey now look what I just found
Gonna stay now
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll
See how this plays out
Until you looked at me
I was just about to leave
I was just about to leave

Ooh but hey now, hey now...
Oh hey now, hey now...
Look what I just found
Look what I just found
Gonna dance, gonna dance, gonna stay
Gonna do just about everything
