
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
And I'll be over it by noon
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

Come tomorrow I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem yeah they'll always sell me more
But you're forgiveness is something I can't buy
Ain't a thing that I can do
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's the devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long hard bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink 'cause I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
If I don't break down and bring it on myself it'll hit right out of the blue
That's the difference between the whiskey and you

[Chorus]

Yeah that's the difference between the whiskey and you
