
I popped the clutch on that old red Ford
Her daddy would holler and run to the door
Dust would fly as we flew down
That old gravel driveway
And lookin' back I can't believe
He let her run with a boy like me He said "You better get her back by ten or there'll be hell to pay"
I can still feel her lips on mine
It's all so real
But lost in time 

Ain't that just like a dream
Runnin' wild and runnin' free
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind
Sometimes I long for just one night
Of the way I felt back then
But ain't that just like a dream
It always ends

Saturday nights we could all be found
Radios up and our windows rolled down
Hearts on fire and holdin' hands
Sights set on forever
We never thought those days would end
We'd never be the same again
Summer would be the last time we would ever be together
I never knew I'd wake up some day
In a brand new world so far away 

Ain't that just like a dream
Runnin' wild and runnin' free
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind
Sometimes I long for just one night
Of the way I felt back then
But ain't that just like a dream
It always ends 

Sometimes I long for just one night
Of the way I felt back then
But ain't that just like a dream
It always ends

Ain't that just like a dream
It always ends
