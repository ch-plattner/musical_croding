
That night in Phoenix when you stole my jeep
Then you brought it home with a new stereo, baby, that was sweet
Oh and how can I forget the day you gave me my red guitar
The best gift by far, was you babe I'm sendin' all that love that you gave

Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe

First things first, I want you to close your eyes
This may not even come close to that first kiss you gave me
But I'm gonna try
Oh and here's that ring you've been waitin' for all these years
As for the tears, that you've cried
When we made love the first time
Yeah I see ya cry

Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe

Well if what comes around goes around,
You've got it made
Yeah you've got it made

Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe
Yeah, right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe, yeah
