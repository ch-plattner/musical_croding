I thought I felt you touch my cheek this morning 
But I must've been dreaming 
And in the middle of the night without a warning 
I thought I heard you breathing 
Me and my so-called independence 
I've got this loneliness that's so relentless 

I guess you get used to somebody 
Kinda like having them around 
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy 
Bring you up when you're feeling down 
I never dreamed when I was letting you go that 
I would wake up and miss you this much 
I guess you get used to somebody, I guess you get used to being loved 

I kinda miss those rambling conversations 
Where we'd talk about nothing 
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations 
Baby that was something 
I should've been careful what I wished for 
'Cause I've got my freedom and so much more 

I guess you get used to somebody 
Kinda like having them around 
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy 
Bring you up when you're feeling down 
I never dreamed when I was letting you go that 
I would wake up and miss you this much 
I guess you get used to somebody, I guess you get used to being loved 

I never dreamed when I was letting you go that 
I would wake up and miss you this much 
I guess you get used to somebody 
I guess you get used to being loved 

I guess you get used to somebody 
I guess you get used to being loved
