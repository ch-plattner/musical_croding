
She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a mason jar
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
As a dirt road, fence row, kudzu king
Beating along this American dream
Wrecked out the truck when she showed up
She had a fire inside her faraway eyes
And I knew just where to take her that night

And we got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights

She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have
A shooting star that falls too fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Tryin' to find a song to make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my arms I knew
I'd never shine as bright as her city lights do

We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights

We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
And when the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights
She's city lights

She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
