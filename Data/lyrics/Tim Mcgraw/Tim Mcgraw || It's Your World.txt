It's your bed that we sleep in,
It's your smile up on the wall.
It's your night, it's your weekend,
And when it's over, it's your call.
Your rain, your sky, your sunshine in my eyes,
Your end, your beginning,
It's your world, I'm just living in it.

You leave your mark on everything that you touch,
You're painting my heart with your calico brush.
The air that I breathe, the water I drink, the dirt beneath my feet.
No matter how you spin it,
It's your world baby, I'm just living in it.

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey

I'm holding on for dear life,
For just one more time around,
Hoping that you might drop by,
The next time you pass through my town.
Your lows, your highs, I hang on your goodbyes,
Every second, every minute,
It's your world baby, I'm just living in it.

You leave your mark on everything that you touch,
You're painting my heart with your calico brush.
The air that I breathe, the water I drink, the dirt beneath my feet.
No matter how you spin it,
It's your world baby, I'm just living in it.

Cause I know it's turning without me,
And it ain't all about me,
It's all about you.

You leave your mark on everything that you touch,
You're painting my heart with your calico brush.
The air that I breathe, the water I drink, the dirt beneath my feet.

You leave your mark on everything that you touch,
You're painting my heart with your calico brush.
The air that I breathe, the water I drink, the dirt beneath my feet.
No matter how you spin it,
It's your world baby, I'm just living in it.
I'm just a map dot on your planet,
It's your world baby, I'm just living in it.

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey...
