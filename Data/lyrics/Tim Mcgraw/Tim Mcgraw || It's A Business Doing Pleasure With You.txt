I spent fifteen hundred dollars on your damn dog's collar 
Put new spinners on you escalade 
I swear I almost started cryin' 
when you brought up buyin' diamonds 
Lord I'm spending more than I'm getting paid 
You got more purses than Versace 
Got more rings that Liberace 
Fill your closes full of fancy shoes 
All my credit cards are cookin' 
Girl you don't know what your puttin' me through 
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you 

You got me walkin' past the fellas 
Holdin' drinks with pink umbrellas 
on some island that I can't even spell 
Then we slide over to Gucci 
Right before we go for sushi 
That's a version of my personal hell 
You just spent all day long trying on Louis Vitton 
There's a thousand things that I'd rather do 
Lord my mom would beat me senseless 
if she saw what I was spending on you 
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you 

Your gonna break my bank before too long 
I'm taking out a loan 
But when you turn your kind of lovin' on 
Honey I just can't say no, no no no no no no 

Your gonna break my bank before too long 
I'm running out of dough 
But when you turn you kind of magic on 
Honey I just can't say no, no no no 

Maybe I'll play the stock market 
Put some money in my pocket 
ain't no telling what your gonna need next 
I need to steal a Sherman tank 
just to break into a bank 
I pray to God this song will be a success 
All my buddies think it's funny 
'Cause I'm spending all my money 
On some honey like there's something to prove 
Cause for a little of your lovin' 
there ain't nothing much that I wouldn't do 
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you 
No no no no 
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you
