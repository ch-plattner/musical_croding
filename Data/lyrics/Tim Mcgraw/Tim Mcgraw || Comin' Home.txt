Say goodbye to old man winter
Say hello to sweet springtime
Cause I'm comin' out of hiding I'm gonna get it right this time
After so long being frozen it took awhile to thaw me out
I spent too long not knowing what love's supposed to be about
Now I'm finding out

[Chorus]
It's a lot like coming home from a long time walking out in the snow
Then I looked at you and knew I never knew nothin' and it broke this heart of stone
It's a lot like comin' home

Like a boat out on the harbor that's been battered by the sea
I've been through some stormy weather but you shine alight for me
Girl you set me free

[Chorus]

Girl I looked at you and knew I never knew nothin' and it broke this heart of stone
It's a lot like comin' home

Comin' home
Feels like I'm comin' home
