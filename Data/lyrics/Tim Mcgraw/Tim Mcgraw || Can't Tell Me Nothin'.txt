1986 Harley
Blowing smoke and sucking oil
My daddy said, 'Buy it and you're crazy boy'
You can't tell me nothin'

It took two months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
You can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
You can't tell me nothin'

Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, 'Boy, don't you come around here'
Can't tell me nothin'

They say be careful what you wish for
I want to be her man
Two babies and a trailer later here I am
Can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'

They say drinking will kill you
The same thing for rolling smokes
But that's two of the three things that I like most
Can't tell me nothin'

I know what the good book preaches
But I know how I am
I just hope somebody up there understands
Can't tell me nothin'
