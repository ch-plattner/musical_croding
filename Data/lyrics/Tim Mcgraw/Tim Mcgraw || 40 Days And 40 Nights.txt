
Well its been rainin' on and on
Ever since you've been gone
Those dark clouds keep rollin' in
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight
The bottom falls out again
Well I can barely keep afloat
I'm up the creek without a boat
And I've been adriftin' Heaven knows how long
'Cause it's been rainin' 40 days and 40 nights since you've been gone

Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been rainin' 40 days and 40 night since you've been gone

Aw listen to me now
I keep starin' out the window
Searchin' for a rainbow
To signal that the storm will end
Hey, 'cause I know that the rain'll keep pourin' on the pane
Until my saint comes back marchin' in
Oh, girl its been a long time since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been rainin' 40 days and 40 nights since you've been gone
Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause its been rainin' 40 days and 40 night since you've been gone
Yeah its been rainin' 40 days and 40 nights since you've been gone
