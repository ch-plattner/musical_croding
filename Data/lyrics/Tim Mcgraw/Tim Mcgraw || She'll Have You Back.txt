
Once upon a lonely time
She swore she'd never let you down
You held her tight without a care in mind
While she did her runnin' 'round
At first you wouldn't face the truth
You loved her too much to let go
And though the story had to end
You wanna be her fool again
Friend, there's something you should know

She'll have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
Back to walkin' on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just aren't meant to be

I understand how she can get to you
Cause she's made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time

It just don't make no sense to me
To play a game you'll never win
You asked me here for my advice
You say she wouldn't break you twice
Friend you'd better think again

She'll have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
Back to walkin' on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just aren't meant to be

I understand how she can get to you
Cause she's made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time

So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
