
This rock we're rolling on
Is like a circus ride that don't last long
Round and round we go and then we're gone
We waste time chasing ghosts
And overlook the things that matter most
We get so caught up in the maybes
Just trying to be somebody baby
I was slowly going crazy

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated

We amputate the heart
Cause we can't let 'em see the broken part
Water down the wine and jump the shark
We build our castles tall
Just so we can have the higher walls
It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated

We're all running after something
But if it ain't love it's nothing

It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some
I'm talking 'bout a ball of flames, son

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated, yeah

Overrated, overrated, overrated
