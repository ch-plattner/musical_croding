
Mama went to sleep one night and never woke up 
Daddy cried a tear into her old coffee cup 
Now all he wants to do is drink the hurt all away 
If Mama was here I know what Mama would say 

Carry on 
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong 
Carry on 

Little sister's husband ran off with her best friend 
Left her and the babies all alone again 
It hurts to know the hurt that she's going through 
But I know that she'll do what she's gotta do 
Carry on 
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong 
Carry on 

Nobody ever said that life was gonna be fair 
You're never gonna get nowhere by running scared 
If you look down deep inside you'll find the faith to make you strong 
Oh, oh carry on 

I try to walk the sunny side of the street 
Don't let no shadows tangle up my feet 
There ain't no troubles that we can't rise above 
With a handful of faith and a heartful of love 
Carry on 
Carry on What don't kill us makes us strong 
Carry on 
Carry on What don't kill us makes us strong 
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
