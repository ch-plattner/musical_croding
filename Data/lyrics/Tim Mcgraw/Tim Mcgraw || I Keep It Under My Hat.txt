
It looks a little weathered, so it looks good on me
But since you've left I'm wearin' this old hat differently
Pain, wind, rain and sun, it keeps out all but one

So I keep the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops come around
So nobody else can see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But baby, I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat 

Last night, I thought I'd go out
I don't know where my head was at
I had to turn around
Go back and get my hat
And I was glad I did
When I saw you with him

I kept the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops came around
So nobody else could see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But, baby, I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat

When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat
