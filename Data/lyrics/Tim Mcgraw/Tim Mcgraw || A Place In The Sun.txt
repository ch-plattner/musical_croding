Long ago, far away
I felt your lovin' glow upon my face 
Was it a dream or just a promise made 
What is my destiny 

Someday I'll find a way to shine 
Leave all these rainy days behind 
I know there's got to be 
Some place warm and bright for me 
I'm running out of places I can run 
Looking for a place in the sun 

Darkness hangs overhead
Close to the point where angels fear to tread 
I close my eyes and think of you instead 
And pray you'll be here soon 

Someday I'll find a way to shine 
Leave all these rainy days behind 
I know there's got to be 
Some place warm and bright for me 
I'm running out of places I can run 
Looking for a place in the sun 

Sometimes it feels like this whole world's against me 
And every beaten path
Is just another winding road that tempts me
Far from you and all that's true 
I've got to find my way again 

Someday I'll find a way to shine 
Leave all these rainy days behind 
I know there's got to be 
Some place warm and bright for me 
I'm running out of places I can run 
Looking for a place in the sun 

Yeah I'm running out of places I can run 
Looking for a place in the sun 
Oh, won't you shine down on me Sunshine?
