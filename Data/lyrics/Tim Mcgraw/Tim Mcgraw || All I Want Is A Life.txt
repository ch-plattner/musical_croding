
I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation
Ain't asking very much
I hate comin' home to this old broken down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all
But I ain't got enough

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps tellin' me that everything is gettin' better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder

Just wanna break even
Someday before I die

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life
