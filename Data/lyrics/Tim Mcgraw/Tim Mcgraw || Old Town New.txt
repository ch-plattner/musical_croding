
On a lover's lee with a freeway view
Sittin' on my hood
Thinkin' bout you
Going over in my mind
Every kiss and every fire
Yeah the fool on the hill
Is beating down another night

There were days so hard
I thought I had to go
I'd get in my car
And just follow the road
But this is my home
And it's who I am
And I know I'd stay
If I could make this old town new again

Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinking about you again
But the people I know
The places I go
Remind me of you
Oh, somebody come around
And make this old town new

There were nights so long
I thought the sun burned out
And there were girls so wrong
I don't want to talk about
I was burning up the night
Yeah, in an alcohol flame
Lightin' up my way
Trying to make this old town new again

Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinking about you again
But the people I know
The places I go
Remind me of you
Won't somebody come around
And make this old town new

Love goes wrong but life goes on
And I know what I gotta do.
I'm just hanging around
Trying to make this old town new
