So your top don't pop, and your roll don't rock.
The clock don't stop cause your feet don't feel the groove.
Your high feels low, and your cash don't flow.
Get up and go,it just ain't in the mood.

So put your arm out the window, let your hand start surfin'.
Ain't no thing, everything ain't working.
Throw a little love till the world stops hurting, keep on, keep on, keep on.
Everybody's going through a little something something.
Sing a little song with a guitar strumming.
Smile on ya brother, heard the good lord's coming.
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on truckin'.

So your dog don't bark, and your flame don't spark.
Your old broken heart, just can't catch a break.
So your flop don't flip, cause your hop don't hip.
And those suds ya sip, can't take the pain away, no.

So put your arm out the window, let your hand start surfin'.
Ain't no thing, everything ain't working.
Throw a little love till the world stops hurting, keep on, keep on, keep on.
Everybody's going through a little something something.
Sing a little song with a guitar strumming.
Smile on ya brother, heard the good lord's coming.
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on truckin'.
Keep on keeping on. Keep on riding down that rocky roads you're rolling on.

So put your arm out the window, let your hand start surfin'.
Ain't no thing, everything ain't working.
Throw a little love till the world stops hurting, keep on, keep on, keep on.
Everybody's going through a little something something.
Sing a little song with a guitar strumming.
Smile on ya brother, heard the good lord's coming.
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on truckin'.
Yeah keep on trucking.

Put your arm out the window, let it go where the wind blows.
Keep on truckin'.
