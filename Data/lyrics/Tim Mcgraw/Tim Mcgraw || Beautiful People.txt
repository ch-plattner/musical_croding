Carl's got a brand new haircut
Must have been the girl's first date
Baby blue front quarter panel
On his old dark green Chevrolet

Probably never make the pages
Of People magazine
But you oughta see them sick kids' faces
When he shows up on Christmas Eve

Dressed like old St. Nick
That missin' tooth don't matter a bit
But there's a lot like him around in every town

They're just family, friends, and neighbors
Doing what they've always done
Lovin' fathers, lovin' daughters
Lovin' mothers and lovin' sons

They gather 'round ole glory
'Round the tables and the steeples
The beautiful people
The beautiful people

Debbie Jo, down at the diner
Sunny side up, burned the toast
Raisin' up two kids solo
Can't afford no fitness coach

She was goin' to California
The year her mama got sick
So she hung around to do what she could
Had the first one and that was it

Then her mom passed on
But she still goes by the old folks home
Just to sit a while and bring a smile

They're just family, friends, and neighbors
Doing what they've always done
Lovin' fathers, lovin' daughters
Lovin' mothers and lovin' sons

They gather 'round ole glory
'Round the tables and the steeples
The beautiful people
The beautiful people

A wrinkled old man wearin' medals
That he earned on ... Beach
Sayin' goodbye to a grandson
Who was killed outside Tikrit

They gather 'round ole glory
Out behind the steeple
The beautiful people
The beautiful people

The beautiful people
Man, they're beautiful people, yeah
