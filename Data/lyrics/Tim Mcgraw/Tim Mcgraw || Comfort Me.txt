
Wake me my lady
Don't let me sleep
Open my eyes
To the wonders you keep
Let me look at you
See how you shine
I'll fall in love
Like I've done every time

Lay me in soft green grass
Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps
Gold with the setting sun
Walk me along the bay
Beyond the verdant trees
Carry me with your grace
Forever comfort me

You walk on water
Searching the East
The souls of the masses
Pass at your feet
Looking up at you
Tears in their eyes
Fathers of fathers of fathers
Gone by

Walk me down old main streets
Ride me down rusty rails
Fields full of summer wheat
Peppered with rounded bales
Steeples where church bells ring
Lighthouses by the sea
Reach out through gathered storms
Faithfully comfort me

I am your tired
I am your poor in spirit
Yearning to breathe
Breathe, free
Breathe, free

Lay me in soft green grass
Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps
Gold with the setting sun
Walk me along the bay
Beyond the verdant trees
Carry me with your grace
Forever comfort me

Walk me down old main streets
Ride me down rusty rails
Fields full of summer wheat
Peppered with rounded bales
Steeples where church bells ring
Lighthouses by the sea
Reach out through gathered storms
Faithfully comfort me
