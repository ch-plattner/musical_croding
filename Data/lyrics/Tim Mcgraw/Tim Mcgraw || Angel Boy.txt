
My mother said there's only one way
A sweet angel boy, narrow and straight
Time, it has passed, teachings they fade
Now their angel boy has gone astray

I've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath on my skin
Dip me into the water, wash me again
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things
Or have I gone too far now
Have I lost my wings

I found a priest, I spoke my mind
Asked if I'd sinned one too many times
He said "My son, you're only a man"
Then I said, "Sir, you don't understand"

I've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath on my skin
Dip me into the water, wash me again
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things
Or have I gone too far now
Have I lost my wings

God help us all for what we have done
We've lost our way, we can't find the Son
We make our beds, we seal our fate
Is there still time, or is it too late

We've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath our my skin
Dip us into the water, wash us again
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things
Or have we gone too far now
Have we lost our wings

We've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath our my skin
Dip us into the water, wash us again
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things
Or have we gone too far now
Have we lost our wings

Have we lost our wings
