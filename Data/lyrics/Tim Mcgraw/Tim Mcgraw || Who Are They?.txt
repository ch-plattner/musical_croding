
They say not to have too much fun
They say not to get too much sun
Democrat, Republican
I guess I'm screwed, I'm neither one
Don't say 'hell', say 'what the heck'
Do what's politically correct
Don't pray in school, but have safe sex
Isn't that what they expect?

Who are they?
Yeah you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?

They probably own the Village Voice
The Nashville Scene, The People's Choice
To me it's all a bunch of noise
Decided on by funny boys
They say who does and don't belong
They say our hair's too short or long
They say who's right and who is wrong
As if we'll all just come along

Who are they?
Yeah you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?

Well I wonder if they've got a life
A broken car and two ex-wives
Do they drink beer on Friday night
I wonder if they like to fight
And I wonder if they've got a soul
Or if they like their rock-and-roll
Where do they live, I've got to know
So I can tell them off
Or where to go

Who are they?
Yeah you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?
