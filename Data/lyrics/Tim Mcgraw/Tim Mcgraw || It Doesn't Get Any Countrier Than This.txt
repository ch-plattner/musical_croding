
Now mama I know you've always wished me the best
And I've found somebody and I think she's gonna pass the test
She's a country girl as far as I can see
Mama I hope she's what you had in mind for me

She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this 

Now mama I know she didn't grow up on a farm
But she sure knows her way around out behind the barn
And it ain't exactly chores she does at dawn
But she says she's gonna run me till the cows come home 

She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this

She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this 
Yeah, mama it doesn't get any countrier than this
