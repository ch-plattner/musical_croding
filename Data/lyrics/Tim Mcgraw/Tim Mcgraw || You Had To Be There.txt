
He sat down, picked up the phone and said Boy, I'm your old man. 
He touched the glass between the two, as if to shake his hand 
The boy he didn't budge, not even so much as a blink 
The man said oh come on, better late than never, don't ya think. 

He said I read it in the paper, can't believe you're 21, 
I can't believe some son of mine could do the things I hear you've done. 
He went on like some big hero, who flew in to save the day 
And the boy said if your here, to steer me right, man, its too late 

You had to be there, and I'm talkin from from day one. 
Thats the only time a man should talk through glass to his new son 
And you'd have to go back, and teach me how when i was nine 
Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time. 
I should have been learning how to fish, instead of learning how to smoke. 
I bet if you'd of whoopped my tail, i'd never thought it was a joke 
He said sometimes the will for doing wrong is way too strong for any mama's prayers 
You had to be there. 

The man said, boy I'm sorry that you hate me like you do 
The boy said dry it up man, we ain't making this about you. 
Its about a teenage girl against the world who was left there high and dry 
About a kid who might have stood a whole lot better shot at life, but 
You Had To Be There 
And I'm talking from day one, 

Thats the only time a man should talk through glass to his new son 
You'd have to go back and teach me how when I was nine 
Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time. 
I should have been learning how to fish, instead of learning how to smoke 
I bet if you'd of whooped my tail I'd never thought it was a joke 
Sometimes the will for doing wrong is way too strong for any mama's prayer 
You had to be there. 

Before the boy hung up the phone, he said they say me I'm out of time 
And it hit the man, right there and then 
My god son, so am I
