Bartender I may sit here on this barstool all night long
But I won't need much attention
I just need some time alone
So if you'll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best
You can just sit back and let the jukebox do the rest 

Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue" while I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

Let's start off nice and easy
Something like "If I Know Me"
And we'll work our way up slowly to "Fool Hearted Memory"
Yeah I've got all night long to sit right here and fall apart
So don't leave out one single song
I know 'em all by broken heart

Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue"
While I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

There ain't one country singer
That ain't good for a bad heartache
And for me there's nothing smoother
Than a good stiff shot of Strait

It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
