You're in the blue breeze blowin'
Across the sugar white sand
And the roar of the wheels
When I'm tryin' to land
In a Hank Williams tune
And a Coltrane song
In the dead of the night
And at the break of dawn
It never gets old
And it's always new
Everywhere I go
I keep on losin' you

In the words of a poet
No one reads anymore
In the shadows and sunlight
Crawling across the floor
In airport lounges
In motel rooms
In the Starbucks line
Under quarter moons
Between the little white lies
And the cold hard truth
Is everywhere I am
Girl I'm still losin' you

Yeah you kissed me one last time
Made that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

In Seattle and Vegas
Old rodeos
And lonesome ove
And the last pictue show
In a truck stop parking lot
Gasoline rainbow
The burn of the whiskey
Neon smoke
I close my eyes
And you're right there

Yeah you kissed me one last time
Made that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Late night drivin'
Wishin' you were still here
Turnin' that radio
Searchin' for a song to listen to

And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?
Guess I'll keep holdin' on
And I'll keep on losin' you
Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Searchin' for a song to listen to
