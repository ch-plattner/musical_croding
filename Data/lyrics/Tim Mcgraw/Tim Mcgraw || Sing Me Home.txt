
I fell by the wayside
I fell on my knees
Crying, why was I so hard to please?
I stood at the crossroads
Took a long look at me
Sometimes you don't know where you're from til you leave

And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way I heard my song
Let it sing me home

The sun on my shoulders and the wind at my back
I'm bound and determined to get back on track
To where the heart is
Where it's been all along
Sometimes you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Gone gone gone

And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way I heard my song
Let it sing me home

And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way I heard my song
Let it sing me home
