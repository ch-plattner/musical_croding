
I said is that you in the old picture back behind the bar
Leaning up against the classic car
Sure look cool, man, in your three piece with your snake skin boots
Hey that sure is cute
Little honey, sitting in the front seat
Touching up her lipstick with her hoop silver earrings
He said damn right I hung it there cause boy she takes me back
To the days with Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs

She was a queen of the red white and bell bottom blues
Back in the she'd write her number on a matchbook days
When you'd take her out for a drink and then you'd walk her back
To your Lincoln Continental or your Cadillac
She looks so good, cruising up and down
This don't take no shit from no one all-American downtown
Main street all lined up with shiny and black
Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs

He said that sweet girl, she moved on when time slows down
But I just kept on hanging around
And that sweet ride cost me too much when the town dried up
Let the bank take it back, paid in cash
For that old Ford truck sitting right out front
And this picture's all I have left of
And I always thought she would have but she never came back
No, she never came back

And I did so miss that queen of the red white and bell bottom blues
Back in the she'd write her number on a matchbook days
When you'd take her out for a drink and then you'd walk her back
To your Lincoln Continental or your Cadillac
She looks so good, cruising up and down
This don't take no shit from no one all-American downtown
Main street laying down that hard earned cash on that
Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs

She looks so good, cruising up and down
This don't take no shit from no one all-American downtown
Main street all lined up with shiny and black
Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs
