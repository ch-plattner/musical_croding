Ferris wheel, parking lot
Leather jacket, acid rock
Blacklight poster, seventeen
Cherry lipstick, dairy queen

[Chorus:]
That's what I think of when I think of your love
That's right
That's the kind of you I kinda need tonight
Life is a battle
Don't think I can handle it
Without getting back to the one
The one I want to run to
Cause you're the one that makes me feel like I'm
The one

Bought a castle underneath the power lines
Paper flowers still make you cry
Trampolines, holding hands
We're still jumping at every chance

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I wonder where I'd be today
If you ever walked away
I wonder, I wonder

[Chorus]

The one I want to run to
Cause you're the one that makes me feel like I'm
The one
The one I want to run to
Cause you're the one that makes me feel like I'm
The one that makes you feel like you're
The one that makes me feel like I'm
The one
