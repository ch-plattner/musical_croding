
Let's be honest, you're not flawless 
But you're as close as anything I've seen 
You're not the woman you envisioned 
But your life is not a broken time machine 
No, it's not that bad 
No, it's really not that bad 

A little midnight chardonnay 
Smooth the edges off the day 
A little taste of maryjane 
Makes you feel young again 
All those years around your eyes 
Always take you by surprise 
You've been living in a dream 
Forever 17 

A reckless lover, a father figure 
You search for both in every man you meet 
You're not a mother and sometimes you wonder 
If a son or daughter just might make you feel complete 
But no, you don't need someone else 
No, it's hard enough to learn to love yourself 

[Chorus]
