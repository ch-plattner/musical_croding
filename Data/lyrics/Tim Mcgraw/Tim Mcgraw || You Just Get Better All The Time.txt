
You just get better all the time
Darlin' don't you change a thing
Lately you're the only song I wanna sing
And you're my reason to try
You just get sweeter every day
The little things you do and say
If only you could see you through my eyes
You just get better all the time 

Oh, and I get the feelin' we can make it baby
As long as you are by my side
You're the music in my ears
The laughter when the tears
Are fallin' down in my life 

And on down through the years
You never tried to change my ways
You never made me feel
I had to say "I'm sorry" 

You just get better all the time
Why just today I heard you read my mind
That kinda magic is so hard to find
You just get better all the time
