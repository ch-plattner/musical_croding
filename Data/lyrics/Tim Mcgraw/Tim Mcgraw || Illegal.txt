
I put my money on love again
At a hundred to one
I dealt my losing out
I'll just try til I win
Or see how close I can come

Oh it should be illegal
It gets me so high
I can fly like an eagle
Night after night

I've known people who have thrown in the towel
Just cause they've lost once or twice
But it takes a believer to put all this faith
In the toss of the dice

Oh it should be illegal
It gets me so high
I can fly like an eagle
Night after night

Oh it should be illegal
It gets me so high
I can fly like an eagle
Night after night
