We are the black haired girls
With the streaks of red
And 10,000 sky blue seats
In an open air shed
Hearin that thunder bass drum kick
As the amplifiers scream
We are the neon midnight riders
On the field of broken dreams

Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise
Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries
Hearts get shot by cupid’s arrow
The road to heaven is straight and narrow
Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind close doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and willie keep on singin’
You can swing it you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western
Country and western

The sundress girls
In the cowboy boots
The wall street guy
With that Neil McCoy tattoo
The back road buck and merle traditionalists
Whole lot of love and never been kissed
The story tellers, city dwellers
Four on the floor with fine wine cellars
Spreadin' those blankets on the lawn
With a bucket of suds singin’

Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise
Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries
Hearts get shot by cupid’s arrow
The road to heaven is straight and narrow
Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind close doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and willie keep on singin’
You can swing it you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western
We’re all country and western

We’re northern and southern
Sisters and brothers
Motor city down to Mississippi
Vegas lights to Atlantic City yeah

Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind close doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and willie keep on singin’
You can swing it you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western
Fiddle and strings in the boom box beat
We’re all country and western
Hip hop flat tops and flip flop feet
We’re all country and western
Two lane roads to the city streets
We’re all country and western
Makin’ the bitter, baby, a little more sweet
We are country and western
