
Creek goes rippling by
I've been barefoot and all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started falling
Leading the way

I like it best just like this
Doing nothing all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreaming away

And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last

So let me kiss you now, little darling
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold wind, another season
Will be here soon

And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
