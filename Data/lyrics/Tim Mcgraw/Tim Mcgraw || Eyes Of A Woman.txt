
He was rough, he was tough
And he drank his whiskey straight 
He would fight every night if he didn't get his way 
She was kind She could find all the good in everyone 
And then one day she passes his way 
He felt reborn in that morning sun 
And saw her face, she called his name 
And from that moment he knew he'd never be the same 

What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you want to be 
I'd been down
Kicked around
The world had got the best of me 
Out of rope
Little hope I'd ever get back on my feet
She took my hand, said yes you can 
One look at her and I'm a brand-new man 

What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you wanna be 

When I feel the need for inspiration 
With just one look I've found my salvation 

What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you wanna be 
See the man you wanna be 
See the man
See the man you wanna be
