
Damn I hope no one dies on this night shift tonight
Always lit up like a Roman candle
Everybody comes in like they're looking for a fight
I'll have to tell his family as he rides off to Heaven
Then twenty minutes later I'm drinking my coffee down at the Seven Eleven
I'm workin'
Yeah I'm workin'

All these truckers out here drive with one hand on the wheel and a cell phone to their ear
Apologizing for something they missed or can't get to I'm sorry to my dear
Yeah but that's the way it goes and we sure need the money
This life of ours is far from perfect ain't it honey
But I'm workin'
Baby I'm workin'

So make the kids do their homework before you put 'em to bed
And there's dinner in the fridge make sure everybody gets fed
And I know I won't get to see you before you leave for your day
I guess it's the only time that we get to say 'I love you'
Baby I love you

Show the last kids on the school bus as I lay me down to sleep
And I keep hurrying and worrying and wondering and praying
For all my soul can keep
I know I couldn't do it if you weren't there
There'd be no home to come home to no reason to care

So I just had to call you before I faded away
I guess it's the only time that we get to say 'I love you'
Baby I love you

I love you
I love you

Damn I hope no one dies on this night shift tonight
