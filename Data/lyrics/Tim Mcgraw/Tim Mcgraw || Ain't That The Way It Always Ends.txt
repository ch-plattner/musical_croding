Johnny came home broken hearted
Said he lost his girl
He bottled up all the hurt in his heart
Punched a hole in the wall of his world 

Now Betty she was a blonde haired beauty
With an eye for a man who could spend
She stole his heart in a pickup truck
And drove off in her Mercedes Benz
And he said

Oh and she looked so innocent
Talkin' about bein' just friends
Oh and it don't make a bit of sense
Ain't that the way it always ends 

Karen she had a long time dream
And only one man in her life
He kept her waitin' but she didn't care
Cause he promised he'd make her his wife 

Now Billy he had a good thing goin'
But he let it go to his head
He got careless and late one night
She caught them both in her bed
And she said

Oh and he looked so innocent
Talkin' about bein' just friends
Oh and it don't make a bit of sense
Ain't that the way it always ends 

Oh it always looked so innocent
Talkin' about bein' just friends
Oh and it don't make a bit of sense
Ain't that the way it always ends 

Ain't that the way it always ends 

Ain't that the way it always ends
