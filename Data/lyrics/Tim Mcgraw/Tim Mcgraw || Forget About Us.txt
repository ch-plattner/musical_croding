I'm gonna drive on out to the river tonight 
Find a quiet spot, turn on my parking lights 
I'm gonna drink some beers, try to catch a buzz 
Turn my radio up and forget about us 

I'm gonna lay me down on the hood of this car 
Make another wish upon a falling star 
I'm gonna think again about the way it was 
I'm gonna close my eyes and forget about us 

I know it won't be easy but I've got a plan 
To just let my memory let go of your hand 
I'm gonna miss your touch 
But I know I must forget about us 

And when the morning sun burns across my face 
I'll put my shirt back on, get up and walk away 
I'm gonna climb my frame onto a Greyhound bus 
Take a little blue pill and forget about us 

I know it won't be easy but I've got a plan 
To just let my memory let go of your hand 
I'm gonna miss your touch 
But I know I must forget about us 

[Spoken:]
By the time I get to Phoenix, I won't know your name 
Those soft green eyes, your warm skin 
And the way you say "Good morning" 
I'll be alright
