
Your eyes say that you've been hurt before
And you can't take the heartache anymore
You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby this is me you're talkin' to 

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart you see
What can I do to make you understand
You got the wrong man 

I know you think that love will never last
And you see your future like the past
You don't want to make the same mistake
You think that I'm one more to make
But baby, I'm not him for goodness sake 

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart you see
What can I do to make you understand
You got the wrong man 

You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby this is me you're talkin' to 

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart you see
What can I do to make you understand
You got the wrong man
