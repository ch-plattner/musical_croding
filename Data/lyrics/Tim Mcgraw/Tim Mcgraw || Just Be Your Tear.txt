Don't know why he does what he does
Playing lost and found with your love
Trying to confuse you, use you
Girl. he's gonna lose you sure enough

Don't know why he says all those things
Always shootin' down all your dreams
He ought to know better than that
He ought to be watching his back
'cause you know you know

[Chorus:]
Girl I'd love to shine in your eyes
If only for just a moment
Girl I'd be satisfied
If I could only touch your cheek
Baby that's all I'd need
To make my life complete
Girl I know I can make you smile
If you knew that I was here
Wishing that I could just be your tear

I don't know why he cant find the words
Saying all those things you deserve
Girl if it was me there I swear
You know you wouldn't have to feel so unsure
About what tomorrow would bring
Don't you know I'd give everything
If I could just hold you like him
If I could be more than just friends
'Cause you know you know

[Repeat Chorus (Twice)]

Your tear, your tear,
Wishin' I could just be your tear,
Your tear, your tear, yeah..
Oh girl I love the shine in your eyes, in your kiss, in your smile, and your touch.
Girl I love that look in your eyes
When you say that you need me so much.
If only I could just be your tear, yeah, yea...
