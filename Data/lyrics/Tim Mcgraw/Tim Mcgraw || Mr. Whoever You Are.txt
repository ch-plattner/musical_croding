MR. WHOEVER YOU ARE 

There's a girl on the back roads of Tennessee 
And she works in the factory 
All day on the line then she clocks out at 5:00 - finally 
There's a bar - the boys treat her like a queen 
She's the 'belle of the ball' in blue jeans 
And they all get a turn just to turn her around the floor 
And they always want more 

She says, "Take me for one more song, 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Spin me around and pull me in close" 
Then the band slows down 
"Let's get the hell out of this bar 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Mr. Whoever You Are" 

They danced and melt to the heat of the song 
Their bodies feel like they belong 
And the boys hold on tight thinking, 
"I might get lucky tonight" 
And they're probably right 
Yea, they're probably right 

She says, "Take me for one more song 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Spin me around and pull me in close" 
The band slows down 
"Let's get the hell out of this bar 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Mr. Whoever You Are" 

They hold on to a ways 
She falls into the night 
And she throws back her head 
She looks up t'ward the sky 
And she laughs at all the pretty light 

And says, Take me for one more song 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Spin me around and pull me in close" 
The band slows down 
"Let's get the hell out of this bar 
Mr. Whoever You Are 
Mr. Whoever You Are" 

Oh Mr. Whoever You Are 
Mr. Whoever You Are
