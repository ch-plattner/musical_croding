Horses are running wide open I just gotta ride
To those honky-tonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs about free thinkin' and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

[Chorus]
She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you
If I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider
