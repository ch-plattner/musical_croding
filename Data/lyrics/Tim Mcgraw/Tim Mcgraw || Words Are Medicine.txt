For the light sleeper, the street sweeper,
Promise breaker, promise keeper,
The astronaut, the acrobat,
The underdog who is coming back.
Maybe you’re Hooked On Phonics or Mary Jane;
Coca Cola or cocaine.
We’re just a different kind of the same, yeah.
Sticks and stones can break you.

But words are medicine, words are medicine.
When I’m black and blue, I’m broken and bruised,
I hear your voice again.
Words are medicine.

The beautician, the mortician,
The blinded sided, the night vision,
The baptized, the chicken fried,
The rolled tide, the unforgiven.

For the girl who is lost in romance novels,
The guy who sees through whiskey goggles
We’re just a different kind of the same, yeah.
Sticks and stones can break you.

But words are medicine, words are medicine.
When you’re black and blue, you’re broken and bruised,
Just hear my voice again:
Words are medicine.

I do. I will.
I believe in you still.
I have a dream.
Imagine.
A shiny city on a hill.
I’m sorry. Forgive me.
I love you.
I love you.

Words are medicine. Words are medicine.
When you’re black and blue, you’re broken and bruised,
Just hear my voice again:
Words are medicine. Words are medicine.
When we’re black and blue, we’re broken and bruised,
I hear your song , my friend.
Words are medicine. Words are medicine.
Words are medicine. Words are medicine.
