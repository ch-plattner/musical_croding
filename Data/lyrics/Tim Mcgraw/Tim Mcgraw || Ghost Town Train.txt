If I could I would rewind the times she cried, I just turned around and walked away.
Wish there was a switch I could give then she'd love me like she loved my yesterday.
What I'd give to hold her in my arms feel her heart and wipe her tears right off her face.
That's just plain foolishness truth is life just doesn't ever work that way she's gone. 
Oh no, oh no, my baby's gone oh no, oh no. 
The morning sun stills the stars, shines her eyes and mine are laughing once again.
Her long hair flowing, I'm there holding her and hoping that this feeling never ends,
but it's just a dream inside my head, gone like the wind just like a child's red balloon.
Floating up into the sky so high and disappearing out into the wild blue, 
She's gone, oh no, oh no, my baby's gone, oh no oh no, she's a ghost town train,
a tear drop in the rain, oh no, she's two tail lights disappearing in the night, oh no, oh no she's gone. 
She's a ghost town train, a tear drop in the rain, oh my baby's gone,
she's two tail light disappearing in the night, oh now I'm all alone,
she's a ghost town train, a tear drop in the rain, oh my baby's gone,
she's two tail light disappearing in the night oh, (if my clock could rewind the time),
she's a ghost town train a tear-drop in the rain, (I'd turn around and walk away)
she's two tail lights disappearing in the night oh....
