
Fogged in in Dallas
On my way to LA
Staring up at the screen
All flights were delayed
When a voice from behind me asked
Stranger, how have you been?

Well, I was caught off guard
When I saw her face
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace
Then somehow I managed to say
Good to see you again

We caught up on old friends
Caught up on old times
But all through the small talk
It kept burning though my mind

Does she think about the nights we spent on Crystal Lake?
Wrapped up in a blanket till the break of day
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way
I didn't ask
And she didn't say 

Trading stories
And pictures of kids
Things we're gonna do and things we never did
Till stranded in that moment
Not sure what to say
Then she broke the silence
With her little shy smile
She brought up the weather
But all the while

I wonder if she thinks about Jackson Hole
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way
I didn't ask
And she didn't say 

We said our goodbyes
Swore we'd stay in touch
Then we went our separate ways
Knowing no one ever does

But I couldn't help but wonder
As I walked away
If things had turned out different
Where would we be today
So many times I've wonder
Does she think of me that way
I didn't ask
And she didn't say 

No, I didn't ask
And she didn't say
