
Think something's broken then again nothin's smokin'
Or shakin' or chokin' like my ol' truck
But I think something's broken
And I think it's worth notin'
It started about the time
She got all packed up

Could be my ego could be my pride
Could be my calm cool collective side
Maybe my heart's comin' eye to eye
With the truth she wasn't jokin'

Think something's broken
Cause I'm just layin''round hopin'
That maybe any momemt
I'll get on track
But I think something's broken
All locked up or frozen cause I can't go forward and I sure can't go back

Could be my ego could be my pride
Could be my calm cool collective side
Maybe my heart's comin' eye to eye
With the truth she wasn't jokin'

Think it's my heart
Comin' eye to eye
With the truth
She wasn't jokin'

I know something's broken
Just started smokin'
And shakin' and chokin'
Like my old truck
