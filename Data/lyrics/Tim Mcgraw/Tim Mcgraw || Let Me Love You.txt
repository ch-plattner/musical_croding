
Sometimes I close my eyes 
And imagine you're with me 
Chasing passion into the night 
All tangled in a dream. 

Oh if you could see my heart 
The way I feel inside 
You would know just how far 
I'm willing to go to get to you 
There is nothing I won't do. 

Show me what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Oh I want to taste your kiss 
Be the reason for your smile 
Touch the magic on your skin 
Be the one that drives you wild. 

Oh if you could read my mind 
You'd know you're everything I need 
You'd see yourself through my eyes 
You may understand what I'm going through 
Just how much I want you. 

Show me what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me love you. 
Let me love you! 

Show you what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Oh I love you. 

Show you what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Yeah baby. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me love you. 
Let me love you. 
Let me love you. 
Let me love you.
