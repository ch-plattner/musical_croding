
Well I was southern born and raised on the Good Book
My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took
And I'm proud to be my daddy's son
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit
Until the job's done
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need
And that's just me
The only way I know to be
That's just me
What you get is what you see 

Well they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me 

Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun
We live out in the country where we're free to roam
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe

The way I believe 

And that's just me
The only way I know to be
That's just me
What you get is what you see 

Well they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me 

Yeah they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me
