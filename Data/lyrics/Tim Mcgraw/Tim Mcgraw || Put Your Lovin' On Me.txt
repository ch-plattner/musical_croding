
There's nothing here to catch me now
I'm gonna fall anyway
It's just that kinda day
You might not know me good but you know me good enough
To make me okay, okay

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me

There's a chance that you might see something rolling off my cheek
But don't stop it's not you
Make me forget, be my drug get me high on your touch
For the night alright

[Chorus]

Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
