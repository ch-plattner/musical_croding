Bottle of Jack and a 45
Points it at his head
And he starts to cry,
To proud to ask me to save his life

Billy's in a limo
On the upper east side
Playing Russian Roulette
With the long white line
His wife gets a call at 3 am
Saying billy aint never coming home again

She asks me why?

And I said,
I sure wish you'd believe
That everybody's free
And I'll help you if you ask me to,
I gave every star a name
The sunshine and the rain
But i can't decide the road you choose
That's up to you
I'm only Jesus

Johnny had a good job
Rakin' it in
Cavier parties
With his well to do friends
Something was missing
From his perfect little life
He through in the towel
And he called me one night

Betty was an orphan
Like so many kids
They taught her in school
That i didn't exist
She had every reason not to talk to me
But every night before bed
She got down on her knees
Just to tell me hi

And I said,
I'm sure glad you believe
Cause everybody's free
And I'll help you if you ask me to,
I gave every star a name
The sun shine and the rain
But I can't decide the road you choose
That's up to you
I'm only Jesus

Hey your all the same to me
Everybody's free
And I'll help you if you ask me to,
I gave every star a name
The sun shine and the rain
But I can't decide the road you choose
That's up to you
I'm only Jesus

I'm only Jesus
I'm Only Jesus

Gotta have Jesus to see the light
Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight
Gotta have Jesus to talk to me
I gotta have Jesus to set me free
