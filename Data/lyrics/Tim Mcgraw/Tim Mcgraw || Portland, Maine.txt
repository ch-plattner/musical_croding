I don't want to be talking on the phone every night
Six PM, which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where you are, who you're with
Let's just agree, this is it

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
I don't want to know, I don't want to know

See I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
And you don't know it yet, but you won't come back
I ain't going nowhere and you know that

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

I don't want to know, I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
