No matter what happens, I see you on the other side 
There's too many distractions, waiting for the perfect time 
I know you're alright, by the friends you keep 
It'll all be fine, depend on me 

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh lover be strong while I'm gone 
And if you feel like falling, just hold on 
Because everybody knows what this all we had 
Everybody wants and they want it bad 
Oh, oh, oh lover be strong while I'm gone 

Just under the radar, a thread approach is slipping in 
On another stormy morning, another issue could begin 
But you heard these lines and these echoings 
You ignore them all till your wedding day 

[Chorus]

When you look and tell me love, just return 
I'll be waiting here for you, and you do 

[Chorus]

Lover be strooong [x4]
Ohh
