We belong together
like the open seas and shores
wedded by the planet force
we've all been spoken for

[VERSE 1:]
The hammer may strike, be dead on the ground.
a net to my hand, a cross on his crown.
we're done if, who we're undone,
finished if who we are incomplete.
as one we are everything,
we are everything we need.

[CHORUS:]
we belong together
like the open seas and shores
wedded by the planet force
we've all been spoken for

[VERSE 2:]
What good is a life,
With no one to share,
The light of the moon,
The honor of a swear?
The kingdom of men,
Is hollow within,
Without depth,
Without the care,
That it takes to make a perfect love,
The passion to find the other truth,
To visualize the straightened from the skewed,
To trade a common comfort for a view,
Would you try to live the way in which you speak?
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love?
Spread the word of consciousness you seek?
We are everything we need

[CHORUS:]
We belong together
like the open seas and shores
wedded by the planet force
we've all been spoken for

All this indecision
all this independent strength
still 
we've got our hearts on safe
we've got our hearts on safe

Someday when you're lonely,
sometime after all this bliss,
somewhere lost in emptiness,
I hope you find this gift...
I hope you find this gift..
I hope you find this gift.
