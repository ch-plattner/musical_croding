
Me and my woman, we both got the blues
But with so much to gain and such little to lose
Are we both getting played or do we like to pay for abuse

Down to a dollar and last bit of ale
But with too many sips, you forget the details
And you pale in the city lights shine, on the holes of your shoes

Every little bit, every little bit, every little
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
Just a drop in the bucket when you don’t have love

If I wake up tomorrow we’d both be surprised
If the car’s got some gas we’d both go for a ride
Hit our stride and some window shopping first, then stay out all night

Oh babe, you look so good I forget how to breathe
I wanna make that dress and give you a squeeze
There are reasons I am eager to please and easy to see, yeah

Every little bit, every little bit, every little
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
Just a drop in the bucket when you don’t have love

Take a little hit, take a little hit, take a little
Take a little hit, take a little hit
Baby get used to that hole in your pocket that’s the price of love

All the things we say
The promises, we make mistakes
All the things we do to live and love
And die
Dance with another
Never find another
While we have each other
While we have each other

Well I got some friends and they give advice
Some got big fancy houses and fantasy wives
But I’d rather be broke with you baby than live in their lives, yeah

Every little bit, every little bit, every little
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
Just a drop in the bucket when you don’t have love

Take a little hit, take a little hit, take a little
Take a little hit, take a little hit
Baby get used to that hole in your pocket, that’s the price of love
