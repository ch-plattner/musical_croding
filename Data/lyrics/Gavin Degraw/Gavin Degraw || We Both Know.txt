[Verse 1:]
[Gavin]
They all say it
All the ones that made it
Once you find the one you claim it
But you're gonna have to fight

[Colbie]
When I think back
The things that threw us off track
We handled like a heart attack
Cause we didn't see the light

[Both]
Oh, yeah, now

[Chorus:]
[Both]
We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong
Now that we spent some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know

[Verse 2:]
[Gavin]
From this moment
Forget what we were scared of
Say we're never giving up
You say you'll always

[Both]
Try to be my

[Both]
Helping hand
Try to be the one who understands
When things don't go as you've planned
We're still worth it all

Oh, yeah, now...

[Chorus:]
[Both]
We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong
Now that we've spent some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know

[Bridge:]
[Both]
What we're scared of (what we're scared of)
And what dreams are made of (what dreams are made of)
They can take us further than what anybody can see, yeah

[Chorus:]
[Both]
We both, know our
Own limitations, and that's why we're strong
Now that we've spent some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark

We both (we both), know our (know our)
Own limitations, and that's why we're strong
Now that we've spent some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know

[Both]
We both know.
