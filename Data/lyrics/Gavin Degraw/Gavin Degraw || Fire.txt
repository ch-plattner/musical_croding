It's dreams are made to be caught
And friends can never be bought
Doesn't matter how long it's been
I know you'll always jump in
'Cause we don't know how to quit

Let's start a riot tonight
A pack of lions tonight
In this world, he who stops, won't get anything he wants
Play like the top one percent
Till nothings left to be spent
Take it all, ours to take, celebrate because

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh we on fire
We on fire
Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we on fire
We on fire

Get up, stand up, throw your hands up
Welcome to the other land of
Dreamers brothers sisters others
Yeah we on fire like that

Oh the bond is deeper than skin
The kind of club that we're in
The kind of love that we give
Oh ever since the dawn of mankind
We all belong to a tribe
It's good to know this one's mine

Let's start a riot tonight
A pack of lions tonight
In this world, he who stops, won't get anything he wants
Play like the top one percent
Till nothings left to be spent
We don't care, we won't stop, call your mothers, call the cops

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh we on fire
We on fire
Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we on fire
We on fire

Get up, stand up, throw your hands up
Welcome to the other land of
Dreamers brothers sisters others
Yeah we on fire like that

Ohh... (fire, fire)
Ooooh... (fire, fire)
And nothings gonna be the same (fire fire, fire fire, fire fire)

Oh! We're the champions

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh we on fire
We on fire
Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we on fire
We on fire
