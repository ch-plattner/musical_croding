
Tell 'em, "Say no to drugs"
"Substances make you dumb"
Then you say, "give 'em some"
Are you the victim
Of this experience
Child experiment
Teacher's predicament?
You're in THE SYSTEM

And if you don't walk the line
You can walk the plank
Your older brother (government)
Wants to control your mind
You're more useful blank

[Pre-chorus]
Medicate the kids
Feathers turn to quills
Pump 'em full of training fluids
Powders and pills
There's nothing you can't flush out
And nothing you can't kill

[Chorus]
Why don't you just back off of us
Before we go crazy?
I'm gonna tell you,
"No way,
This ain't fair play,
Just don't medicate me"

Tell 'em, "Say no to drugs"
"Substances make you dumb"
Unless you get 'em from
Someone who loves you
One who knows best for you
Paid for those tests for you
Knows how to get you through
When it's above you
And you can't get on top
Cause it's high to climb,
You hear them saying,
"Don't make me call the cops"
Every other time

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And there's a long line
Flowing from prescription aisles
Filed through legal means
So we can alter the child
For his protection
Tie him to extension cords,
This is the age of discipline

[Chorus]
