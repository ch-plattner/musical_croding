Walk in like a fistful of bottle rockets
It's only the flints on my back pocket
You never seen what you gonna see
And you won't believe when you see it
But it's only me

I'm your leading man, uh-huh
Up front like the leader of the band, yeah
The one thing ya must understand, uh-huh
You got to draw a line in the sand, yeah
For the leading man

Rip rollin' on the rug and it's alright
Slip slidin' in the truck and it's all night
You're gonna feel what you're gonna feel
And it's gonna feel, yeah, feel alright, yeah

I'm your leading man, uh-huh
Up front like the leader of the band, yeah
The one thing ya must understand, uh-huh
You got to draw a line in the sand, yeah
For the leading man

Got those alligators on the corner acting up
And the bravest has a hole on the back of his drum
He's a snake skin lizard to the tip of his tongue
Hold my gun and tell me where you're from

I'm your leading man, uh-huh
Up front like the leader of the band, mmm-hmm
The one thing ya must understand, yeah
I got to draw a line in the sand, yeah
I'm the leading man

All you suckers get the back of my hand
Dudes run while the pretty girls stare
Don't hate me for the way the chips land

I'm you're leading man
Up front like the leader of the band
