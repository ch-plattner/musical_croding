
I saw you there last night
Standing in the dark
You were acting so in love
With your hand upon his heart
But you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
I've had other options too
But all I want is you
Girl, your body fits me like a glove
And you showered me with words of love
While you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
It's not my style to lay it on the line
But you don't leave me with a choice this time
Why weren't you true
You know I, I trusted you
When you were just friends
At least that's what you said
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
You were just friends
Now I know better from his fingers in your hair
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
I'll forgive you for what you've done
If you say that I'm the one
I'll forgive you for what you've done 
If you say that I'm the one
I'll forgive you
