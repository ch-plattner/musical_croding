
Hey, from the first time that I asked your name
It's like a drug that went straight to the vein
I feel a high coming on, and it's all because of you

We, could get it going like one, two
Freeze, put up your hands and surrender to me
I know I'm easy to read, and it's all because of you

I don't care where we sleep tonight
I don't care if it's in or outside
You know what to do
Make a move

You could throw away your phone
Make believe that we're all alone
I'm talking to you
Make a move, 'cause I'm ready

I've been thinking about something you once said
That life is short, so let go of regrets
So then I take your advice, and I bet it all on you

Now, you're giving sexy a whole new name
Yeah what I'm feeling is hard to explain
I'm thinking we're overdue, and I bet it all on you

I don't care where we sleep tonight
I don't care if it's in or outside
You know what to do
Make a move

You could throw away your phone
Make believe that we're all alone
I'm talking to you
Make a move, 'cause I'm ready

I'm aware of what you've gone through
Not afraid to say I've fallen for you
If you need someone to talk to
I've got the time

I don't care where we sleep tonight
I don't care if it's in or outside
You know what to do
Make a move

You could throw away your phone
Make believe that we're all alone
I'm talking to you
Make a move, 'cause I'm ready
