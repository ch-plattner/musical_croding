
You
You don't know how lucky you are
Hanging with that girl on your arm
But soon enough I'm taking my shot

Bang!
Once I get 'em locked in my sight
Doesn't mean I wasn't alright
I'm just seeing something I like
Woo hoo

I just wanna take
Someone else's holiday
Sometimes the grass is greener
And someone else's sugar,
Someone else's sugar's
Sweeter

You,
Went to school and found out you're dumb
Maybe you just had too much fun
Fell in love and think it's the one

You're like an angel
Got me feeling like a devil
I wanna give you something
If you promise that you won't tell
Woo hoo

I just wanna take
Someone else's holiday
Sometimes the grass is greener
And someone else's sugar,
Someone else's sugar's
Sweeter

I'ma recommend
You take that body to the other end
I really like you but I can't be friends
Not with these hands of mine

I just wanna take
Someone else's holiday
Sometimes the grass is greener
And someone else's sugar,
Someone else's sugar

I just wanna take
Someone else's holiday
Sometimes the grass is greener
And someone else's sugar,
Someone else's sugar's
Sweeter.
