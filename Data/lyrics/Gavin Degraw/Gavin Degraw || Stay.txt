
You don't have to be part of the problem 
I just need a second chance 
I just need a second chance 
Instead of leaving me standing in sorrow 
I know that you'll understand 
I hope then you'll understand 
I know that I was wrong 
But just don't walk away 

[Chorus:]
Oh won't you stay 
I need you need you here 
When you're with me 
All others disappear 
I'll follow close 
So close I'll almost touch 
I need your love 
But it never hurt this much 

I don't wanna be someone who's searching 
Finally met someone 
I finally met someone 
There's a couple things I'm still learning 
Just gotta figure out 
But you need someone who knows 
I came to you tonight 
But now you're just walking away 

[Chorus]

Don't get caught up in me feeling off course today 
You can take a minute before you go slipping away 
I know I took some time but I realized my mistake 
You don't have to be part of the problem 
I just need a second chance 

[Chorus]

I need your lovin' arms at night, but it never hurt this much 
You don't have to be part of the problem 
I just need a second chance
