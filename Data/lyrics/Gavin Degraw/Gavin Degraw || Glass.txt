Fool you made the girl fall in love
You said those beautiful things
She thought you spoke things you mean

Caress her skin like it's glass
She hears your voice making plans
And sees your face in her hands

You don't wanna see somebody beg
As you feel her heart surrender you begin to fall
How do you say that something's through
When it never even started, at least not for you

You breathe her air and you leave
You keep your mind on yourself
And lie the glass on the shelf
After the heavenly speech
Your body throws holy heat
The angels sing when our eyes meet

It wasn't a lie but it wasn't true
I just wanted to make him feel good
Just wanted you near
I wasn't prepared I wasn't thinking of you
That you could actually love me
It never should have started

She's dreaming back on the past
Every opinion agreed
Doesn't know what to believe

It must have been for a cause
Our lives have so many doors
Don't think about him anymore

But it was the kiss, it took me away
It's like he knew that I am fragile
He handled me like glass

And it hurts
But it's what I deserve
Because I should have been more careful
With these others that I've handled
I should have been more

And knowing this I know that he'll get his
But I don't want the man to suffer
Not the way I am

'Cause deep down I know that he's glass too
And it really doesn't matter until it's happenin' to you
Everybody breaks, everybody breaks sometimes, sometimes
