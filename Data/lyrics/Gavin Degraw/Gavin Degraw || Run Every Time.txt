
I got troubles that I can’t hide
So many and it’s turning on the inside out
I know a woman’s nature
There’s nothing you can save here
Me, I run every time

We got two tickets but the one way
And I went with it so I can’t say no
I lit a fuse I can’t stop
I opened doors I can’t lock
Still, I never meant to be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

So I told her get a head start
Like the last one I didn’t have the heart
To tell her straight
I know how she’ll receive it
And I can’t bear to see it
That’s why I never meant to be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

And I hope she sees
It’s not her, it’s just me
And I’m so sorry
To be this close

And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

I’m close and let it slip away
I keep dragging my feet till I finally miss the last train
Ooh, she’s ready, I’m not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time
I run every time
I run every time I’m close
