I’m gonna try
Try like a mother, I’ll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she’ll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, Well I can't put up with that
So I’m gonna try
Try til I get it back

You don’t know what she means to me
My reality and my fantasy
On the wave of confidence and gin
Like a hurricane, I come crashing in

But oh, man this thing is moving too slow
Damn I think I’m losing control
‘Cause I just took a flight
To make it here tonight to say that I

I’m gonna try
Try like a mother, I’ll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she’ll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well I can’t put up with that
So I’m gonna try
Try til I get it back

Listen, I’mma tell you once
From an honest guy, who has screwed it up
Celebrate the one you’re with
A little take and give, never hurt no one 

But oh, now I’m standing out in the cold
Trying to find the heart that got stole
‘Cause I just took a flight
To make it here tonight to say that I

I’m gonna try
Try like a mother, I’ll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she’ll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well I can’t put up with that
So I’m gonna try
Try til I get it back

If she placed a badge
Oh no
The chances that your wasting until then
Would you, stand it?

I’m gonna try
Try like a mother, I’ll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she’ll be coming down

I’m gonna try
Try like a mother, I’ll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she’ll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well I can’t put up with that
So I’m gonna try
Try til I get it back
