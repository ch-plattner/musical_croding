I know you got a wild side,
That I don't wanna hold back
And everyone I ever had,
Was just the means to an end
Now we're standing at the edge,
We've never been here before
So are we gonna give in?
What happens if we fall?

Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
We've been way too cool for this
But it's just too strong to fight
So tell me who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight?

Politics and presidentsâ€“
It's like they're building a wall.
I got my own line of defense,
Somehow you broke through it all.
At the bottom of an empty bottle,
Is where the truth starts to spill.
Don't wanna wake up with regret,
From this feeling we can't kill.

Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
We've been way too cool for this
But it's just too strong to fight
So tell me who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight?

See and believe
You're making me breathe deeper than the ocean
Beside us, who can we call?
We're risking what we have
For something more, don't wanna lose it all

Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
Who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight, tonight?
We've been way too cool for this.
Were these words too strong to fight?
Should we stop, should we wait before it's too late?
Should we stop, should we wait before it's too late?
Tell me who's gonna save,
Who's gonna save us tonight?
