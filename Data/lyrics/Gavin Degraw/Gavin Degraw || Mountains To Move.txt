Sunlight goes down, as you pack up your things 
Feelings amount, we can work out the kinks 
Your eyes on fire, as you drag him towards the door 
Your bags so heavy, leavin marks across the floor 

I guess, I win, Goodbye Again 
Go spread the news, Oh and don't forget your shoes 
It's going to be a long walk 
And you know what you could lose 
Oh, when you've got mountains to move 

I suppose you cant leave the mark of all your saints 
You aim too high, and I'm just trying to keep it straight 
Worse times are coming and I don't have to tell you, 
Times are already hard, 
Good luck out there getting where you think you're heading for 

I guess, I win, Goodbye Again 
Go spread the news, 
Oh and don't forget your shoes 
It's going to be a long walk 
And you know what you could lose 
Oh, when you've got mountains to move 

And oh, once I was a fool 
Who would brush all my fears aside 
There was nothing, I wouldn't do 
But now, I really seen the world on the surface 
Just, doesn't show you what it hides 

Oh, no, no 

I guess, I win, Goodbye Again 
Go spread the news, 
Oh and don't forget your shoes 
Cuz it's going to be a long walk 
And you know what you could lose 
Oh, and when you've got mountains
