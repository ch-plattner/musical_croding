
Why do the men stray 
Why do the women pray 
Why do the men fight 
Why do the women sympathize 

Whoa it was easier before I loved 
Before this heart was turned to stone 
Before this blood was stirred and blood was spilled 
No one was ever meant to be alone 

Why do the birds sing 
What do they call that thing 
Why do the bombs boom 
We're running out of living room 

Our needs getting needier and needier 
More lies are told until they're truth 
Until the messages are massacred 
Old men get all their killing done with youth 

Why do the men stray 
Why do the women pray 
Why do the men fight 
Why do the women sympathize 

All these wooden houses 
Light themselves on fire in turn 
Oh but someday there will be nothing left to burn 
Oh someday there will be nothing left to burn 

Whoa 
Whoa 
Someday someday someday someday
