
With my eyes wide open
And with words unspoken
I still understand

And I'm reading your mind
Using every outline
You're drawing in my hand

Ooo, feel your fingers
Ooo, I'm in way too deep

To wake up
Step out
Cause I'm really getting used to being in this dream
You know what I mean I
Can't find
Any reason I would ever wanna turn back now
Once you spelled it out

Oh, when I first met you
There were things I'd been through
That I would never tell

But it was almost as if
You already knew my language
Cause you'd been there yourself

Ooo, I'm still falling
Ooo, don't make me return

And wake up
Step out
Cause I'm really getting used to being in this dream
You know what I mean I
Can't find
Any reason I would ever wanna turn back now
Once you spelled it out

I know it's not an accident
I can feel it crashing in
And I'm not pushing back

Come on, we can leave the world behind
Close the curtains, shut out the light
Just state the good
Don't let me go
Don't tell me I should

Wake up
Step out
Cause I'm really getting used to being in this dream
You know what I mean I
Can't find
Any reason I would ever wanna turn back now
Once you spelled it out

Once you spelled it out
Once you spelled it out
