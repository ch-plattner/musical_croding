Well, before you go away
I'm gonna give you all that I can say
The truth is harder to amuse
But when you know it's wrong
You got to cut it loose

Oh, it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live, you don't have to look back
But if you ever do,
You know where I'm at

The thought of you to disappear
Shutting the door and walking out of here
To know there's something you must find
That I never had, believe me that I tried

Oh, it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live, you don't have to look back
But if you ever do,
You know where I'm at

Calm down
I do declare
A conversation
We tried
And put it on the line
Sometimes
The feeling can survive

Oh, it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live, you don't have to look back
But if you ever do,
You know where I'm at

Oh if you ever do,
If you ever do
You know where I'll be at
