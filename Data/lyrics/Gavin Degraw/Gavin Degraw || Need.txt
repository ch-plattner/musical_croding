
He tells lies, you slam doors
You think twice, oh oh oh oh
He makes plans, you change yours
Two damn nights, oh oh oh oh
But you got this secret you keep
Like the looks that you steal from me
Say you just don’t know, what you need
What you need

But baby when you wake up in the middle of the night
With your makeup running rivers from your eyes
You will see, what you need
Baby when you wake up cause your bed is feeling cold
And you reach out cause you want someone to hold
You will see, what you need

I’m past him, don’t fear him
Better than oh oh oh oh
So don’t waste time
Yours and mine
Girl what you need is a better man
And you got this secret you keep
Like the looks that you steal from me
Say you just don’t know what you need
What you need

But baby when you wake up in the middle of the night
With your makeup running rivers from your eyes
You will see, what you need
Baby when you wake up cause your bed is feeling cold
And you reach out cause you want someone to hold
You will see, what you need

What you need 
What you need
What you need [2x]

When you wake up in the middle of the night
With your makeup running rivers from your eyes
You will see, what you need
Baby when you wake up cause your bed is feeling cold
And you reach out cause you want someone to hold
You will see, what you need

What you need [3x]

But baby when you wake up in the middle of the night
With your makeup running rivers from your eyes
You’ll see, what you need
What you need
