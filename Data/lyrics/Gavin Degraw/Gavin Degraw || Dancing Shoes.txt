
It's so nice to see you
Can we sit and talk for a while?
I have searched forever
I can't imagine anythin' better

Kids up on the stairway
Couples on the sidewalk squares
If I get to your heart soon
I'll call a perfect afternoon

Won't you call my number?
Don't push, but don't hesitate
Wake me from this slumber
Rush me, but leave time to wake

Checkmate on my shoulder
I'm tired of this win or lose
Well, I'm no knight in shinnin' armor
But I'm no pair of dancin' shoes
I'm no pair of dancin' shoes

My patience ran away, take me with you
You keep me holdin' on
Nothin's understood, you're so confusin'
Tell it to me straight

Won't you call my number?
Don't push, but don't hesitate
Wake me from this slumber
Rush me, but leave time to wake
Rush me, but leave time to wake

I got nothin' left to lose
But I'm no pair of dancin' shoes
I got nothin' left to lose
But I'm no pair of dancin' shoes

I got nothin' left to lose
But I'm no pair of dancin' shoes
I got nothin' left to lose
But I'm no pair of dancin' shoes
