Take those boots off the shelf
Wipe that dust off yourself
Even if you’ve been through hell; you’re back
It’s time to separate the men from the boys
And the women from the girls
And the tools from the toys
Even if you’re freaking out: just relax

Hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the world’s awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

Back when it used to hurt
Took you a little while just to find the worth
Losing, well, it sometimes burns, but you keep moving on
You’ve got to push on like you’re leading the nation
Got to make the best out of this situation
Get your hands up like it’s a celebration
And you keep moving on

Singing hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the world’s awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

(oh)
Now everything will change
(oh)
Everything will change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you can’t walk the walk-walk)

Take those boots off the shelf
Wipe that dust off yourself
Even if you’ve been through hell; you’re back

Hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the world’s awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

It’ll change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you can’t walk the walk-walk)
You won't know If you don’t try
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you can’t walk the walk-walk)
It’ll change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you can’t walk the walk-walk)

Everything changes
Life happens in stages
You won't have your story
Without turning pages yeah
