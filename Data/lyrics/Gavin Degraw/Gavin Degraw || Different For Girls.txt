
Oh you just don't know, what you do to me
Oooh, I come in close 'til you can barely breathe
You're out with your friends, but it's only you
That I'm looking at, thinking baby "yes, I do"
Is it even fair?
And are we to blame?
If we're in too deep and I don't even know your name
Just another night, of another week
With a groove so hot, we don't have to speak

There's just no way, that I'm gonna hear a word you say
Cause you know that boys don't cry
While you get hung up on every other guy
And I know that it's different for girls who care
Always wonder if his head is somewhere
I know it's different for girls
That's what you are
And oh, I know I just don't understand why it's different for girls

So we have a few and a little more and a little more and a little more
Till we both let go and you just give in
Yeah, we go too weak, forget about the shape we're in
The night is young, that dress is new
You spend too much time, thinking what I mean to you
Let goooooo, we're losing control
You know

There's just no way, that I'm gonna hear a word you say
Cause you know that boys don't cry
While you get hung up on every other guy
And I know that it's different for girls who care
Always wonder if his head is somewhere
I know it's different for girls
That's what you are
And oh, I know I just don't understand why it's different for girls

I don't understand why
I'm searching and I need to know
Just take me by the hand while
To get a little love and risk it all
I'm in trouble baby, can I get a witness?
I'm in trouble and I really need some help

There's just no way that I'm gonna hear a word you say
Cause you know that boys don't cry
While you get hung up on every other guy
And I know that it's different for girls who care
Always wonder if his head is somewhere
I know it's different for girls
That's what you are
And oh, I know I just don't understand why it's different for girls

Are we headed somewhere?
And oh, I know I just don't understand why it's different for girls
Headed somewhere
Is it headed somewhere?
Tell me if we're headed somewhere
ooooohhhh
