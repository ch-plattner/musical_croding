
I was dreaming of the past,
And my heart was beating fast.
I began to loose control,
I began to loose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you,
Im sorry that I made you cry.
I didn't want to hurt you,
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure,
you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside,
I was shivering inside.
I didn't mean to hurt you,
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
I didn't want to hurt you,
no I didn't,
I'm just a jealous guy.

I'm jealous,
Jealous,
Jealous.
I'm jealous,
jealous,
jealous.
I'm jealous,
jealous,
jealous.
I'm jealous,
jealous,
I'm just a jealous guy.
