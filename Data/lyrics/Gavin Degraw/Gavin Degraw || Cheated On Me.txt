I'm love-sick somewhere tonight
I'm love-sick somewhere tonight
I don't need writing on the wall
I've felt it for so long
Am I even on your mind
Or are you now in...

[Chorus]
Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves
I'm a jealous guy
I hear people talk
And it isn't hard to believe
I think you cheated on me

I've been this love-sick before
I've felt just like this before
There was another just like you
I loved her for so long
But I had poison on my mind
And I drove her into...

[Chorus]
Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves
I'm a jealous guy
I hear people talk
And it isn't hard to believe
I think she cheated on me

[Bridge]
I said I've had this sense before
But I left an open door
For this to walk into my life
And maybe I suspect too much
But it's just hard for me to trust
When I'm all wound up inside
I just drive you off and into...

[Chorus]

Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves

I'm a jealous guy
I hear people talk
And it isn't hard to believe
I was never easy to please
And I think you cheated on me
