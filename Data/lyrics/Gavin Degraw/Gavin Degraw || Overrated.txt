
Take my home
Take everything I own
Take it, take control
You will feel better
You will feel whole
You're so good
You stopped me where I stood
And let me look at love and I feel better
Oh, I feel good 
I just want to give it all to you
I want to share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else will be over-rated
Baby, it's for you, it's all for you
You speak kind
Oh, if you were mine
What would we be like?
We would be liked
We would be... 
I just want to give it all to you
I want to share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else will be over-rated
Everything else will be over-rated
Open up
Let me fill your cup
I can really pour it out
It will be like... 
I will be enough
I just want to give it all to you
I want to share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else will be over-rated
Baby, it's for you
Baby, it's for you
Baby, it's for you
Baby, it's for you, it's all for you
