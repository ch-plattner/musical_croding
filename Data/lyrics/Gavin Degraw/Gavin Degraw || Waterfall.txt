
Say it by mine, 
Carry waves of light. 
Caught in time, 
Waitin' on the light. 

Then the winds, they go by 
Faster than fireflies. 

Hold my hand, 
Take my life. 

[Chorus:]
Waterfall, 
Waterfall, 
Waterfall, 
Waterfall, you're beautiful. 

Live by me, 
Stand next to me. 

Your lovely, 
Let nobody else see. 
And the tide is callin' 
Shadows slowly fallin'. 

Waterfall, lovin me. 

[Chorus]

All the terrible things I used to say, 
I'd like to throw them all away. 
Tell me your story 
All about the sin, 
I want to get to know you again. 

[Chorus]

Beautiful, you're beautiful, beautiful...[repeated]

Waterfall... 

You're beautiful. 

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful....[repeated 3x]
