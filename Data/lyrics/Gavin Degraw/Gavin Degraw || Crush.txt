
When my pass came in, you dropped the ball
It didn't change the way I feel
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
The kiss will know if the lips stay still
There is a line I crossed
And when you missed I lost
I'm not a loser
Girl, you know that I'll be back again
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh, my crush,I've got a crush
I suppose that I could hold it in
But you excite my every cell
Sources say that sense are your friends
My senses say that I should tell
You that I"m not ashamed
You might just feel the same
But have to try it
If you're ever really going to know
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh, my crush, I've got a crush
I want to
I need to
I have to have you
You're so much to touch
Girl, you're too much
And I can't control it - You've got me all over the road
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh, my crush
Damaging my soul
You blew me off, but I don't mind
i just get better with time
And so do you
So do you
My crush
