I'm a poor, I'm a rich 
I'm a mountain, and a ditch 
I'm a dagger, and a shield 
I'm impatient, I'm a yield 

And I wanna be free 
Wind in my hair 
Salt on my skin 
Sun in the air 
I have to feel love 
Holding on me 
I'll give you everything that you would ever need 

I'm the fight and the dance 
I am heartbreak and romance 
The feather and the stone 
I feel crowded and alone 

And I wanna be free 
Wind in my hair 
Salt on my skin 
Sun in the air 
I have to feel love 
Holding on me 
I'll give you everything that you would ever need 

And every once in a while 
I wanna sit back and enjoy the view 
I'm feeling my senses 
But woman my life has been surrounded by fences 
But I found some that I could see through 
I could see through 

And I wanna be free 
Wind in my hair 
Salt on my skin 
Sun in the air 
I have to feel love 
Holding on me 
I'll give you everything that you would ever need 

Everything that you would ever need 
Everything that you would ever need
