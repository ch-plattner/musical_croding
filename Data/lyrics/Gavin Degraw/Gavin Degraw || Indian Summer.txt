
Summer is lost now 
The frost is closing in 
To the cold gospel dollar 
The poor man walks in sin 
I can't get no entrance 
The doors all in rows 
I pray into the distance 
Let me outta these heavy clothes 

I beg 
Indian summer I need some return 
So hard to get warm now 
And so easy to get burned 
Down on the pavement the laws are learned 
It's so hard to get warm where 
It's so easy to get burned 

When a sister called up 
And said that love had broken down 
I said there too much ice around here 
To find no solid ground 
Well I just squeezed a season 
From this paper bag 
I pray to the burning tires 
Wrap my feet in rags 

Begging 
Indian summer I need some return 
It's so hard to get warm now 
And so easy to get burned 
Down on the pavement the laws are learned 
It's so hard to get warm where 
It's so easy to get burned 

Now the sky is empty 
The street is sweating tears 
Communion at the station 
For a million grinding gears 
Well I'm riding out this century 
The harvest engines sing 
From the church of mercenaries 
To a naked virgin spring 

I'm singing 
Indian summer I need some return 
It's so hard to get warm now 
And so easy to get burned 
Down on the pavement the laws are learned 
It's so hard to get warm where 
It's so easy to get burned 

Hard to get warm where 
It's so easy to get burned
