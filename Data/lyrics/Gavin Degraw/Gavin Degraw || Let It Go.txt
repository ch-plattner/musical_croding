
I can't live without you
Set my goals around you
Takes a little extra time
But it all works out

You're a shining ember
I'll be shining armor
Just look up into my eyes
I won't let you down

And I'll always be here
Yes, I'll always be here

[Chorus]
Let it go
Settle into me
Let it go
Let it all go

Except for me
I'm the one you found
Just hold on
Hold onto me now

Why don't we play hooky?
We could both get lucky
Better to get lucky than to go to work today

We don't have to shower
You won't wait in traffic
Take our daily panic and we'll put it all away

And we'll always be near
We should always be near

[Chorus]

Don't you know you're the one for me
After all, anyone can see
