Got a text from you
Is it really true?
All the stuff we did last night
We shut down the bars
Danced on top of cars
Asked some girl if she’d be my wife

Oh, and I got pictures that I don’t remember taking that are so bad
And, oh, I had to break into my own damn apartment
How bout that?

They say the best always come from the worst nights baby, but
 Oh, it was crazy
And, oh, it was amazing
We blew all our money 
And crashed in your Mercedes
Yeah, we both got numbers
But didn’t get the names
And my whole damn party lost power
It was, it was, it was our finest hour

Bruises on my knee
They’re all over me
Think I mighta lost a fight
Found a drink receipt
From 42nd street
Man, we musta lost our minds
I got pictures that I don’t remember taking that are so bad
I think I mighta fell asleep in the subway
How bout that?

They say the best always come from the worst nights baby, but
 Oh, it was crazy
And, oh, it was amazing
We blew all our money 
And crashed in your Mercedes
Yeah, we both got numbers
But didn’t get the names
And my whole damn party lost power
It was, it was, it was our finest hour

This night was ours
This night was ours
And it was our finest hour

This night was ours
This night was ours
And it was our finest hour

Got a text from you

All the stuff we did last night

Oh, it was crazy
And, oh, it was amazing
We blew all our money 
And crashed in your Mercedes
Yeah, we both got numbers
But didn’t get the names
And my whole damn party lost power
It was, it was, it was our finest hour, our finest hour
It was our finest hour
This night was ours
This night was ours 
And it was our finest hour
