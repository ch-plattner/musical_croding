Na na na nana na na nah
Na na na nana na na nah

I'll lay it down one time through, gather round
Though this is a chore
So rich with lies, I prefer poor advice
And showed her the door

This is your goodbye and kiss opportunity
Thought you were burning me down
But I'm finally free and...

If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again
I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Oh the sun came up
Tell me where'd I park?
We did it again.
We had some fun
Did some things
We got dumb
But I want it to end

Cause I only give in
When I get the need
I'm only coming around
Cause I get to leave and...

If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again
I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Can't breathe, I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout the best of you and,
Some things I couldn't see
What about the rest of you?
Well, you're under my skin
But I can't let you win
Though you don't see scars
That's exactly what they are baby
Na na nana na nah
Na na nana na nah
Ooooh oh
Baby, baby, baby
You're never gonna hurt me

If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again
I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation
[x2]

Na na nana na nah
Yes I am
Na na nana na nah
I gotta get out
Na na nana na nah
Na na nana na nah
If you miss me
If you miss me, if you miss me
Na na nana na nah
Na na nana na nah...
