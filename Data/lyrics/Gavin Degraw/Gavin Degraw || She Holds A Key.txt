
This ain't the kind of affair to make you dance about
But there's something to say for the things
You wouldn't regularly let out
At least this chase makes you feel new

[Chorus]
She holds a key
Tight in her hand
Clutching his neck
She is breaking the man
Listen you sinner
I'm sinning too
Just wait until the darkness falls
So I can sin with you

You've run through the whole gamut of gameplay
The head-trip parade
Without any experience
You've become curious prey
So change your position
This decision you're making
Is digging a hole
Oh, and where you're headed
Only heaven knows

[Chorus]

So set out your plans
Break down your walls
Count what you're blessed with
You've counted them all
There's something to save
But you have to search
You might not believe
But, believe me, it works,
Believe me it works, yes it does

[Chorus]
She holds a key
Tight in her hand
Clutching his neck
She is breaking the man
Listen you sinner
I'm sinning too
Just wait until the darkness falls
So I can sin with you
