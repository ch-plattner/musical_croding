I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you

If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you from the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you

And If I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you

I said if I had one wish I'd know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
