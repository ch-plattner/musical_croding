[Verse 1]
You girl this little game you play
It don’t stop till you go too far
So what’s a man like me to say
With a bullet laying in my heart, damn, love
We go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that’s the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

[Verse 2]
Now what's that, baby? What you say?
'Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til it ain’t no more

Damn, love, how did the sound get so amped up?.
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit insane or insane love?
Guess that's the way that we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

You should see the look on your face
Baby when I finish what you start
But I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands, love?
Laid you to rest, you said, damn love
This shit's insane, it's insane love
Ain’t that the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold

Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away

Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away

She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
What am I gonna do with all this?..
Only when I walk away

(hold up, hold up)

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone and tell me, "Baby do you stay?"
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
I said, "Fuck you bitch we don't care what you say."
