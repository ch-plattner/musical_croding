Now baby the day you were born
They picked you up and wrapped you, you up
So cold but so hot everything melts on you
It's cool you ain't got on nothing baby
Cause I know what to do, girl, let's coordinate, yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
First I take you out, then you turn around baby
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we're at our own place
So I take you home, wear wherever you want, baby
Cause I know that we're gonna end up back where we started

[Chorus:]
And you don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh baby
Tell me what's better than the two us
Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don't think she heard me so I say
Oooh, baby you got it... on
I said ooh, baby you got it... on

Now everything you put on
Everything you put on looks better on you, than the one you tried on before
Don't make me pick girl, don't make me choose
Don't you feel like you're back in the twelfth grade
Now you're my first lady so let's take it back to our first date
This is what we do...

First I take you out, then you turn around baby
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we're at our own place
So I take you home, wear wherever you want, baby
Cause I know that we're gonna end up back where we started

And all I'm saying is you don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on oh baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don't think she heard me so I say
Oooh, baby you got it... on
I said ooh, baby you got it... on

[Bridge:]
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you, oh baby

You don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Baby you got it on
Tell me what's better than the two of us
Nothing baby you got it
I don't think she heard me so I say
I say ooh, baby you've got it on
I'm telling you mama
Ooh baby you've got it on

Don't matter what you wear
Baby you've got it on
And it sounds like falling in love

Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Yeah baby you got it on
