I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it

Don't know why but girl
I'm feeling close to you, maybe it's this ocean view
I'm so emotional, and all these stars been dancing on my head
Too long, too long, too long
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you, the words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong

It might seem like I'm catching something. That's because it's true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it but I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful 'cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it and I stand by it, and I won't hide it anymore

A crowded room anywhere, a million people around, all I see is you there
Everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenses only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear

I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision, I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision, I only see you

Now that I know the truth, what am I supposed to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like a movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra, and the background just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

It might seem like I'm catching something. That's because it's true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it but I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful 'cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it and I stand by it, and I won't hide it anymore

A crowded room anywhere, a million people around, all I see is you there
Everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenses only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear

I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision, I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision, I only see you

Zoom zoom zoom....

I only see you, yeah!
Zoom zoom zoom....
Zoom zoom zoom, in on you, in on you.
I only see you, yeah!

I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it

A crowded room anywhere, a million people around, all I see is you there
Everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenses only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear
