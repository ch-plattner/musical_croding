She aint that chick from the burbs thats a stranger to drama 
She that uptown girl wit the cocky personna 
When out my way to let her know that I want her
I told her I know for sure we belong together 
and I wouldnt break her heart my intentions are better 
And I shared the same dreams she had about chedda
When the D's came she was down to hold the BARETTA 
I got a thing for baby girl 
It's me and her against the world

You were my sun, you were my earth
but you didnt know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, made other plans
But I betcha didnt think that they would come crashin down, no

You don't have to say, What cha did
I already know, I found out from HIM
now theres just no chance
with you and me
there will never be
don't it make you sad about it

you told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

Girl I refuse

Your smile make my day it's simple, your dimple 
Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized 
Communication is deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk 
You make a nigga forget about a life full of DRAMA
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma 
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL 
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider 
I'm in heaven when I am inside her 
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck 
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct 
Have her drippin wet
She look in my eye and said she like but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nothing of it
