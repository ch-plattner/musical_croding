
Dum dum dum dum dum-dum
Do...
Do... Oooh...

You're still captivating even though it's been so long
You used to love me tell me baby what went wrong
'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song

Try to understand that we needed space
But everywhere I turn I see your face
I've been waiting for you to come home
'Cause I don't want to be alone
I still love you

Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
You are my light

I have changed girl since I last saw you
When you left you don't know what you put me through
But my heart's still racing just being next to you

I can't escape the magic in your eyes
Is there a way to make you realize
There's no one more special to my heart
But you want us to be apart
I still love you

Why did you take away your love, baby
When did you think to just give up, yea
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you

You were my world
You meant everything to me
You're the air I breathe
The song I sing
You were my queen, I was your king
But if we can try to work it
We'll show the world what love is about
Baby come on cause I can't take no more
Of this loneliness
And emptiness

Why did you take away your love
(Take away your love)
When did you think to just give up
(Oh...)
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you

Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on
Without you
You are my
You are my light
