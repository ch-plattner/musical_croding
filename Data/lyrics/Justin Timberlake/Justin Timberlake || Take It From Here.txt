Sometimes, sometimes the world gets hard

Oh na na na
I'm gonna take it from there girl
Don't you worry

I wanna be your lake or your bay
And any problems that you have
I wanna wash 'em away
I wanna be your sky
So blue and high
And everytime you think of me
I wanna blow your mind

I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there

I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here

I wanna hold your hands
Review all your plans
I wanna make sure everyone of your dreams will stand
I wanna be your broadway show on review
(Why)
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shining path to help you across
I wanna be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
Cause I love you

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
(Take it from here, baby)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm gonna take it from here

And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
That's what I'm gonna do
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
(Don't you worry, baby girl, baby girl)
Don't worry, girl
(Baby girl)
I'm gonna take it from here
(I'll take you whereever you want)

Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm gonna take it from here

Give me one reason
Why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving
The time is now
Lets fly away speeding
(We'll fly away)
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet and breathing
Of love surrounds
(Lets get away)

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
(I got somethin' I wanna tell ya baby)

Love ain't always the way they write in books
(No, no)
See there's the good guys
And also heartbreak crooks
Your hearts the real book
Just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide

So there you go
Don't worry
I'll be the one
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here
