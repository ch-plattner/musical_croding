
I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

In your eyes a see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby
Pharrell say don't do it the same
But I say ain't playing my games
But for you my soul still remains
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

I hope you're thinking
(Remember girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

Last night
(Just-a last night)
Can't believe what I was hearing
(Just can't believe it baby)
Telling me to have a nice life
(Oh)
So tonight
(Yea)
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right
(Got something I wanna tell ya girl)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you
(Let me tell you one more time)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
(My baby)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
(Yea yea yea yea)
Well I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you

Oh baby
Yea yea yea yea
See I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you

Remember girl when I was your man
Ain't nothing gonna take that away
No no no no, no no-no

See I remember
In December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby?
