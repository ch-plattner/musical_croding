
I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
Don't you love it too?

Yo
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time
You know this ain't a pick up line
I just think that you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

Well I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down
Been working hard all week
Just trying to make your money
Girl go on and shake your booty
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

By the way what's your sign
I bet it is compatible with mine
Probably long lasting years down the line
I'm telling you girl you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
(Just let go)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

Oh...
(Remember)
Oh...
(The first time we met)
Oh...
(Butterflies in your stomach)
Oh...
(Couldn't speak)
Oh...
(You)
Oh...
(Close your eyes)
Oh...
(It's ok)
Oh...
(I was lovin' it)
Oh...

How, how you do all the things you do?
(How you do it?)
Like being you, you're so professional
(Professional)
Not to mention you're the baddest of your group
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down
(Wanna get down)
Been working hard all week
(Oh, yea)
Just trying to make your money
(Money)
Girl go on and shake your booty
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

I'm lovin' it
(Hey..)
I'm lovin' it
(Hey..)
I'm lovin' it
(Oh...)
Don't you love it too?
