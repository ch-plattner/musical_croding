
Sometimes I can't believe what I am seeing
But I always recive the love that you giving to me
And I still don't know what lead me to you
But I know this, this was meant to be
And girl in your smile I see my everything

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth

Tu tu tu tu...

Sometimes I can't believe the things I say to you
But baby every word of it's true, yes it is
And when you kiss me, it's all over
You put me under, I didn't know that love could hurt so good
And girl when you smile I see my everything

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth

[Bridge x2:]
Girl when I see you smile, you make my day worthwhile
Girl when you speak to me I can't feel myself breathe

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth
