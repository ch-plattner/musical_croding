[Intro: Timbaland]
In all, enthrilling new, living sound
Kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, lights out, TKO
Boo

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, everyday you're training to get the gold
That's why your body's crazy
But you can't run from yourself, that's where it's difficult

Girl I can see in your eyes that there's
Something inside that made you evil
Where did you go?
'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore
TKO

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO, T-T-TKO
Out for the count, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I don't really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody's heart is swollen
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside
That made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore
TKO

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO, T-T-TKO
Out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl?
You, you, you knock me right out
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you knock me right out
Hey, girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you knock me right out
See what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you knock me right out

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore
TKO
TKO

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
TKO
You've been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe

(Dammit babe) Dammit babe

So, I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
With a TKO
With a TKO
With a TKO
