Hey little mama
Ain’t gotta ask me if I want to
Just tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins

'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I’m on you
I don’t wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin’ you

Now you got me hopped upon that pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So gon' and be my dealer baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby

One more time

Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer baby
Hook me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby, yeah, yeah.

You’re my little pusher love girl
Ain’t ya? Ooh, ooh, yeah.
Just my little pusher love girl

Now hey little mama
I love this high we're on too
And I know that your supply
Won’t run out anytime soon

You gave me a taste, now I know that there’s no getting off you
I don’t wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin’ you

So high I’m on the ceiling baby

Since you came around
I’ve been living a different life.
And I don’t wanna come down
From this love I got on high.
People call me a user, but I want you
To go on and use me too.
Nothing else will do.
All I want is you, baby.

Sing pusher love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
C'mon
Now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it
Pusher love
And now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Break it down

My heroine, my cocaine
My plum wine
My MDMA, I'm hopped upon it
It won't go away
And I can't wait 'til I get home to get you in my veins

Pusher love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it
And now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Say pusher love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it
And now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love

My nicotine, my blue dream
My hydroponic, candy jelly bean
Can't you fix me up?
I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream

Blood shot eyes, I'm hopped upon it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop upon it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
That's pusher love, that's what I call it

Pusher love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it
Now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love

Let me hear you say pusher love

Now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it, yeah
And now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love

Pusher love
Pusher love
Pusher love
