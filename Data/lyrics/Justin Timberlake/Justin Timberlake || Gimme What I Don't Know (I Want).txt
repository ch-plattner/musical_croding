The sounds are calm when we become the animals that were made in the jungle...

Why you standin' so far away?
Mindin' manners and lookin' on, by
Why don't you come out and play
And get closer to your animal, inside
Maybe I act like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Show me your teeth and then spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you're wild as a stray
Side show in front of the whole, crowd

Maybe I act like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Sounds are calm when we become the animals that were made in the jungle...
(Give it to me now)

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

The sounds are calm...
(Give it to me now)
The sounds are calm...
(Give it to me now)

Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
