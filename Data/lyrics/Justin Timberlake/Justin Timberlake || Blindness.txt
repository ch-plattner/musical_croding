Stuck in black and white
You're in technical brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

I close my eyes cause you've been gone
Such a long time, I fantasize
You close so long fantasy
Began to see, it altered my mind
Am I crazy
When I open my eyes
The world was gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can't I see you
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technical brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

If I close my eyes and concentrate
You illuminate your brightest slide
And I let you go the worst mistake
It's clear as day
But I can't wrap my mind around it baby
And when I open my eyes
The world is gone, long gone, long gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can't I see you
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technical brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

Tell me why can't I see you
It's like I'm stuck in black and white
And you're in technical brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

Why can't I see you
In black and white
You're in technical brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness
