[4x]
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

[Verse 1]
Red was the color of her eyes
When she put me in a meditation states
Her skin was white, so white
Look like it had no expiration dates
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

[Bridge:]
Aw, give it to me now (so evil in the dress)
It circulates, you start to feel it (devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to invoke the spirits (got you on the floor)
She comes alive when you're the killing (hungry for some more)

[Hook:]
Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's the demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
[2x]
(It makes me say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type she told me that she found her perfect blood mate

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Rose me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna freak
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle (candle...)
Sometimes it feels like...
Smells so funky.
Guitar

Give it to me
Break
Smells so good

[Hook]

[4x]
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

Give it to me

[4x]
Start to think like an animal

Now that you got me
Tell me what you’re gonna do with me
I taste your blood
And found out you was the perfect fit
Come on
Show me what you’re working with
Come on mama
Go and show me what you’re working with
Show me what you’re working with

True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…

Now that you got me
Tell me what you’re gonna do with me
‘Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you were my perfect fit
Come on mama
Show me what you’re working with
I said come on mama
Come on, show me what you’re working with

You got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)
You got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)

[3x]
You got that (true blood)
She hit me with the (true blood)
You got that (true blood)
She hit me with the (true blood)

[2x]
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
