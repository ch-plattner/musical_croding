[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Walking around middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'mma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Chocha ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck

[Hook]
