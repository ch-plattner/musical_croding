[Verse 1:]
(Yeah, uh)
Keeps coming closer, I don't, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type, amnesia, that's over (uh)
I can see you breathing, girl, it's colder
I can see you need me but I don't care
My whole memory of me in love, gone so far from me, girl
It's not fair
I could feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much, that's when it starts to fade

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone.
But if it was true, if it was you
Don't you think, don't you think I would know?
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2:]
Now these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened?
Who were they? Where did they go?
When was enough, enough?
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love's gone so far from me, it's not fair
And I can feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But it just hurts too much, I've let it go away

(Oh, no)

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone.
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?, don't you think I would know?
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: went from everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know

(Hey)
(Ooh, ah)

I could feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much, I let it go away

(Ooohh)

[Bridge:]
So cold baby (so cold), now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone (yeah).
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?, don't you think I would know?

I got amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia (amnesia): everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore she's a stranger that I used to know
And I don't know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
She's a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

(Hey, ooha oohaa oohaa)

Go on and, tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot, who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fuckin amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fuckin amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
I'll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn't this love insane, insane? Yeah...
