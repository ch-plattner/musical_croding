Hi, how ya'll feeling tonight?
Thank ya'll for coming out to the wise underground club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
Show him some southern love
JT and the Tennessee Kids
Come on! Give it up!

[Justin:]
Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids
One, two, three
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
I think I'm in love with you

[Verse 1]
Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, been running through my mind all day baby
'They all say I'm crazy, cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear what they say

[Hook]
'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me

So what you're from the other side of the tracks,
so what the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 2]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us like when you fell from heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't even care nothing about it, babe
'Cause since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same.

[Hook]
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me

So what you're from the other side of the tracks,
so what the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Break]
My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here and let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

[Bridge]
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

I told you I'm in love with that girl

[Hook]
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, oh, no, no
So don't be mad at me
I don't care

So what you're from the other side of the tracks?
so what the world don't think we match?
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Outro]
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
'Cause I'm in love with that girl
