This goes out to you
I know I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
This is dedicated to you...

This goes out to you
This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you.....
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you

Pretty lady
When you walk by...

It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day

I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
And then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery,
I don't know why I let you kick in my "Do not disturb" sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before,
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original

And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum

Go ahead girl
This goes out to you,
Yeah, this goes out to you,
You know what time
I'll give it to you

So tell me why
We're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting all professional but it works out
'Cause you don't wanna work here anyway
And baby I, I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before,
And baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original

And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum,
Hey, hey, hey, my little, hey, hey, hey

Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite.
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own.
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips.
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah

If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I'll love you 'til I make it pop.

If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(little girl would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop

Hey, hey, hey.

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum

If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(little girl would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum,
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
