If you missed the train I'm on 
You will know that I am gone 
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

A hundred miles, a hundred miles, 
A hundred miles, a hundred miles 
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two,
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home,
Away from home, away from home
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Instrumental]

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go back home this ole way

This ole way, this ole way,
This ole way, this ole way,
Lord, I can't go back home this this ole way

If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
