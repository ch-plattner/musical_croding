
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ohhh, Yeah, Yeah

Girl I find you so amazing
With everyday I learn more about you
The way you work day out and day in
And still find time for us too, yeah

I love the fact that you’re there for me when I feel down
No matter what I’m going through
Lately I’ve been questioning myself
Am I good enough for you?

[CHORUS:]
Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love
You’ve got me questioning (yeah)
Got me wondering (yeah, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

I know that there’ll be times when I’ll be miles away
And you’ll be all alone
I constantly fight my insecurities
When I can’t reach you by phone

And, oh, Lord knows that I’m only human
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions
I know that you truly love me but
Fear has me second-guessing

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love
You’ve got me questioning
Got me wondering 
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

Girl excuse my ways (excuse my ways)
I’m not trying to push your love away (your love away)
It’s just that sometimes my imagination gets the best of me, yeah
I still love you baby everyday, yeah yeah

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love (to maintain this love)
You’ve got me questioning 
Got me wondering (you got me thinking about myself)
Could I be that man (am I good enough for you)
That can keep you happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough? (strong enough, yeah)
To maintain this love (to maintain this love)
You’ve got me questioning 
Got me wondering (you got me wondering, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I wanna keep you happy
