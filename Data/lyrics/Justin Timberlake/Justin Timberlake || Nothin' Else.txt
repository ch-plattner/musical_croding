
I was just walking that day
Aimlessly
(Oh, oh no)
You picked a perfect day
To bump into me
(Perfect day, mmm)
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky 
The night before
(Heey, hey)
But for some reason
We still met at your store
(You, baby)
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life
And I listen well
(Hey)
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings 
(Ohhh ooo ohh)


There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
To me

All my friends meet you and say
You're the one
(You're the one, you're the one... hey ooo)
And all my meaningless friendships Should be done
(I should just leave them alone, baby, eh heh)
You had a friend
But he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign
That reads
Please move on
With me
(With me)

You taught me to use my heart 
And forget my eyes
(Use my heart... forget my eyes.. mmm)
And that's the way 
To His kingdom of eternal life
(ooh eh heh hehhh)
Since you're an angel, baby
Your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you
When they dial 9-1-1
(That's why..)

There's nothin' else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
(To me, to me, to me)
To me

There's nothin' else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
(To me, to me, to me)
To me

There's nothin' else in this world
(Nothin' else)
Like you
(Yeah)
So why is it so complicated?
(So complicated)
What are you afraid of?

(Oooh, ooh)
I've been asking everybody 
What they think
(Yeah, yeah)
But I don't know why
Because they don't know you
(Oooh, ooh)
I'm even asking other guys
What would they say
(Yeah, yeah)
But I don't know why
'Cause they don't do what I do
(Oooh, ooh)
Girl, I say an ultimatums for you
(Yeah-yeah, yeah)
But you'd probably take that
And just run
(Oooh, ooh)
Now I gotta decide if I'mma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatums or me 
That's no fun

I was just walking that day 
Aimlessly

Da da da-dum
Da da da-dum
Da da da-dum
Dum dum dum...
