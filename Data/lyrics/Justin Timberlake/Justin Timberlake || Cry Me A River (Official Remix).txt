Yeah.. y'supposed to have a remix.  that's how you make one hit record into two.. hahaha(50 cent). G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!

I remember when you used to love me, you used to kiss and hug me, I looked into your eyes and get lost for a day.  You love me's what you told me, all that
time I let you hold me, how I ain't feel you slippin' away..

[Justin Timberlake]
You were my sun(Whoo!)
You were my earth(Uh huh!)
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!)
So you took a chance
And made other plans(Yeah!)
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no(Come on!)

You don't have to say, what you did,
I already know(Hahaha..), I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone(Uh huh, Uh huh)
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy(Yeah!)
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er, yea yea(Ooooooow!)

I know that they say
That somethings are better left unsaid(Uh huh!)
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it, yeah)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
(Yea..)

You don't have to say, what you did,
(Don't have to say, what you did)
I already know(haha!), I found out from him
(I already know, uh)
Now there's just no chance, (the chorus now..)for you and me, there'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
(All alone)(50 Cent!)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
(When you call me on the phone)
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
(I'm not like them baby)
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
(It's your turn)
To cry, cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river-er
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

50 Cent!  If you know what I know you know, you aint gotta say a word,
whats done in the dark comes to light,  I'm feelin', kick it to the curb.
You smile all up in my face, girl you gotta' lot of nerve. Situation's  so  absurd.
You  ain't special.   You's a  bird.
Get your sh*t and hit the door, you ain't welcomed here no  more.
Ain't  no  sense  in seein' you cryin', girl you know I know you're lyin'.
You must take me for a fool, thinkin' I'm'a stay wit' you..
First gimme' back my jewels, bitch I ain't playin' wit' you..
