[2x]
What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

[Verse 1]
Oh my, you're skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said that I want you to ignite fires all night
And you got the power
You’re damn right
It's life or death
Not gonna make it if you don’t connect tonight right

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night,
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something
That’s just how electricity behaves
Now we're needing it so bad,
The other ones don’t last

Wait a minute I’m feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark,
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

[Hook:]
Love won’t die, running low but girl your love won't die,
So what you’re giving me girl
All that energy give it here
You know how it goes sometimes,
Love won’t die, running low but girl,
Your love won’t die,
But if you need any girl
I got energy come and get it,
Know how it goes sometimes
Sometimes I need a little(more)
Give a little, if I get a little
We could meet any place
About the middle tonight,
And you got the power,
Baby you know, if you're ever low
I will go low and bring you back into the light.

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something(yeah)
That’s just how electricity behaves
And I’ve been needing it so bad
The other ones don’t last

Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I should’ve known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

What's your suggestion for tonight?

Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,

You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady
