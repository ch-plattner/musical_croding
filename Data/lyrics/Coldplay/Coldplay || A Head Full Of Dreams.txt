Oh, I think I've landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

And say it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
It's a love, Iâ€™ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

I sing, oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you've got me open handed
Now you got me lost for words

I sing, oh

A head full of dreams

It's a love, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

With a head, with a head
Full of dreams
