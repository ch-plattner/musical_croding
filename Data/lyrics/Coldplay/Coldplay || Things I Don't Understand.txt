How tides control the sea 
And what becomes of me 
How little things can slip out of your hand 

How often people change 
No two remain the same 
Why things don't always turn out as you planned 

These are things that I don't understand 
Yeah these are things that I don't understand 

I can't (and I can't) 
Decide 
Wrong (oh my wrong) 
From right 
Day (oh my day) 
From night 
Dark (oh my dark) 
From light 
I love (but I love) 
This life 

How infinite is space 
And who decides your fate 
Why everything will dissolve into sand 

How to avoid defeat 
Where truth and fiction meet 
Why nothing ever turns out as you planned 

These are things that I don't understand 
Yeah these are things that I don't understand 

I can't (and I can't) 
Decide 
Wrong (oh my wrong) 
From right 
Day (oh my day) 
From night 
Dark (oh my dark) 
From light 
I love (but I love) 
This life.
