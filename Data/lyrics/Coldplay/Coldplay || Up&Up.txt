Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, Up and up

Down upon a canvas, working with a wheel
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange peel
Up and up, Up and up

See a performer, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, Up and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Drowning in the study emptying the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, Up and up

How can people suffer? How can people part?
How can people struggle? How can people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna know, show me how to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

I’m trying to see the forest staring at every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Cause you can say what is, power through it
Close your mind and clench your fist
You can change minds, take the risk
Or see each soul like happiness

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flow

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up

Don't ever give up
Just believe in love
