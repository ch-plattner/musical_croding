All that we fall for
Homes places we've grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world (yeah we do yeah we do)
We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fall for
homes places we've grown 
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world (yeah we do yeah we do)
We live in a beautiful world [X2]

Oh all that I know is nothing to run from
Cause yeah everybody here got's somebody to lean on
