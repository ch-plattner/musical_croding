Poor me, I'm floating out to sea 
An opportunity that went by 
Poor you, oh what you gonna do 
No what you gonna do, you just cry 

Oh, you always come undone 
Try into the sun, you don't know why 
Poor you, I know what you gonna do 
Come on love I'll see it through, I don't know why 

I hear you come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

Poor me, now float me out to sea 
Oh no just let it be, come on try 
Poor you, oh what you gonna do 
Oh what you gonna do, you just cry 

I hear you come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

I don't understand 
I don't understand 

Oooh, ahhhh, ahhhh
