
If sweet death should ever come for me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
Let me go, boys, let me go

One day death is gonna conquer me
I'll be down where the water flows
I hope sweet heaven is the place for me
Let me know, boys, let me know

If sweet death should ever come for me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free
Let me go boys, let me go

If you hear him comin', won't you say for me
That I just don't want to go
