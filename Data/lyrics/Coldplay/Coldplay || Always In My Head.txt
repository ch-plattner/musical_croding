
I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do
But, I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led

And so my mouth waters, to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my...
Always in my...

This, I guess, is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest...
