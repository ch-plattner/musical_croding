[Verse 1 - Cat Power:]
It's been a night
Such a night
Such a long night
Watch myself disappear
Into the wild side
Said good bye to hard side
Sang, saw a jackal appear

[Chorus:]
Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

[Verse 2 - Cat Power (Cat Power and Coldplay):]
In a fight, such a fight
You love our fight
I'm not lying, this I swear
(The demons that hide inside
To the wild, why am I tired
How come I'm never there)

[Chorus:]
Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

[Outro - Cat Power:]
And I, I wish I was here
And I, I wish I was here
