
I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know

All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I thrown

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side

And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know

Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure

And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
