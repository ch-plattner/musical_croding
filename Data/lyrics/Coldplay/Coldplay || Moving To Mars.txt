
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown,
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see
7 6 5 4 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars,
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars
