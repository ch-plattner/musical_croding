I hope we can find a way 
Seeing it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of letting you see 
That I'm so easy to please 
So easy 

Love, I hope we grow up 
I hope we can find a way 
Of seeing it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of letting you see 
That I'm so easy to please 
So easy
