
You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong. You might.

The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love,
But you never looked hard enough,
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry,
Nothing is as down or as up as us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

All you ever wanted was love,
But you never looked hard enough,
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be,
Living in perfect symmetry,
Nothing is as down or as up

Don't you want to see it come soon,
Floating in a big white balloon
Come give her your own silver spoon

Don't you want to see it come down?
There for throwing your arms around
And say "You're not a moment too soon."

Cause I feel low, cause I feel low
ooooh...
Yeah I feel low
oh no...oooh
Cause I feel low, cause I feel low
oh...
Yet I feel low
oh no...oooh
