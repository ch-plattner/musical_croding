
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft

Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below.

So if you love me, why d'you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Said if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?
