
Oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh

So we left La Mancha
Heading out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza

Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reigns
'Till the windmills answer

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said he's not too clever

When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Gonna make one better, yeah!

So tell that princess
Tell that princess "hide down the drain"
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Oooh
Oooh
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Where the people sing
"Ole ole ole ole
Ole ole..."
([The People:] Ole ole ole ole, Coldplay Coldplay...)
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain
