Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the rhymes
He asked Will I see heaven in mine?

That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh they say you could see your future,
Inside a glass of water
With riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh Oh Oh

Ah Son, dont ask,
Neither how full nor empty
is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on the wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions said and past
In figurines and leaders
saying nothing at all
And he chimed stars in heaven aligned
Oh Oh Oh

Ah Son, dont ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

[instrumental]

What are we drinking when were done?
Glasses of water...
