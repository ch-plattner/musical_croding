When it started we had high hopes 
Now my back's on the line 
My back's on the ropes 

When it started we were alright 
But night makes a fool 
of us in the daylight 

Then we were dying of frustration 
Saying Lord lead me not into temptation 
But it’s not easy when she turns you on 
Sin, stay gone 

If you’d only, if you’d only say yes 
Whether you will's anybody’s guess 
God only God knows I'm trying my best 
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness 

Hey 

So up they picked me by the big toe 
I was held from the rooftop then they let go 
Dizzily screaming 'Let the windows down' 
As I crawl to the ground 

If you'd only if you'd only say yes 
Whether you will's anybody's guess 
God only God knows she won't let me rest 
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness 
I've become so tired of this loneliness
