
They put the world in a tin can black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat two hands around the throat
Oh, you want to get it right sometimes

There's so much to be scared of and not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control? If your hear can you let me know
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you just want to get it right sometimes
You just want to get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up, ooh

And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped
Oh, we just want to get it right sometimes
We just want to get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you, ooh, ooh, oh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world
