
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like
Something's missing
Things you never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swim out on a sea of faces
The tide of the human races
An answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rise and
See it break on your horizon
Oh come on love
Stay with me
