And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on baby, don’t let it break your heart

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball.
And a slowly burning tide (oh)
Through my veins is flowing.
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she sang

When you're tired of aiming your arrows,
Still you never hit the mark
And even if your aims are shadows
Still we're never gonna part

Come on baby don't let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don’t let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don’t let it break your heart

Don’t let it break your heart’
