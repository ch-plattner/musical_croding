To my surprise, and my daylight
I saw sun rise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing, in the dark
And the clouds burst to show a daylight 
Oooooo and the sun shines, Yeaaahhh on this star of mine
Oooooo and I realise, Oooooo couldn't live without
Oooooo couldn't part without, it

On a hill top, on a sky rise
Like a first born, child
At a full tilt, and at full flight
You see darkness, in the daylight

Oooooo and the sun shines, Yeaaahhh on this star of mine
Oooooo and I realise, Oooooo couldn't be without
Oooooo couldn't part without, daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight [x22 to fade]
