
Murder coming to get us
Yeah coming to get us and away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide

Murder coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And away we hide
Away we hide

Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head 
Sing a song to me 
Sing a song like what you said 

And they're gonna murder me 
They're gonna take me down 
Even before I sleep
I cry murder

Come spit at us 
Come and throw your weight around 
Come and fight with us 
Try and knock us to the ground 

'Cause they're gonna murder me 
They're gonna take me down 
Even before I sleep
I scream murder
Murder

Oh now what can it possibly gain? 
Oh what can it possibly gain? 
Oh now what can it possibly gain?
Oh yeah what can it possibly gain?

Cry murder, murder
I cry murder

Murder I'm coming to get us
I'm coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
It's coming to get us 
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around you
See it all around you
And away we hide
