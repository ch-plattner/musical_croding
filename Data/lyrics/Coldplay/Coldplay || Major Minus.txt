They got one eye watching you
One eye, what you do?
So be careful who it is you’re talking to

They got one eye watching you
One eye, what you do?
So be careful what it is you’re tryin’ to do

And be careful when you’re walking into view
Just be careful when you’re walking into view

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on…

They got one eye watching you
And one eye, what you do?
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true

Bu-but don’t believe a word
It’s just us against the world
And we just gotta turn to be heard

I hear the crocodiles ticking ’round the world
I hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking ’round the world

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and hey!

I can hear them climbing the stairs
I got my left side, fight you on my left
Hiding under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you
