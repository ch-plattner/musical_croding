
Animals we are
Disposable, collapsible and raw
In you go into some crowded room
And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
But I should know which way to turn

An animal that runs
And I ran away from you because I'm scared
"Now off you go, off you go"

If you're gonna go, go now 
If you're gonna go, go now 
I forgot to tell you how 
So if you're gonna go
Go now 

Animal you are
Disposable defenceless yes and
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth 
An animal that runs
And I made all my excuses to you 
And I missed my chance by a stones throw

If you're gonna go, go now 
If you're gonna go, go now 
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go now

And I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal
