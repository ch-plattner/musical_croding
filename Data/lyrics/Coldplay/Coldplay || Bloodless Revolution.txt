But what is a battle when the war's already been won
People wanna break what's built
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt

Here's a needle, here's a thread
Sew yourself up, clear your head
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said

You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground
You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground

Look at all the cavemen goin'
Turning over to the shore
[?]

I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
