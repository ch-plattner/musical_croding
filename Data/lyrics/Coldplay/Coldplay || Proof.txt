
So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm covered, it's true
I'm covered in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light

So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say?
And are there things in your way?
Things happen that way

Oh

And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light
Light
Light
Light
Light
