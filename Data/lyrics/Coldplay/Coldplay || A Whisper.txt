A whisper [x4]
A whisper [x4]
I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks
Remember your face, and remember see where you are gone
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper [x2]

Night turns to day and I still have these questions
You just won't break, should I go forwards or backwards
Night turns to day and I've still got no answers

Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper [x2]

Now I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks
Remember your face, and remember see where you are gone
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper [x2]
