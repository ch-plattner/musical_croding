
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it, oh, for it?

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under-prepared
But I'll wait for it

If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah.

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it, oh, for it?

Singing
Please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, to me

Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah
