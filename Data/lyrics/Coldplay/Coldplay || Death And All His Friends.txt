
All winter we got carried
Oh way over on the rooftops let's get married.
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry.
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry.

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry.

And don't worry.

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end;
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge;
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends.

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end;
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge;
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends.

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making escape.

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making escape.
