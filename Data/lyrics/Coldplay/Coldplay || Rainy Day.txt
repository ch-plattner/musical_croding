
Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night is the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay
And we can listen

Oh rainy day come around
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
And oh but I love when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
I spent the night with the queen of Spain
My lonely little heart well it broke again
Time so vicious
The deeper that the knife goes in
The more you win
You end up with less than where you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in

Oh rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

And I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
