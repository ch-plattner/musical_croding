
If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two

And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

Ooh...

Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

Your eyes closed 
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Ooh...

Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope

For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you 
For you
