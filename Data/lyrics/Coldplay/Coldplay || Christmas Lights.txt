
Christmas night,
Another fight,
Tears we cried,
A flood
Got all kinds of poison in, of poison in my blood

I took my feet
To Oxford Street,
Trying to right a wrong
"Just walk away," those windows say, but I can't believe she's gone.

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they flow
And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope

And like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I've always loved you, darling, and I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on

Oowwwhhhohooooowohohohoooo

Oh Christmas lights light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on
