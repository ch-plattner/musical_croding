'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You
Ooohooh

'Cause you do

Oh you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street every car every surface a name
Tonight the streets are ours
And weâ€™re writing and saying
Don't let them take control
No we won't let them take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous,
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax,
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?

So on concrete canvas under cover of dark
On concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I'll be armed with a spray can soul

You
Ooohooh

Oh, you
Ooohooh

Yes, you
You use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Woho-ooh
Woho-oooh

It's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
It hurts like heaven
