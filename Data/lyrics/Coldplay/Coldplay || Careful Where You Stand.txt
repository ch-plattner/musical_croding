
I feel safe
I feel warm
When you're here, can I do no wrong?
I am cured, when I'm by you're side
I'm alright, yes I'm alright

I'm safe when I am with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured, when I'm by your side
I'm alright

[Chorus:]
Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always there
Looking out for one another

I feel safe when I'm with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured when you're all alone
I'm alright

[Chorus]

So I'd like a quiet town, please
I'd like a quiet town

Oh now now
Oh now now
And careful where you stand
And careful where you stand
