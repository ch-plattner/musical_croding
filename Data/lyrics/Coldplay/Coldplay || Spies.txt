
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad cos you know
But the spies hide out in every corner
But you can’t touch them no
Cos they’re all spies 
They’re all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We’re all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said which way do I turn
I forget everything I learned

But the spies came out of the water
But you’re feeling so bad cos you know
But the spies hide out in every corner,
But you can’t touch them no
Cos they’re all spies they’re all spies

And if we don’t hide here
They’re going to find us
If we don’t hide now
They’re going to catch us where we sleep
And if we don’t hide here
They’re going to find us 

And the spies came out of the water
And you’re feeling so good cos you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can’t touch you no
Cos they’re just spies
They’re just spies
They’re just spies
They’re just spies
They’re just spies
