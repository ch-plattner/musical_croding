Sat on a roof
Named every star
Shed every bruise and
Showed every scar

Sat on a roof
Your hand in mine, singing
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and it's weight"
Here I just wanna stay

Amazing day [x2]

Sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be who you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day [x4]

And I asked every book
Poetry, chime
"Can there be breaks
In the chaos of times?"
Oh, thanks God
You must've heard when I prayed
Because now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day [x4]
