
So it's over
This time, I know, it's gone
Salt water
You tasted it too long
I only know one role
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time, you're flyin' home
This time, I know no song
Can't stop it slowly go
Can't stop it slowly go

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

Could we pour some water on?
