
They were sitting 
They were sitting on the strawberry swing 
Every moment was so precious 

They were sitting 
They were talking under strawberry swing 
Everybody was for fighting 
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing 

Cold, cold water bring me round 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Cold, cold water what ya say? 
When it's such… 
It's such a perfect day 
It's such a perfect day 

I remember 
We were walking up to strawberry swing 
I can't wait until the morning 
Wouldn't wanna change a thing 

People moving all the time 
Inside a perfectly straight line 
Don't you wanna curve away? 
When it's such… 
It's such a perfect day 
It's such a perfect day 

Now the sky could be blue 
I don't mind 
Without you it's a waste of time 

Could be blue 
I don’t mind 
Without you it’s a waste of time 

Could be blue, 
Could be grey 
Without you I’m just miles away 

Could be blue 
I don’t mind 
Without you it’s a waste of time
