
Stuck in a corner
Are monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
To fight one another
Try to recover

Climb up the ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

How soon is now, yeah?
How long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
With something together
Come on and stick together

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer
