
Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives its the time of your lives
Break down, break down
Got to spread love around, got to spread it around

Brothers and sisters feel fine
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives
There's no sound, no sound
Like this feeling you found like this feeling you found

But just stay down
Cause sometimes you feel
So stay down
And sometimes you feel
And it's me they're lookin' for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some more

Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives
Breakdown, breakdown
Got to spread love around, got to spread it all around

But just stay down
And sometimes you feel
So stay around
And sometimes you'll feel
And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But well be around some more

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright
