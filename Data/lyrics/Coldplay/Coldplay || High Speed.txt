
Can anybody fly this thing?
Before my head explodes,
Or my head starts to ring.

We've been living life inside a bubble,
We've been living life inside a bubble.

Confidence in you,
Is confidence in me,
Is confidence in high speed.

Can anybody stop this thing?
Before my head explodes,
Or my head starts to ring.

We've been living life inside a bubble,
We've been living life inside a bubble.

Confidence in you,
Is confidence in me,
Is confidence in high speed.

High speed,
High speed.

High speed you on,
High speed you on,
High speed you on,
High speed.
