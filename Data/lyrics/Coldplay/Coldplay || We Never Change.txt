
I wanna live life, and never be cruel,
I wanna live life, and be good to you.

I wanna fly,
And never come down,
And live my life,
And have friends around.

We never change, do we?
No, no.
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house,

I wanna live life, and always be true,
I wanna live life, and be good to you,

I wanna fly,
And never come down,
And I live my life,
And have friends around.

We never change, do we?
No, no.
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house,
Where making more friends would be easy.

Oh and I don't have a soul to save,
Yes, and I sin every single day,

We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?
So, I wanna live in a wooden house,
Where making more friends would be easy.
I wanna live where the sun comes out.
