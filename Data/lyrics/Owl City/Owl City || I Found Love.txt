
I was so young and reckless
It was all a blur but there you were
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never
I'll hold you close, the end is near
But love goes on, and on forever

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

When the sparks, flew between us
I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
Til' the story end, and back again
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So lead me home, and lift me up
Above the stars, and even higher
I'm not afraid, because your love
It falls like rain, and burns like fire

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

I'll love you forever
And you were my dream come true
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love
