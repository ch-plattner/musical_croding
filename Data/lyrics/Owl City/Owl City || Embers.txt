There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark
And the fire brought me to life

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And you'll find there'll be mornings
When the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion
And you'll never stop 'cause you know
Yeah you know, it gets better
And your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah, the coals are beginning to glow

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

Don't let the fire die
It gets better
Just don't let the fire die, no

'Cause we're burning bright (burning bright)
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky (watch the sky)
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die
Don't let the fire die.
