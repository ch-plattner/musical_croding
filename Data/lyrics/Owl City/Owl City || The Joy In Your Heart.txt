
I'm the snow
Look out below
And bundle up
'Cause here I come

Skies of grey
This holiday
But spirits shine so bright
They don't need the sun

'Cause love is the fire
In your fireplace
And carefree are the snowflakes
That fall on your face

And although this winter
May bring us a storm
The joy in your heart
Keeps you warm
Yeah, the joy in your heart
Keeps you warm
