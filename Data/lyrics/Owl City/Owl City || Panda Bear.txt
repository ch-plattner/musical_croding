
I'm moving to Tokyo
Cuz I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void 
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos can reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above 
The east river when you are in love
We're staring at all these lights 
And I am going blind

Fill all of the navy yards
With hard working security guards
Cuz the numbers are wearing out
My plastic access card
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stay
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath the snowy veil
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale
