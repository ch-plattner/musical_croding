You and me thick as thieves,
Parachute like falling leaves.
A million miles can not divide,
My heart from yours and yours from mine.

When the space gets longer,
The stars get stronger.
If we ever get lost, we can find a way, we can find a way.
There's not a road that I wouldn't ponder (Ponder.... [x3])

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a Sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere, everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a Sleepwalker.

I tried to find you in my dreams,
2000 leagues under the sea.
(I tried to find you in my dreams
2000 leagues under the sea).

Up against the looking glass,
I see the memories of our past.
(Up against the looking glass,
I see the memories of our past).

'Cause when the waves get longer,
The sky gets smaller.
If we ever get lost, gotta find a way, gotta find a way
Into the ocean your river wanders (wanders.... [x3])

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.

(Sleepwalker...Sleepwalker...)

Up All Night,
Can't got to sleep with you by my side.
I turn the light on when I see a trace of my pillow talker.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.
I don't know where I am,
I'm falling down the stairs.
I'm looking everywhere everywhere.
Up all night,
I'd be a goner.
Without you I'm just a sleepwalker.

(Sleepwalker...Sleepwalker...)
