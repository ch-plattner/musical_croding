
That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb.
Rigged up, and ready to drop!
Bad news, I'm a fuse, and I've met my match.
So stand back, it's about to go off!

That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger, when I look in her eyes.
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise.
So I'm running, 'cause I've run out of time.

She’s a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate!
I’m James Bond, live to die another day!
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite!
She’s all I want so I, I’m on a mission tonight!
(I, I'm on a mission tonight!)

Her love is a drug laced with ecstasy,
And her charm is spiked with a spell.
A hot mess in a dress gets the best of me.
She's ice cold, but she's making me melt!
