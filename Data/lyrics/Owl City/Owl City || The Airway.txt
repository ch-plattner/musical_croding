
When I am fast asleep 
I dream and see you floating high above me 
And I awake at dawn 
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn 
From on the bedroom floor 
I watch you sailing far above the seashore 

In deep Atlantic skies 
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise 
Above the avenue 
I search above the clouds, trying to see you 
But you are just a blur 
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor 

I can see 
You above with the ocean around me 
If I could only stay 
Overhead in the airway 
You sail through 
Endless sky with the evening around you 
When I'm out on the bay 
You're aloft in the airway 

When I'm alone at night 
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight 
Suspended in the air 
I wish your silhouette would always stay there 
When I am on the beach 
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach 

But I can not take flight 
Or float upon the air the way that you might 
When I am in the sea 
You gazed down from the sky, trying to see me 
But I am just a blur 
Through the waves, as I scuba dive below the harbor 

The airway 
You and I in the airway 
Aloft in the airway 
In love in the airway 

I can see 
You above with the ocean around me 
If I could only stay 
Overhead in the airway 
You sail through 
Endless sky with the evening around you 
When I'm out on the bay 
You're aloft in the airway
