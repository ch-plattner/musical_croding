
I saw your face in a criminal sketch
Don't be alarmed 'cause you don't know me yet
I'm on the prowl now, sniffing around this town for you
Calling all cars, there's an officer down
Shot to the heart on the night on the town, and
The evidence of your fingerprints was found, and now

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

Oh no, here we go once again
We both know you'll never turn yourself in
So I'm driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout
(Driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout)
Pick up the pace as I chase you around
One of these days I'll end up tracking you down
But yeah, I've got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do

Because you, you got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
(Love is a high speed chase racing down the street)

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

I'm coming after you
I'm coming after you!
