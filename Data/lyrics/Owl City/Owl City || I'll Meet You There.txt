
If we could sit together a moment
And talk forever just to pass the time
I would smile as the shivers and chills run down my spine
With your eyes are locked on mine 

Oh we will fill the metro skies with country air
And when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

Deep inside of you there's a ruby glow 
And it gets brighter then you and I will ever know
There's a rushing sound that surrounds us when we walk alone
And it's everything we've never known

Wander down the street
And I would be the pavement beneath your feet
If we could just be immobile for some time 
And finally figure out the way we feel
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks
It still looks a bit surreal

Oh I tend to disappear here and there
So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere
And well feel the metro skies with country air
If you're lost when you close your eyes I'll meet you there

You could be anywhere
I'll meet you there
You could be anywhere
Open your eyes and see everything you can be
I'll meet you there
