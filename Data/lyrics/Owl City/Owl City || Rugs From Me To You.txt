Toupee or not toupee 
That is the question 
It refused to stay as it all turned grey; 
William Shakespeare's receding hair 
Please excuse the pun, 
'It's hair today, gone tomorrow' 
So be thankful 
For what precious locks you have 

Toupee or not toupee 
That is the question 
And by the way 
I just gotta say 
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald 
And if I may quip 
My curls and I 
Are just like heaven 
'Cause rest assured 
There'll be no parting there 

But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck 
(Our chase to swallow)
It makes me smile 
'Cause I know just what I'd do 

Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with 
I'd open a secondhand store 
And if you ever went bald 
You'd recall it 
'Cause I'd cleverly call it 
'Rugs From Me To You'
