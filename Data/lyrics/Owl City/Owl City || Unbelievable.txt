
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate Spaghetti-Os, played laser tag and G.I. Joes
And if you vowed "no girls allowed, " then you could join the club
When I was a kid I spent my Saturdays
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was "Lion King, " and I could feel the love

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Hanson:]
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, ate Dr. Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" was how real the raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, and it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Gak, Pogs, and Floam, and "Home Alone, " "Berenstein Bears" and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-Sketch
What happens next?
Grape Juicy Juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip 'N Slides, McDonald's fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

It's unbelievable
When I think back I'm amazed
It's unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It's unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

(It's so amazes)
(Those were the days!)
