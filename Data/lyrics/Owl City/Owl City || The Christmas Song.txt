
It's Christmas and we walk alone
Two strangers with no one to miss us
On our own, out in the cold

Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm

I don't have anyone at home to talk to
And you don't have anything to do
So I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x2]

I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x2]

It's Christmas and we are in love
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us
From far above the blustery breeze

Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm

I believe that Jesus is truly the only way
And I celebrate Christmas because it's his birthday
(it's his birthday)

I don't have anyone at home to talk to
And you don't have anything to do
So I'll spend my Christmas with you

(ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba) [x12]

I'll spend my Christmas with you
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)
