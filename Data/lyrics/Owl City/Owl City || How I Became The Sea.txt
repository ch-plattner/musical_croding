June was the lobster shell
I dug by hand
A haven that hid me well
Beneath the sand
The wide windy waves washed in
But I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again
As I nodded off inside

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream

When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

I wrenched the engines off
And drank them down
The depths turned the iron soft
As they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side
To its rusty knees
As I felt the even tide
Deep in my shallow dreams

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream
When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

When the sky fell in
(When the sky fell in)
(When the sky fell in)
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
(How I became the sea)

(When the sky fell in)
(When the hurricanes came for me)
(I could finally crash again)
(And that's how I became the sea)

(How I became the sea)
