[Chorus]
Where was I when the rockets came to life?
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

[Verse]
Remember to breathe, because it'll take your breath away,
When the engines cough, and you blast off.
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash.
Remember to live, 'cause you're gonna be thrilled to death,
When the stars collide and your eyes grow wide.
Take it in with your breath against the glass.
Remember to dream because it's gonna be a starry night,
Over every town, if you look down.
So harmonize with the singing satellites.
Remember to scream because you're gonna be lost for words,
When the sparks erupt and they light you up.
Dip your toes in the galaxy 'cause it's yours to explore tonight.

[Chorus]
Where was I when the rockets came to life?
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

[Bridge]
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere,
I'm drowning in this starry serenade,
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier,
My imagination's taking me away.

Reverie whisper in my ear,
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid,
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere,
My imagination's taking me away.

[Verse]
Let's hear it for the Universe,
Where it never hurts,
Diving in head-first.
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way.
And remember to laugh 'cause you're living in a crazy world,
Where you'll never guess what could happen next.
Give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away.

[Chorus]
Where was I when the rockets came to life?
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Where was I when the rockets came to life?
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

In The Alligator Sky,
In The Alligator Sky,
In The Alligator Sky.
