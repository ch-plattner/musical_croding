
Well it's Christmas time
And I'm warm inside
Despite the bitter cold
Cause you're here with me
And I guarantee
My heart is yours to hold

So we smile below
This mistletoe
As if we need a hint
And the falling snow
Well I bet it knows
How love can pull you in

Oh-ohh oh!

Little lights flash in your eyes
Glowing by the fireside
Leave the presents on the floor
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for

Oh let me lead the way
This holiday

Lets fly around the world tonight woah-oh yeah
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
I love the way you hold me tight oh-oh yeah
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time

Little lights flash in your eyes
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
Can't fight the way I feel inside
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time

Oh let me lead the way
This holiday

Well it's Christmas time
And I'm warm inside
Despite the bitter cold
And it's crystal clear
That this Christmas cheer
Is healthy for the soul

Little lights flash in your eyes
Glowing by the fireside
Leave the presents on the floor
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for

Oh let me lead the way
This holiday, this holiday

Let's fly around the world tonight woah-oh
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
I love the way you hold me tight oh yeah
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time

Little lights flash in your eyes
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
Can't fight the way I feel inside
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time

Oh let me lead the way
This holiday, this holiday

Let's fly around the world tonight woah-oh yeah
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
I love the way you hold me tight oh yeah
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
