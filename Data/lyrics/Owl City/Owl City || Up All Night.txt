
I fell in love with a ghost
Oh, under the moonlight
You took my hand and held me close
For once I was alright

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
Alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Woah oh oh oh 

Its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

I tossed and turned in the end
With no one to talk to
I searched again and again
But I never found you

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
Alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Woah oh oh oh 

I'm gonna be up all night, woah oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

Woah oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night, woah oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

You were my clarity, I swear
Alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

(Gonna be up all night)
(And now I'm gonna be up all night)

A whisper on the air
Made my heart rate fall
When I heard you call
And I swear, I could hear your voice in my ear
But there was no one there at all
