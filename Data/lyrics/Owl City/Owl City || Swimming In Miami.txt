
I'm alone above the atmosphere
And no one looking up can find me here
Cause I can close my eyes, and disappear
When I climb the stairs to watch the sun
Above station walls, the colors run
To fill the swimming pool when I am done

I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins

When the satellites hang all around
And I can hear the lovely sound
When all the engines of the back room die down
All the airships move across the sky
And my equipment just keeps standing by
The planets glow and intensify

I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins

When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but you can never tell

If you're alone in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door

In the evening night the boulevard
Conceals the night in disregard
For all the workers in a west coast ship yard
When I rearrange the silverware
And re-install the lights and captain's chair
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air

I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travels through your veins

When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but you can never tell'

If you're awake in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door
When you are swimming in Miami at night
And all around you are the traffic and city lights
