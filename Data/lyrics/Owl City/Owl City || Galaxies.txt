
Call back the cap com,
Tick off the time bomb,
Let felicity fly.

Armor the air lock,
Blanket the bed rock,
And kiss the planet goodbye.

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

Da da da da da dada da

Fight back the flight deck,
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse

Summit the sunset
Dubtail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits.

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

Oh telescope,
Keep an eye on my only hope,
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road,
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me,
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need.
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

I would follow this far.

(Through the galaxy)

Da da da da da dada da
