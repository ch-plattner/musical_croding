Good evening, shuttle bus! Tell me where you're going to take us
Someplace that I have never been
It's chic transportation to new destination where I leave my reflection on the glass
I'd ask but we don't know how far these interstates go
Or how deep the city roots go down
In chilly sub-depth railways, the weathered concrete stairways provide me with a means of getting home... if I ever leave

On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand
While soothing words hover like hummingbirds

So many sights to see so wake up like an early birdie
And we'll get a head start on the day
Stained-glass skyways and crowded 6 lane highways
If I look back when I begin to leave, will they remember me?

Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
And tour guides make happy brides feel heaven-sent
