We wrote a prelude to our own fairytale.
And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale
And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.
We round a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs.
I lit a match and let it catch to light up the room.
And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon.

Hot air balloon

I'll be out of my mind
and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
in a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind.
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

la la la la la la
la la la la la la

We drank the great lakes like cold lemonade.
And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade.
So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.
You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.

I'll be out of my mind
and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
in a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

I'll be out of my mind
and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
in a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.
