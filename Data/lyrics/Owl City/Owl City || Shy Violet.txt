Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

She dried my eyes and drifted off
While every tear was held aloft
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible
'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful

Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

Beautiful

'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful.
