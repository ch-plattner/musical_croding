Just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
I walk and cry while my heart beat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun don’t shine through this window of mine
‘Cause it’s dark at the home of the blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
And dreams that I’ve had left me feeling so bad
I just wanna give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems that there’s no good way to choose
Well come along with me, misery loves company
And you’re welcome at the home of the blues
‘Cause just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’re gonna find me at the home of the blues
