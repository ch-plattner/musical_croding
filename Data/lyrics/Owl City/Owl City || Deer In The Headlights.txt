
Met a girl in the parking lot,
And all I did was say hello.
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

Met a girl with a graceful charm,
But when beauty met the beast he froze.
Got the sense I was not her type
By black eye and bloody nose,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

It's suffocating to say,
But the female mystique takes my breath away.
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried, deer in the headlights.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
If life was a game, you would never play nice.
If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.

You're the deer in the headlights.
You're the deer in the headlights.
