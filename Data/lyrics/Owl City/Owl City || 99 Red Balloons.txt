
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in a summer sky
99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust there was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go
