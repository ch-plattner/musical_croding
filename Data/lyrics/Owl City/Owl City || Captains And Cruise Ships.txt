I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you
