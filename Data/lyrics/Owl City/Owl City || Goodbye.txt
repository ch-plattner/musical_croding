I was a hot mess
In my Sunday best
Black tears in my eyes
You were my first love
You were my only one
I can't believe your lies

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

You got a new friend
You like to play pretend
I'm just keepin' my cool
Turn on the smoke machine
Magic and make believe
She'll never know you like I do

Once we were a fire burnin'
Now you're just a lesson I'm learning

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me
[4x]

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I gotta say goodbye
This isn't easy 
I gotta say goodbye
