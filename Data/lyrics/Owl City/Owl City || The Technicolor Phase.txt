
I am the red in the rose, the flowers
on the blankets on your bedroom floor.
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides
with your clothes behind your closet door.

I am the green in the grass that bends back
from underneath your feet.
And I am the blue in your back alley view
where the horizon and the rooftops meet.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars.
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are.
(wherever you are) [2x]

(I will always meet your gaze)
when we are lost in the technicolor phase)

I am the black in the book
the letters on the pages that you memorize.
And I am the orange in the overcast
a color that you visualize.

I am the white in the walls that soak up
all the sound when you cannot sleep.
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
that wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars. (my darling)
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are. (my darling)

(wherever you are) [3x]
