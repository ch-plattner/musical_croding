
The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbird's red
And explosions never make a sound

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

My captain on the snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
(Is coming back to take me home)
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

Oh, comet come
(Oh, comet come down)
(down)

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in, bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
