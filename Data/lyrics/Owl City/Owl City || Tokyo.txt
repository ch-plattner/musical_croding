
Feels like I've been away for a thousand years
So tired of these airports and souvenirs
I shiver in the night and I think of you 

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align (when I'm in Tokyo)
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I wander all alone in the pouring rain
Ride shotgun on the wind in a bullet train
I shiver in the night and I think of you

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align 
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align 
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most

I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast

Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)
