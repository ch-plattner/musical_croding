
She wound a thread around the pieces of my broken heart
And left me to believe
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

A starry night without a fear of heights
I can't recall, 'cause I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
Da da da da da da daaaaa (girls, girls don't wanna leave)

I miss the way she whispered in my ear
Before she left, had me so convinced
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

And Juliet's romantic balcony
Wears out the wall, but I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

When you're alone
I hope my ghost never leaves
'Cause when I'm home
Your painful memory is always haunting me

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing me

When I see you around, my eyes go wide
When you race through my mind, I die inside
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
