I tried to disappear but you're the only reason I'm floating here
Eyes, painted crystal clear, I can see our future through the atmosphere

Don't you go, no don't you go
Don't you know, I'm up here alone
Yeah I am like a satellite, sending you a signal tonight

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love
(Do do do do do do)

You were so hard to find, with oh so many clouds across my summer sky
You, my constellation prize, yeah, every single star is sparkling in your eyes

So don't you go, no don't you go
'Cause don't you know, I'm up here alone
So high like a satellite, I'm sending you a signal tonight

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

One track, one mind, one race to win
One start, one heart, one life to live
One track, one mind, one race to win
One start, one heart, one life to live

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up
Everybody's racing at the speed of love

Oh! Oh! Oh! Like a streak of light (Don't you go, no don't you go)
Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch the world fly by (Don't you know, I'm up here alone)
Oh! Oh! Oh! Rev your engine up (Don't you go, no don't you go)
Everybody's racing at the speed of love!
