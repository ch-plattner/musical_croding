
When I’m dressed to the nines
I’m just a shirt and tie
With a taste for prestige
And beautiful mystery
But clever girls dressed to kill
Are pretty bittersweet
And better suited for grief 
Than beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
She enjoys it the most
With flowers in her hair
Dressing up like a ghost
For beautiful mystery
And so I kiss her goodnight
And stumble from the room 
Mighty high on mystique
And beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
