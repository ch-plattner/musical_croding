
I saw a ghost on the stairs,
And sheets on the tables and chairs,
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink,
Even so, I don't know, what to think.

I've been longing for,
Daisies to push through the floor,
And I wish that plant life would grow all around me,
So I won't feel dead anymore.
So I won't feel dead anymore.

I saw a bear in the den,
Reading my textbooks again,
Bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic,
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend.

[CHORUS]
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

I've been longing for,
Daisies to push through the floor,
And I wish that plant life would grow all around me,
So I won't feel dead anymore.
So I won't feel dead anymore.

Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet,
And give me a ghost of a smile,
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're teddy beneath,
So just grin and bear it a while.
Just grin and bear it a while.

[CHORUS]
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

Tonight I'm busting out
Of this old haunted house.
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for
All the spider webs to grow all around me.
'Cause I don't feel dead anymore.
And I'm not afraid anymore.

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?
