Well I’ve been huddled up alone
By the fire even though
I’m not exactly feeling cold
And I’ve been bundled up for days
Too confused to be amazed
At all the icy water in my veins
Why do I feel so alone?
Yeah I’ve been moving in and out
Of this old split-level house
And I’d just as soon burn the whole place down
‘Cause I quit working lumberyards
To build a mansion out of cards
But I feel thin behind these paper walls
Why do I feel so alone?
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
Well I’ve been painting through the night
In the basement out of sight
Brushing paper tigers black and white
‘Cause come tomorrow afternoon
I’ll fill a helium balloon
And set them free into the baby blue sky
So they won’t have to be alone
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
But when I close these heavy lids after dark
Each sweet dream is a target
And all my shots are so consistently wide of the mark
‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite
Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn’t invite
But if the prettiest romance isn’t perfectly right
That makes every love lost just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Just a holiday every night
Well I’ve been huddled up alone
By the fire even though
I’m not exactly feeling cold
But how my heartache hit the trail 
When a paper tiger tail
Fluttered down, I guess I’ll never know
