Lead the way, and lets get it started, 
Seize the day, and reach for the sky,
Carry on, 'cause those broken hearted days are gone,
So wave good bye,

We're gonna blow up because we've got nothing to lose,
We're gonna rise up above when we've break all the rules,
We're gonna re-write the book 'cause its long over-due,
Tear up the script this is in 'cause its all up to you!

Because tomorrow, will show up on time,
Its gonna follow, the night of your life,
You know, tomorrow, begins when you say-
'Tomorrow is on it's way, so lets live it up today!'
Lets live it up today!

Pack your bags, adventure is waiting,
Gonna have, the ride of your life,
Smile wide, 'cause theres no debating,
It feels so right, so hold on tight!

We're gonna blow up because we've got nothing to lose,
We're gonna rise up above when we've break all the rules,
We're gonna re-write the book 'cause its long over-due,
Tear up the script this is in 'cause its all up to you!

Because tomorrow, will show up on time,
Its gonna follow, the night of your life,
You know, tomorrow, begins when you say-
'Tomorrow is on it's way, so lets live it up today!'

Today, lets live it up, lets live it up, today-ay-ay, 
Lets live it up today!

Because tomorrow, will show up on time,
Its gonna follow, the night of your life,
You know, tomorrow, begins when you say-
'Tomorrow is on it's way, so lets live it up today!'
