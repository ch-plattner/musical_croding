
Just before the dawn,
When the light's still gone,
Shine, shine your way,
And you may not know, where to go,
Shine, shine your way

Open road but it's still dark,
Build a fire from a spark,
And shine, shine your way,
Feed the feeling in your heart,
Don't conceal it then you'll start,
To find, find your way

No one can stop, what has begun,
You must believe when I say

All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

There's an open sky,
And a reason why,
You shine, shine your way,
There's so much to learn,
And now it's your turn,
To shine, shine your way

There's a feeling deep inside,
You can let it be your guide,
To find, find your way,
And there's no time for us to waste,
Got to take a leap of faith,
And fly, fly away

Don't have to walk,
Now you can run,
Nothing can get in your way

All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

Morning is breaking,
Darkness is fading,
We found a way to the light,
It's such a beautiful sight

Any time, anywhere,
Turn around and I'll be there,
To shine, shine your way

Like a star burning bright,
Lighting up the darkest night,
I'll shine, shine your way

Now I can see,
You are the one,
Sent here to show me the way

All of our tears will dry faster in the sun,
Starting today,
Shine, shine, shine,
We're on our way,
Shine, shine, shine,
That's what we say,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way

There's a reason why
You shine, shine your way

All of our tears will dry faster in the sun
Shine your way
