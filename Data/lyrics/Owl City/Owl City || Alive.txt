
It gets cold the moment you close your eyes and so terribly dark.
It gets cold the moment I feel your pulse with no blood in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

It gets cold the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh, everynight.

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go
Spread your tiny wings cuz you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive

You make me feel alive

It gets real the moment you lose your grip and life tears you apart.
It gets real the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you, 
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you
Ohohoh everynight

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive.

You make me feel alive

(you make me feel alive)

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you, 
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you,
Ohohoh everynight..

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high

Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive [x3]

You make me feel alive [x2]
