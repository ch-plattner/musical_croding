
Wake up on your own
And look around you 'cause you're not alone
Release your high hopes and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive

Dive in and swim away
From your lonely nights and miserable days

And when you wake up on your own
Look around you 'cause you're not alone
Let your hopes go and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive
You're headed home,
You're headed home
