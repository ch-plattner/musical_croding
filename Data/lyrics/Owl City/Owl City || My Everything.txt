
When my hope is lost
And my strength is gone
I run to you and you alone
When I can't get up and I can't go on
I run to you and you alone

'Cause you're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You're my everything

When I'm plagued with pain
And filled with fear
I run to you and you alone
When my days are few
And death is near
I run to you and you alone

'Cause you're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

When trouble comes and goes
And when the cold wind blows
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
When sorrow knocks me down
And you pick me off the ground
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
And I sing

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say

Hallelujah
By the grace of God above
Hallelujah
I'll shine a light 'cause I am loved
This is all I know I will say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You're my everything

Ohh Ohh, You're my everything
