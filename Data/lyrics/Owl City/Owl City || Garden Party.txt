I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
But no one recognized me, I didn’t look the same

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

People came from miles around and everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan’s shoes, wearing his disguise

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

I played them all the old songs, I thought that’s why they came
But no one heard the music, we didn’t look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
And when I sang a song about a Honky Tonk, it was time to leave

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Good
Playing guitar like ringing a bell and looking like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang, I’d rather drive a truck

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

You can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself
