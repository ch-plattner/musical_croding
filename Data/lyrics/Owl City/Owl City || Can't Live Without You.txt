
All the thoughts in my head spinning 'round like a hurricane
And life leaves me so confused
When I trip and I fall I collapse like a tidal wave
So I'm crying out to you

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(I hope you know) I can't live without you
(I hope you know) I can't live without you

When I'm hit like a hook to the jaw in a title fight
I'm down and I'm knocked out cold, you know
And with my heart broke apart like a wreck in a shallow tide
Yeah I've never felt this low

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(I hope you know) I can't live without you
(I hope you know) I can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
