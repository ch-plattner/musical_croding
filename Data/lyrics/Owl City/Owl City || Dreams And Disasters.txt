
We were alone on the road driving faster
So far from home we were chasing disaster
Hard on the gas 'till the car caught on fire
We had to laugh as the smoked billowed higher
I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

Think of the sun, and the sound of it rising
Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon

I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters!
