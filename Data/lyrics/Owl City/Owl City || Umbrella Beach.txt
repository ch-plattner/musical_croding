
Stems and gears, oh how the daisies bloom
When chandeliers light up the engine room
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
There's an underwater Ferris wheel
Where I found the missing link to this island chain

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

I'll spread my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach
