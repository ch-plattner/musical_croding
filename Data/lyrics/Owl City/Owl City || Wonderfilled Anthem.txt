
Wonder if I gave an Oreo to the Big Bad Wolf,
how would the story go?
Would he still go huff and puff 
or would he bring those pigs cool stuff
to decorate the deck he helped them build?
Would they not get killed? 

Wonder if I gave an Oreo to a vampire in a creepy show,
would he not act so undead?
Would he thirst for milk instead?
I've just got this feeling that it might work out all right.

‘Cause cream does wondrous things 
inside a chocolate sandwich dream.

If I gave 'em to great white sharks, 
would they share 'em with baby seals? 
Would they call up a giant squid for a friendly meal?
Wonder if I gave an Oreo…
Wonder if I gave an Oreo… 
What if I gave an Oreo to you?
