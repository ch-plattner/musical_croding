[Hook:]
I won't stay here another night
If I gotta sacrifice
Who I am on the inside
I'd rather be an outsider
And you can stay if you'd like
I'll see you on the other side
I wanna live the free life
I'd rather be an outsider [5x]

[Verse 1 - Lecrae:]
Yeah
Outsiders
I really can't tell if I'm over-dressed or I'm under-dressed
If I'm under-paid, or just over-stressed
If I'm cynical, or just over this
Cause I'm tired of trying to get over them
Man, it's over then, party's over
You probably couldn't tell that we over here, because you hardly sober
Double shots in that ego
They laughing at us, yeah, we know
Maybe at the bottom, but we not forgotten
The directors plotting that sequel
Till' then we live on the outside
And it might storm and we might die
But, I'd rather go where my fist high
Standing outside of your inside
I tried my best to fit in
Looking for a suit to fit in
Standing outside of your prison
Trying to find ways I could get in
Now I realize that I'm free
And I realize that I'm me
And I found out that I'm not alone cause' there's plenty people like me
That's right there's plenty people like me
All love me, despite me
And all unashamed and all unafraid to speak out for what we might see
I said there's plenty people like me
All outsiders like me
And all unashamed and all unafraid to live out what they supposed to be

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lecrae:]
Uh
I know what they asking for, I know what they asking for
But, how you gonna come and charge me, my life is sold, and then turn around and ask for more
Time to go, plus the line is long
I'ma color the outside, but lines a drone
If you wanna exclude me, for being the true me
It's Gucci, I already found my home
Homesick
Homeless, if I'm on this
Cause' my home is somewhere I ain't never been before
I'ma own this here gift, even if it doesn't fit in the box that'll bleed these folks
Some of ya'll don't need these quotes
I ain't tryna' eat, I'm tryna' feed these folks
Martin, Mandela, yeah, we need these folks
We believe these folks
We can be these folks
Yeah
But they want me to take an L
Tired of taking losses, so they can call me a failure
I failed at being you, but I'm winning at being me
I'm winning at being free, ain't no competition but me
See I realize that I'm free
And I realize that I'm me
And I found out that I'm not alone, and there's plenty of people like me
I said there's plenty of people like me
All outsiders like me
All unashamed and all unafraid to live out what they supposed to be
Outsiders!

[Outro:]
You spend your time
So many lives
Turn on the lights
Open your eye
We'll be running through the night
It's brighter on the other side
Somethings bigger than You and I
Brighter on the other side [5x]
