[Flame:]
(We so impressed)
With them ladies
Who be drivin' Mercedes
Who be drivin' them crazy
And we gotta be crazy
(We so impressed)
With them fellas
Who be makin' them jealous
Who be makin' them stellas
And we gotta be crazy
(I'm so impressed)
King who on the throne
Who left his heavenly home
Never did a thing wrong
They crucified him on
A tree, there he made
It was crazy how it set the stage
For his resurrection from the grave
That gets me amazed
(You can be) the flyest man
(With a) hundred grand in your hand
Swag right, sag tight
And a Gucci fan
(You can) be the richest, be the smartest, be the hardest, all of that
But I guarantee before I die they all are fallin' flat

[Hook:]
Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry
(Focused on the wrong stuff)
Now I got my eyes on you
And now I know that

[Chorus:]
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough-nough
Never too much-uch
More than enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough for me

[Lecrae:]
Party like the fast life, hurry this the last flight
Chasin' all your dreams, this right here could be your last night
And man you finally got your cash right
But it never seems to last right
You know you sick of lookin', you sick of chasin'
I think you know the truth, you just don't wanna face it
Your life is empty, though you havin' fun
You never satisfied, you never get enough
You go from thrill-seekin' to pill-poppin'
From heavy drinkin' to club-hoppin'
You just can't stop it, like you're a slave
And you chasin' nothin' all the way into the grave

[Hook:]
Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry
(Focused on the wrong stuff)
Now I got my eyes on you
And now I know that

[Chorus:]
God is enough
God is enough
God is enough
You are enough
Never too much
More than enough
God is enough
You are enough for me

[Lecrae:]
Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want
Takes away my fears, you restore my soul
Off into the sky, the dead in Christ arise
To be with you forever, see with the clearest eyes
Quench my inner thirst, there's something more in life
No money, cars, relationships compare to joy in Christ
Love that falls from selfish ones that like to flirt with self-destruct
No need to stut, know what I want, to keep it, but my God's enough

[Hook:]
Used to want a lotta things

And now I know that

[Chorus:]
God is enough
God is enough
God is enough
You are enough
Never too much
More than enough
God is enough
You are enough for me

I don't need these worldly things, no-oh
I don't need these worldly things, no-oh
More of you and less of me, G-od
More of you and less of me, G-od
I don't need these worldly things, no-oh
I don't need these worldly things, no-oh
More of you and less of me, G-od
More of you and less of me, G-od

[Chorus:]
God is enough
God is enough
God is enough
You are enough
Never too much
More than enough
God is enough
You are enough for me
