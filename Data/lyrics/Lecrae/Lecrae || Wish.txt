[Verse 1:]
Yeah
I wish I never held back
Wish nobody had to sell crack
Then I may have seen my dad a little more
Maybe I can dream a little more
But I still wishing on stars in the sky
Wish a lot of people was alive
And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth
But I know about a whole lot of lies
Man I wish I had me a time machine
I would tell Martin it was all a dream
And I wish like Ray Jay back in '06
Guess it worked 'cause I got my chick
And I wish like Kellz did
If I could change the clock
Man I'd change a lot
And I probably wouldn't be so selfish
I woulda gave a lot
Man I'm ashamed of that
I wish I coulda told O thank you
Before it got way too late
I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot
But time just fades away
I probably wish too much
I know I pray less than I should
I know I did too much
I take it all back if I could

[Hook:]
Wish I had another chance
Maybe I'll do better [x3]
Every time I think about all of my mistakes
I just wanna turn it around
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
If I never went there, I would never know
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Maybe I can turn it around

[Verse 2:]
I wish I didn't do it but I did it
Man it happened last night
Man I wish y'all would try to act like you ain't never lost your sight
And I don't even do it for the money
Except when I do it for the money
Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny
I wish I had ten more wishes
I swear I got ten more visions
And life is a game that I can't stop playing
Baby gimme like ten more minutes
I'm almost finished
I wish I had a little more time
I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe I'm a lose my mind
Before I get to those
Yeah I miss the goals
But my shot was off
Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost
But I probably missed my calling
Wish I was a little bit taller
Wish I was a baller
Then again every time I get a little money
I be looking at the next man like he smaller
I can't call it
And I wish I didn't go and get high on the one first date
I was all zoned out, paranoid like "did you hear that noise"
And I know she probably thinking I'm crae
No pun intended
I wish I repented
A little bit quicker
Then again I didn't pull the trigger
I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure

[Hook]
