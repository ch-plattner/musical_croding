[Hook - Novel:]
If I die tonight, I gon' know that I
Gave this with my everything
If I die tonight
If I die tonight, you ain't gotta cry
Cause I know that Heaven waits
If I die tonight
Only if I die tonight
Only if I die tonight
If I die tonight

[Verse 1 - Lecrae:]
If I die tonight
I pray to God that my time is right
And even though folks say time is money
You can't earn no more time tonight
And tell my girl, "Don't cry for me"
Cause I'm right here beside the King
And tell my boys, "Don't ride for me"
And stay unashamed to they flatline
Could of spent my time on that back nine
Smoking on the Cuban, sipping red wine
I could of hit the streets and done fed time
But my life ain't mine, it's His time
So
I ain't tryna waste my minutes
I don't even know my limits
But I gon' get it
Tell my kids I did what I could
And I love them dearly
Tell my sisters, "Love and don't give up"
Tell my bros I meant to get with them
And the truth I claim I take to my grave
And my faith is real, I'm no quitter
Just no hash tagging on Twitter
This that real life, so go live it
If I die tonight, they gon' close my casket
But I promise y'all I'm gon' get up

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lecrae:]
I'm about to be with my loved ones that I lost
And my life ain't never been perfect
But I have perfect faith in that Cross
So tell all the haters, "Your loss"
But I still love you, no fault
In this chess game, ain't no threat, man
Cause my King ain't never been caught
Tell my queen to pawn all my thoughts
Sell those songs the people ain't got
All these folks who with us for the last ten
And look at us, now we can't stop
Sometimes, the first one to lead
Is the first one to make big mistakes
And the first one to be criticized
And the first one to feel hate
But I swear the moves that I made
I was trying to work on my faith
I've been wrong before
But where I'm 'bout to go
They won't put it all in my face
I just dared to do what they scared to do
And if I die tonight, just know
I made me an heir or two

[Hook]
