[Hook: Dimitri McDowell & Lecrae]
Here we go again in circles
I think I heard it all
We been here before
But we need something more
Something more
Something more
What you say
I can't hear cause you
Ain't talking 'bout nuthin (ain't talking 'bout nuthin) [x4]
What you talking 'bout
They be talking 'bout the same old thing
I'm a have to call a foul in the game
What you talking 'bout
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Let me guess you counting money to the ceiling
Difference 'tween us like at least a couple million
It's foreign cars, pretty girls everywhere you go
Yeah I heard it 30 times on the radio
Lou Vuitton ain't gon' pay you for that bragging
And Donatella prolly never heard your album
Yeah they probably 'bout to label me a hater
But I know these people greater than the songs they created
It's little homies in the hood regurgitating
And everybody watching thinking that you made it
The truth is for a few designer labels and a little bit of paper now you 12 years slaving
Hey but you ain't Lupita
So why you beat up and pushing people to lean on the devil
Copping a seizure
It sound like you put your feet up
You still a slave and money can't buy you freedom partna'

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell & Lecrae]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Tell me why the song's on in my car (hear the radio)
Why the song on in my gym (what they saying now)
And the song's stuck in my head (I can't take no more)
I still don't know what y'all saying
Lemme lemme lemme do this
I'm a be a straight shooter
And we was made in his image
Why we so Judas
Talking bread like we at the last supper
Throwing money at these women make it rain in the summer
I ain't advertising brands on the radio
They expensive and I know they ain't gon' pay me for
Telling kids to go in debt, for the 'vette that they'll prolly never get
But I talk about it every song
And every song talking 'bout they selling work on every corner
Don't talk about the laws, taking kids away from mommas
Don't talk about your homie in the trauma cause he shot up
Or what about your young boy messing up the product
They don't talk about the bond money that they ain't have
And everybody snitch on everybody in the jam
They don't talk about the pain, they don't talk about the struggle
How they turn to the Lord when they ran into trouble
I'm a talk about it
I don't care if the world try to swallow me
I turn my back to 'em, tell 'em all follow me
I know you gon' label me a hater
But inside you are greater than the songs you creating man

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Hey man, the way I see it
I think we were made for more
Than just, ya know, the simple things that we aspire toward
We were made for more than just telling stories about
How much money we can get by selling poison to people
It's time to talk about who we are and who we can be
And we need to build each other up and not put each other down
I feel like we not talking about nothing right now
