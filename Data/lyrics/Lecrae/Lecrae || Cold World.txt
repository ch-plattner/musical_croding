We live in a cold, cold world [x4]

These folks is killing for less money than they can borrow
Create and you will sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim fleshing out his anger
Coloring cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And the daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he would counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is getting older, streets is making him colder
But his momma's out cold, cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister's 15, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonalds selling poison, got people working for cheap an
The military, drug's, or prison only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in

We live in a cold, cold world [x4]

This world's cold like no clothes and snow blown
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of stripping, she need hope up in my words, man
She pull up to the mall where she valet her little Mercedes
Wishing she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's accepting her plight, she's a lady of the night.
And she saw 'em in the park with his daughter, they holding hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance,
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance.

It's a cold world, real cold world
Jermaine called that thing, man where is we going turn
A lot of people thinking I'm on an hopeless endeavor, nah
I know someone who can change the weather forever, ever

We live in a cold, cold world [x4]
