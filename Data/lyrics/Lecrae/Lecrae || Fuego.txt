I'm all in preach Jesus til I'm short winded
Come gossip pouring up living water and lyrics
This ain't rap this bartending 
And I'm back in the back snap back to the back
With a pack full of cats that'll strap with the fact 
Christ when he ask to revive in the tracks 
Turn they're life into maps with the gospel we pack
Look I'm of one life but for Him I spend every cent though 
I know this life it comes with pain 
But it's through our pain we win though
Could be made like Him so treat these streets like flint bro 
Cause our God can spark up the dark 
In the hearts of the hardest departed let's go 

Treat every night like it's the last night 
Like it's the last time you get no other chances 
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky 
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire

Never been here before left foot tell the right foot to go 
See the whole world coming through the door 
Footloose don't nobody care no more 
Come on go hard til the end don't quit it 
Sky to close now go'n head get it 
World's the same it's all a game 
Look at a stranger go'n change a thang 
Get up the sky go'n burn tonight 
Ye know ya'll going to learn tonight 
Feed the hungry and touch the sick 
We go'n help the homeless and love the kids 
We go'n move to a place where it's hard to live 
And folks die young and they learn to kill 
Light the sky up change your bio 
Live for something more than things you buy up 
Serve and save learn and change 
Trust in the king who can turn this thang 
Yeah they ain't every seen a shine like this 
Look up they never see the sky like this 
I'm on and this little light I got 
Imma let it shine til the day I drop 
Heart quit pumping only way I stop 
Til then I'm a light post on your block 

Treat every night like it's the last night 
Like it's the last time you get no other chances 
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky 
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire

See I don't want no regrets no turning back Imma go and impress 
Even if I lead the whole world impressed
That ain't going to put my soul to rest 
Keep the name keep the fame world to cold so I keep the flame 
Ever seen a child ain't eat for days 
Promise you ain't ever go'n leave the same 
Hands and feet cause these the meek
The world is a mess go'n sweep the streets 
Cure for cancer cure for AIDs 
Make a brother wanna stay on tour for days 
When I get home and things are wrong 
There's two shot dead right around my zone 
Ya I pray but faith is dead if I don't get up and go work my legs 
Torches high light the sky 116 no shame tonight 
Ya they ain't ever seen a shine like this 
Look up ain't ever see the sky like this 
I'm on and this little light I got 
Imma let it shine til the day I drop 
Heart quit pumping only way I stop 
Til then I'm a light post on your block

Treat every night like it's the last night 
Like it's the last time you get no other chances 
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky 
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever

Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
