[Hook:]
Go Hard or Go Home [x2]
Lord Use Me Up [x2]

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Lord kill me If I don't preach the gospel
I'm still in my 20's- but I'll die if I got to
Already dead- so forget my flesh
I done been crossed over see the full court press
I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me

Running from my trials thinkin everythangs groovy
If the Cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no mo

If I ain't seeing Christ potna I don't wanna see no mo
Rep every day withouth worrying about bruising
I been to china mayne I seen some real persecution
If U didn't know em would ya life look the same
Can they tell you value Jesus by the way you rep his name?
Man what's the point of living if I'm living for myself
Lord empty out my life before I put you on the shelf So for God I got Hard I don't' wanna die tonight
It's too many people living who ain't heard about my Christ
Go Hard or Go Home [x2]
Lord Use Me Up [x2]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Went to Asia had to duck and hide-for Sharin my faith
They tell me water it downwhen I get back to states
They say tone the music down you might sell a lot a records
But it's people out here dying and none of em heard the message
Took my wifey on mission trip - central america
Shared her testimony 40 people stood and stared at her
When she said Jesus shoulda seen it was insane cause 40 out of 40 never heard of Jesus name
Aw mayne we ain't focused on the war we just kickin it
Worried bout our image and our space up on the internet

Take me out the game coach
I don't wanna play no mo
If can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court
Thank you for the Grace for the will and the desire
Got me
Living for your glory stead of living to retire
But I pray I'll never tire of Going hard for Messiah
I don't need no motivation You the reason I'm inspired.

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Go Hard
Go Home, Go Hard
Go Home

That's what that is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

That what That is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

Wha-What that mean?

That mean that we, should be out up in ok streets

Not just in houses with our bible's summrizing what we read

Man this ain't deep (man this ain't deep)
Why we ain't doing what we read

It's like we sleep (it's like we sleep)

But sinners sleepwalk when they sleep

So why can't we (so why can't we)
The redeemed of the LORD

Act out, what He said
And make a scene for the LORD

Action-cut, say what, like we was the director

But you better get a Grip like movie sets, and get to stepping
(Martin)
I know you done it
Da-done it, da-done-and heard it all
You was going hard for the Lord before you heard this song

But don't play yourself to save ya self
And walk in fear

Scripture's like a mirror
The truth is closer than it appears
