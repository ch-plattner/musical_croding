[Verse 1] 
I'm feelin good, forget my feeling tho 
Let's talk about my fillin, filled with tha Holy Ghost 
And I ain't talkin smoke, I'm talkin fire 
I'm tryna shock the world, before they cut my wires 
I'm on that overdose, old me comatose 
See him let me know cause if you did you probably seen a ghost 
Fire in my bones, I'm spittin flames 
Boy that Word of God get at you like a Twitter name 
Truth up in my veins, everyday I need it 
But you don't hear me tho, you used to different speakers 
They speak death and they stories ain't at all the truth, 
They like to think they ballers, they just some foul shooters, 
I'm so real 100 percent authentic 
I know how fake feel i dropped him off at the clinic 
Told em he need rehabilitation "gone take him" get him clean 
Met that Triune Light "what's that?" triple beam 

[Chorus] 
Gone check him in, before they close the door 
You got that Rehab, this is the overdose 
I'm on that overdose, I'm on that overdose 
I'm on that overdose, old me "comatose" 

[Verse 2] 
They think I'm churchy, they think ya boy a lame 
Yeah I live for Jesus, I'm unashamed 
They talkin reckless what you 'spectin from the walkin dead 
You try to give em life, they want that death instead 
But 1st John make it clear what they wanna hear 
Hear go that overdose, go stick it in they ear 
I got my prescription, it's all consuming 
Eat His Flesh drink His Blood, Holy Communion 
I know the Truth is hitting home like Barry Bonds 
Yeah my God run the streets like a marathon 
Yes! I'ma believer Yes! I rep the Kingdom 
They ask me where to find the Lord they ain't never seen Him 
Homie God ain't got no longitude or latitude 
Aye gone check him in, before they close the door 
You got that Rehab, this is the overdose 

[Chorus] 
Gone check him in, before they close the door 
You got that Rehab, this is the overdose 
I'm on that overdose, I'm on that overdose 
I'm on that overdose, old me "comatose"
