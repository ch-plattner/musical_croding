[J-Paul:]
I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like,
I just gotta be like you

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Dear, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky,
Before the Lord get me I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wasn't with me shoot,
I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure
You
Stepped in at the right time,
It's 'cause of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through,
Teach me to do the things that men do
True,
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn't have seen,
But you had barely made it out your teens,
And took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you,
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care if people didn't like you,
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, pyru
You would've died, I would've died too,
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops,
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who's right behind you,
I got a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it's something deep inside you,
That tell you it's gotta be more than doing what other guys do,
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn't surprise you,
You realize you, you realize you, you,
Yeah, I just wanna be like you

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to,
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like,
I just gotta be like you

[Verse 2:]
Now all I see is money, cars, jewels,
Stars
Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars,
Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain't living and they lied well,
Guess I married an old wives' tale
Wow, fail
I don't know another way to go,
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval 'cause I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go,
And get that verbal affirmation on know how to treat a woman,
Know how to fix an engine,
That keep the car running
So now I'm looking at the media and I'm following what they feed me,
Rap stars, trap stars,
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me,
They say I'm good at bad things at least they proud of me

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like,
I just gotta be like you
(Like you)

[Verse 3:]
I was created by God but I ain't wanna be like Him,
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being,
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he shouldn't have eaten
And now look at us all out of Eden,
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make believing
But God sees through my foolish pride,
And how I'm weak like Adam another victim of Lucifer's lies
But then in steps Jesus,
All men were created to lead but we needed somebody to lead us
More than a teacher,
But somebody to buy us back from the darkness,
You can say He redeemed us,
Taught us that real leaders follow God,
Finish the work 'cause we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life love a wife like He loved the Church,
Without seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way,
So if I gotta die every day
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most of me
'Cause being just like you is what I'm supposed to be
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I made a mess but you say you'll erase it,
I'll take it
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it,
I'll take it.

(I just gotta be like, be like, be like..
Be like, be like, I just gotta be like, be like..
I just gotta be like you...)
