We can live it
We can live it, that good life
Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life

What he need God for? He got money to the Heavens
Never pulled a 187, but he preach it like a reverend
Never satisfied with second
Except for second home, second car, second woman his own, second bottle from the bar
Good life, even though he got it, he don't get it
'Cause he livin' for the moment, but this moment has an endin'
Matter fact it's been a minute, all he see is pretty women
Big lights big names, in a minute that'll change... BANG!
Caught up in an all-consuming flame
All alone, still rejecting Jesus' Name
Even if he could change he would never do it
Grandma told him 'bout the living water, he prefer the sewage
He don't know why he do it, desired just enslave him
Addicted to himself, do whatever just to praise him
Give himself the money, pleasure and treasure that'll rust
When he traded his eternity for 20 years of lust

Where the bottle go pop, models go shop
Everyone knows who you are
But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off
You see it all was false
But that's the good life
Lights, camera, action
Where is the satisfaction?
Good life...
Black diamonds and gold
Livin' highest when you live on the low

I take the narrow route, that speedway's a monsta
It's all good, I go to sleep without a guilty conscience
For that they call me conscious, but I'm very conscious
Of what I'm missin', I ain't trippin' on the girls in VIP
Frontin' for each otehr
They actin' like they somethin' that they not, they undercover
Tryin' to get under covers, but one day they'll discover
They gave parts of theyself away that they'll never recover
A part time lover took a fulltime pay
God please show her mercy, her affliction's here to stay
She just found out she pregnant and the child has been infected (my Lord)
What's worse thah that, she'll never meet the guy that she rejeceted
The one that can protect her, comfort her to the grave
And resurrect her body to live with Jesus who saves
Can't say that God ain't love her, she wanted to be a slave
This is a crew master leavin' 'em full of pain

Where the bottle go pop, models go shop
Everyone knows who you are
But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off
You see it all was false
But that's the good life
Lights, camera, action
Where is the satisfaction?
Good life...
Black diamonds and gold
Livin' highest when you live on the low

50 years from now, he may be full of gray hair, beard long
And even closer to a home that he's never known
Right now his home facin' 25-to life
Sittin' in the county jail, court appointed lawyer like
If this case is Tina Turner, homie, I am not like
Got his momma cryin' daily but she prayin' every night
Only 20 but there's plenty that he's payin' with his rights
Thought he got a life sentence but he really got life
He done read that bible twice
Been in plenty fights, sleepless nights
But when he trusted Christ you could see that change overnight
Knew he'd die in prison but was livin' for another life
Everytime his lights out he closer to the other side
Partners on the outside think he found religion as a
Coping mechanism when he say the Lord's risen
Now he lay awake in prison prayin' for his homies in the streets
'Cause truth is, he's free-er than they gon' ever be

Where the bottle go pop, models go shop
Everyone knows who you are
But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off
You see it all was false
But that's the good life
Lights, camera, action
Where is the satisfaction?
Good life...
Black diamonds and gold
Livin' highest when you live on the low

We can live it, that good life
Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life
