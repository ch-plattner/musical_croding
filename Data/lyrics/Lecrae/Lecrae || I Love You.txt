Yeah, sometimes we get so addicted to self that, you don't realize you hurting other people, specially the people you care the most about.

[Hook:]
Girl I love ya cross my heart and I hope to live to make you smile,
Cause I don't deserve you. So for all the times you held me down,
Listen to me now, ﻿ I love you girl.

Ya know I had to do a love song
To let the whole world know bout my love jones,
Love sticks is what I told the docter,
We could be more like Sho Baraka,
But we all moors and we been that
And when I said I do, I meant that
It's trip that, you let me lead you﻿
Cause I'm a mess and sometimes I need you
And I need you, to understand
That I'm dying everything tryin to be a better man,

I put that on my momma,
I love the way you play your part through my drama
Long nights, long flights, trips outta town
Ya keep my head up when it was hanging down
Down like four flats on a﻿ lack
I let you down and you still keep coming back

[Hook:]
Girl I love ya cross my heart and I hope to live to make you smile,
Cause I don't deserve you. So for all the times you held me down,
Listen to me now, I love you girl.

Out here﻿ trying to save the world,
Can't forget about my baby girl
And baby girl, you so tight it's true to me sometimes I wonder why you fool with me
Cause foolishly I'm prone to hurt you,
Call you grace cause I don't deserve you
I recall cold nights, no lights, low dough nights
You ain't fussin you was there the whole night sayin it's alright,

So faithful, Far as beef yeah we done had a plateful
But we ate it up and we made it up
Cause our view of the Lord wasn't great enough
No divorce cause what God brought together,
We will never tear apart, gonna fight and never let up.
And when I get up I'm back down on my knees,
Thank God﻿ my rib's the best part of me.

[Hook:]
Girl I love ya cross my heart and I hope to live to make you smile,
Cause I don't deserve you. So for all the times you held me down,
Listen to me now, ﻿ I love you girl.

All the fellas out there﻿ in the world
If your lady love God and you gotta good girl
Stay with her, pray with her, take her on a date
Tell her you appreciate...

How she love me, how she cares
And how shes every woman every where,
And baby I'm sorry for all the days I let you down
But I got﻿ something to say, I love you girl
