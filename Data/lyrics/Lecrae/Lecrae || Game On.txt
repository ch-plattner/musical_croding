Ya gotcha boy right, right, right [2x]

Yea, it's game on game-time
You can feel the rhythm when you listen to the rhyme
See you in the middle lookin like you ain't alive
Follow me I promise that what I got will get you right
Man, I'm crazy loco, so unashamed better check the logo
116 till the day I go bro, in everything Christ and ya hopes a nogo
Oh, now back to the topic
My game on 8 ball corner pocket
I feel flier than a bird in a cockpit
Cuz Christ saved me from ending up a hot mess
Yes, stay close to the game 
You ain't got game, ya doin ya own thang
If you don't see a dime for reppin the lords name, ya still make a whole lotta change

Work it out then [8x]

Ok they say cool I'm down wit it
Wassup get crunk gon ride wit it
Man I hope you get the picture gon smile wit it
Sins bound to gimme trouble for the trials in it
No strings attached hey who's the violinist
I was goin nowhere fast looks like my tires spinnin
I was destined to crash but then messiah in it
And he took the lords wrath my entire sentence
Come on!
This is somethin worth my action man he bought his satisfaction there was nothin I could do to get right
Come on!
Man he showed us our compassion's only worship like tofannagan baby now get your hands to the sky
Come on!

Work it out then [8x]

Ya gotcha boy right, right, right [4x]
Jus-ti-fied I'm Jus-ti-fied yowww

Even though I'm so filthy
Lost and I'm guilty
And I know I ain't worthy
But he paid it for me

Even though I'm so filthy
Lost and I'm guilty
And I know I ain't worthy
Jesus paid it for me

Work it out then [8x]
Ya gotcha boy right, right, right [2x]
