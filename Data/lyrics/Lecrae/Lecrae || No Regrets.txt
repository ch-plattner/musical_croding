[Verse 1:]
(And they say) You only live once so live it up tonight
I hope we live twice cause I can't wait to give up this life
Don't get me wrong I love my fam and my experience
Been around the world and back seven wonders I done seen 'em
Number eight is just us wonderin what happens when we perish
And I don't want no regrets I'm a tell the ones I cherish
That I love 'em thinking of 'em on this red eye flight to Paris
If I die before I wake at my wake please tell my parents
That your son will positively wake in paradise
Life is like a pair of dice so watch the ones you rollin with
Roll the clip of my life you gon' see a bunch of empty bottles
Broken hearts and blurry nights, Facebook likes and twitter follows
I'm not livin for today cause tomorrows looking pleasant
And the future is a gift even though this is the present
Yea I do believe in heaven but my actions ain't the key
Them gates remain locked if everything follow me

[Hook:]
So let em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
And I die with no regrets

[Verse 2:]
You not a leader cause they follow you on twitter
And you not a man based up on your age and your gender
If you die tonight you'll probably die a boy
Chasing toys objectifying these women thinkin they gon' bring you joy
Don't you want more than last night's braggin rights
What's yo life?
I know it's hard to think about underneath these flashing lights
Scratch the surface money's worthless when it comes to finding purpose
If you keep the end in focus you can't keep it when it's over
And when it's over there's something else starts
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart
What you trusting in what you lusting in
For that busty momma that's strutting in
And you popping bottles you throwing dollars
That's cool but partner this just in
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Some of us gon' end up holy some of us gon' end up hot
Tell this life to keep my problems kiss my momma when I'm gone
Tell her I have no regrets and I'm home I'm home

[Hook:]
So let em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
And I die with no regrets
