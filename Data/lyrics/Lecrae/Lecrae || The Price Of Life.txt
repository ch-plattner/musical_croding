
Yeah, fake hair, fake nails, fake pearls
Call herself a Barbie, wanna be a fake girl
She can't even see, she Stevie Wonder at night time
Too busy trying to get them red bottoms the right size
Tell her that you love her and she gonna call you a liar
(Whatever, you don't really love me, you just wanna give me the lie)
On the bet, but the fact is she deals with fools,
That see women as garden tools, never treated them cool
She said that suckers and brothers always makin' her sick
So she gave up on em now she's just attracted to chicks
But she never seen a man with a soul as clean
He fightin' to be whatever God made him be
Don't want to manipulate the date, the legger, or shake her
Wanna give his life to her followin' his creator
Maybe she gonna see he ain't crazy and start wondering
"God, what's the reason you made me? "
Maybe it ain't to be physically attractive just so you can trap and capture
A man, that'd be superficially happy. Nah, you're worth more than that, yeah.

Beautiful lies, yeah, I know they ain't right
But I bought it, but that's the price of life

Yeah, look
I wanted the girl that was super official
I found my standard superficial
'Cause behind the glamour was some super issues
And I ain't trying to shoot to diss you, I'm just sayin'
Everybody gotta look fly on the planes
And you don't wanna step outside, lookin' plain
They call it running game, everybody playn'
Dang, that's trinity the word 'play'
Sephora made you make up your mind
Coach bags made you feel first class this whole time
And them Nikey kicks running your life,
Your ambition been driven by them cars that you like
I know some girls that's faster than T3ch Nine
Self esteem as low as they neck-line
'Cause they don't know whose image they reflect, went to bed to find love, woke up with rats

This is a matter of heart, kid
Gimme a second, let me show you
If you own something you can't depart with
You probably don't own it, it own you
Man, tell me what's the price of life
Too much to find peace, so what's your release
Yeah, there's much more, believe me
Than living for the things that your leaving

Beautiful lies, I know they ain't right, but I bought it
But that's the price of life.

She camouflage her insecurity in Jimmy Choo's
High heels but the mountain's top she'll never choose
She'll set up for a dude & precious medals
A slave to his money by his chains you can tell it
Page to embellish the life that you really live
Them nice clothes cover up, how you really feel
When your eye liner off and you've been revealed
Trapped in a prison with multiple life sentences
55 life times as infinity, you don't wanna pray your middle fingers to Divinity
You ever stop and think about what the incentive is
Livin for their approval has got it's benefits
They special 'cause they don't live like you
But they die and their blood bleeds red like you
Truth is they depressed, takin' meds like you
They ain't livin' it up, they're dead like you

But you can live, uh
If you know the price of life
