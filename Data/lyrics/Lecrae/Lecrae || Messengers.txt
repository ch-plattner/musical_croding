[Hook - For King & Country:]
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Can you hear it?

[x4:]
Oh, oh
Ohh, oh
Hey

[Verse 1 - Lecrae:]
Yeah, yeah
We've been given a call
Been forgiven, risen
We livin' to give him our all
Rise up from your past
It's holding you down
This moment is all that matters
The future is now
How will the people know if we don't tell 'em?
If we fail 'em
They stumbling in the dark
But the light is what we carry
Yea, don't have to wonder your purpose,
Or what you here for
Reflect his image
And show the world what he cares for

[Bridge:]
And I know it's al-right, right, right
And you know, and you know it's your life, life, life
And we know, and we know that time's running out
Can't wait around 'cause
The time is now
Yeah

[Hook]

[x4:]
Oh, oh
Ohh, oh
Hey

[Verse 2 - Lecrae:]
I've been a lot of places where the scene ain't pretty
I've seen plenty of hatred death and destruction
Where ignorance kills many
The blind leading the blind
We turning a blind eye
That alone is a crime
We got the power of life
I know that we make mistakes
Don't let 'em keep you away
Mercy love and His grace
Is the reason we move ahead
Speak out
Though we never been qualified to do it
I ain't earned it
I was loved into it
I'm brand new - yea

[Bridge]
