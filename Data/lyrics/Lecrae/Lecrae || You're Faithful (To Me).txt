Right now I wanna say how much you've changed my ways, when I look back on yesterday. It's been a long journey, for the lessons I'm still learning but I can't forget the difference you made.
I could have been sleeping in my grave, but you reached down from heaven and made a way, it's so amazing how you changed my fait and all I can say is...

You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 
You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 

The world makes promises that it can't really keep, it'll always let you down. It's only temporary, only preliminary but your love, it reaches all bounds.
I could have been sleeping in my grave, but you reached down from heaven and made a way, it's so amazing how you changed my fait and all I can say is...

You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 
You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 

You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 
You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 

I don't know why, You've been so faithful to me and so I'll just trust, that you'll lead me in the right way...

You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 
You're faithful, to me, even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm, grateful to thee coz you kept me in perfect peace and it's more than I could ask for. 

Faithful, coz you've been so faithful, coz you've been so faithful, coz you've been so faithful.
Faithful to forgive me, faithful to keep me in all my ways all of my days,
Faithful, faithful, faithful, oh...
