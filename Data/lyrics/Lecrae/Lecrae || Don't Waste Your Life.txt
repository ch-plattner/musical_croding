[Hook — Cam:]
Don't wanna waste my life

[Verse 1 — LeCrae:]
I know a lot of people out there scared they're gone die
A couple of them thinking they'll be livin' in the sky
But while I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why, what am here fo' I gotta figure out
Waste my life
No I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 12: 15 down to 21
You've really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we've wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' to show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of any women and men that you admire
It ain't no lie

We're created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and he raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him
Resurrects Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my life
Then I lost my rights
I lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that would cost that price.

[Verse 2 — Dwayne Tryumph:]
Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can't hang with us
Christian youth them will stand with us
Living and driven
Given a vision
Fulfilling the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles
The rap evangelist
My daddy wouldn't abandon us
I gotta backpack full of tracts and I keep it on the Johnny mac
So are you ready to jam with us
So let's go, give me the word an let's go
Persecution let's go
Tribulation let's go
Across the nation let's go
Procrastination let's go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows how many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in to get them

[Verse 3 — LeCrae:]
Suffer?
Yeah, do it for Christ!
You're trying to figure what to do with your life
If you make a lot of money hope you're doing it right
Because the money is God's you better steward it right
And stay focused
You ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The color your skin naw you're a Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money start living for a car
Get 'em a wife a house kids and a dog
Then they retire they're living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in a mall
Your money your singleness marriage talent your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is Divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around Him He's the life in my lines
I refuse to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time
'Cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights.
