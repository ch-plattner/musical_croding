[Intro:]
I have a collect call from [beep]
Kendrick
At County detention facility
If you would like to accept this call
Please press 4

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Look I don't know what Cornel West know
I'm tryin my best though
And I don't know what all you went to
But look at everything we been through
Man, we got high together
Went to the mall, got fly together
Police came through tryna ask us questions
Me and you sat there and lied together
Tryna keep in touch, it got hard
Had a couple kids, and found God
Probably heard I went off to school
But never knew I was snortin that raw
Well I'm past that but not perfect
I know it feel like it ain't worth it
But you love dog and that's real talk
Don't nobody wanna put you in the dirt man
I know it's hard out here to get work
Got 2 strikes and feel worthless
But you was made for more than that drink and smoking
Tryna ask the streets for your purpose
You got your family here hurtin'
My partnas callin' me, worried
And me and yo daddy did the same thing
Both left us out here struggling
Heard they locked you up so I came through
Forget what you did and what you ain't do
It's times like this we pray through
Gotta run to the God that made you
Gotta hang on, hold strong
Trust in The Truth to bring you home
I ain't tryna sit here and preach to you
I'm tryna be the one you can lean on

[Dialogue 1:]
[Lecrae:] Whassup with it kinfolk?
[Friend:] Tryin' to take it one day at a time
[Lecrae:] So, whassup with the case tho?
[Friend:]
They tryin' to hit me with that mandatory minimum, man
Gotta fight that charge

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Talk with the homie through a glass wall
Letters gettin' past off
Told me he was about to head to trial
Pray to God he don't get cast off
Head to the sky cause I need some hope
Kinfolk just got caught with dope
Partner just called said his baby sick
And this might be the end of my rope
Man it's hard out here and I'm hurtin
Don't need no choir girl flirtin
Don't need no pastor tryna touch on kids
Telling me what I can't wear to church and
No fake cryin, a preacher lyin
Sayin God don't love me if I don't tithe
I need real Him in a real season
I need real faith in a real Jesus
I'm hanging on by a thread though
Crazy thoughts in my head, bro
Told my grandma to pray for me
Before I end up dead or on death row
Only few of my friends know
What I got to pretend for
Free fallin, tryna hang on it
Anything I can get my hands on
Hang on

[Dialogue 2:]
[Grandma:] Hello
[Lecrae:] Hey Grandma. It's me
[Grandma:] Hey baby!
[Lecrae:] Hey, I need you to pray for me. I'm just going through some things right now
[Grandma:] Well, what's going on?
[Lecrae:] Well, you know, just everything. Family, money, just life in general. It's crazy
[Grandma:] 
Well, let me tell you what the good Lord say, He said don't be anxious about yo' life. What you gon' eat or what you gon' drink or about yo' body. See, life is more than food, and the body is more than for clothing. Birds in the sky, they don't sow, they don't reap, but yo' heavenly Father feeds ya'. So, He say just seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to ya'. See, life ain't for you to control, carry all the burdens. That's why ya' give ya' life to Him. Hang on
