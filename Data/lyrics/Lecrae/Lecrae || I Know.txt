[Verse:]
Boy, I lost and I'm foolish
Runnin off with at the two lips
Prolly wooin all the cruelest persecute us to fool us
Catch me hangin with shooters
Rumored to shrew yo' medulla
My momma told me they would screwups but I already knew it
Who go'n give 'em peace of mind
They can have piece of mine
No they thinkin I'm blind
But I just pay them no mind
Yeah I know they be lyin
They misquotin my lines
They like "What you think you doin puttin hope in yo' rhymes?"
You would think I'm shootin folk or puttin coke in my rhymes
I just give 'em bass for free and push the dopest of lines
Boy you trippin, I know
Cr-Cr-Crae you slippin, I know
I done heard this all before; just sit back enjoy the show
Yeah, I know they go'n hate us
Type they blog up, debate us
They be fishin for attention but don't know how to bait us
Keep that hate on Hiatus
Big ups to my Creator
No big bang just a banger
So tell that DJ to bang it! Yeah!

[Hook:]
I know [x8]
I know what they sayin, but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin, but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin
I ain't trippin on it mayne
I just came to do my thing
Somethin different for a change

[Verse:]
Listen I-K N-O
They tryin to find out my M.O.
I tell 'em God sent me they prolly ain't get the memo, I know
I can say that cause Jesus walks
They don't play that, I know
Shouldn't be up here cause people rollin they trees here, I know
You can't help 'em
No strippers and killers welcome, I know
You can't hear it
No ignorance in my lyrics
Boy they swear I went loco
116 still my logo
Catch us rollin in that Volvo
Go'n snap you a photo
Maybe Andy or PRo though
Might see Trip in De Soto
Maybe KB, maybe T-Dot
Yeah I know you don't know though
Yeah I know they don't like me
Cause I be on my Spike Lee
Even when I do the right thing, they still wanna fight me
IRS want they taxes
Police stop us in traffic
Plus my girl be on my back
She say my life is too hectic
'Crae they watchin, I know
Aye they talkin, I know
I done seen this all before
Man, it's just part of the show
Let's go!

[Hook:]
I know [x8]
I know what they sayin, but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin, but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin
I ain't trippin on it mayne
I just came to do my thing
Somethin different for a change
I know [x8]
I know
