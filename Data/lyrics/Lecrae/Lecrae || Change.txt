You done had it with this, if broke is a habit I guess you back at it again
You need a change

Man you need some answers cause you just lost your moms to cancer
You really need a

You done tried almost all the drugs
And from Vegas to NY you been to all the clubs. You wanna change
You tried new shoes and clothes
But after while you still low so you know you gotta change
Maybe if you could get a new you or new crew, a new do, that would suit your change
.A new somebody to lay with
Cause the last 5 just ain't make it they all betta change
A brand new car on sixes the one you got now needs fixing and plus an oil change
You tried a new place
New clothes, new tastes
New ways, new face but you still need a change

You don't really know what you were put here for but before you go
You looking for a change
You trying find a home you can call your own cause you way too grown to making that chump change
Life's too short you been down to long

Now you got oprah on thinking maybe she can help you out your hopeless zone
She gone change you
You even tried the church the pastor gave you bunch of rules they ain't seem to work
You don't change
You tried another one tho that gotcha feeling good inside and gotcha runnin fa mo and mo change
But all about you not God not truth
Just because you wear the suit don't mean you been changed
Christ is just a means to money, plus health
Your like the master and hes the dummy
No change

Well if not that... then maybe it's better to be confused and forget all facts and all change
Still been chasing change, and look where it gotchu depressed ain't a thang not u ain't making no...
You tried to find God
The horoscopes and stars
Ain't get very far
So far no change
What if life ain't supposed to be gravy, fulla hurt pain, death, rape, murder and craziness
If God made everything Good then you still gotta live in the hood what's really good
It goes back to Adam in Eden when he ate that fruit believin somehow that he could
Man disobeys God now both are at odds
And life is just hard cause our hearts need
You can't find hope in cars
Hope in money, or people
Only hope in God he can change you
Jesus felt the pain, he was hated, hurt, slandered and slain his death brought
Be a slave to your sin, hate God love money, love lies, Christ died so you can be changed
It's kinda fun for a while but you'll lose that smile
When your lights go out
And the pain won't change
