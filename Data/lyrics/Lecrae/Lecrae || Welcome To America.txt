[Intro:]
Ladies and gentlemen
Good afternoon from the flight deck
Were cruising at 37,000 ft and we just passed over the coast
We will be beginning our descent in about a 30 minutes
Like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

[Verse 1:]
Uh, I was made in America land of the free, home of the brave
And right up under your nose you might see a sex slave being traded
And will do anything for the money
Boy, a mamma might sell her babies
Sell porn, sell pills, anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch
Gotta scratch them ticks
Ain’t rich but I might be
And I'mma shoot these flicks
I'mma turn these tricks
Anything for a slight fee
Yeah, made in America
Mamma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes
Had to learn our rights
Had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kind of doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack

I was born in the mainland
Great-grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave here
But I was made in America
So I don’t know a thing about that
All I know is Uncle Sam looking for me, working on his corner so I know I gotta pay tax

Getting paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If I’m wrong then you better come save me America

[Hook:]
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa [4x]
Welcome to America [5x]

[Verse 2:]
Man, I’d die for America
I served my time for America
Got shot, shot back, went to war, got back and ain’t nobody give a jack in America
I could've lost my life, boy, I lost my wife
I can’t even get right in my home land
Cold sweats, hold tecs, paranoid looking out for a threat in my own land

I was trained in America
How'd they get up in them planes in America?
Flew them right into the buildings
Taking out civilians
People getting killed in America?

And I’m still in America
Though America ain’t feeling me
I went to war for this Country
Turned around came home and you drillin' me?
When y’all free here saying you don’t wanna be here
Well, you probably could breathe here
If I didn’t load a couple magazines here
Y’all just complain in America
I’m jumping out of military planes from America
Aye I was made in America
That's why I’m out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted y’all safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear about face!
We bled for America
To keep y’all fed in America
But whats the point of talking a lot of y’all don’t really even care America

[Hook:]
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Welcome to America [5x]
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

[Verse 3:]
Uh, I wish I lived in America
Wanna raise my kids in America
Heard everybody rich all I gotta do is run, jump, kick
I'm a hit in your area
So please pick me, America
I know you'll probably never love me
You never hear about me on the news
And you’ve probably never been to my Country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I can tell cause a lot of y’all are overweight
I already work for y’all
I’m in the sweatshops making these shirts for y’all
Now I ain’t getting money, go to bed hungry
But I make some exports for y’all

And y’all don’t know a thing about that
You was made in America
I’m trying to find me a ticket
Where the sky is the limit catch a plane to America
It should be plain to America
Y’all blessed and you got it made
Heard y’all don’t pray no more
Y’all ain’t saved no more
Y’all looking for another way
Well, I hope it ain’t true
But I’m packing my suit
Farewell to my motherland
Said bye to my loved ones
Fate here I come, I’m going to another land

I done made it to America
I’m amazed at America
But I couldn’t get approval to stay so they sent me away from America
