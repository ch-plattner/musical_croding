Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy [x2]
Lord have mercy and pity on your son

Dark Past full of evil endeavors
Heart clean never black and ugly as ever
However I seen my family die from them rocks
Them beams on blocks including my own pops
Homie I seen two much to drink them two cups
Can’t lean on the lean already way too screwed up
Was way to gone I was way to cold
Fifty yard hail mary I was way to thrown
I was Tarzan raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees when I gorilla’d the beast
Then that truth came hit me got me outta my grave
All my partners say I'm changed
How am I go’n stay the same huh?!

Killer tryna murder it chasing ladies down for fun
Saying come with me hail mary but then kill the son
However I seen them boys mane take that bar and wait for God’s sake
Beastie boy he still took three the hard way
Toss me out heart away crucifix no jewelry
Just wooden beams he took from me
Took 'em up to Calvary while I was a DGK
Wiling out to UGK runnin from the HPD
Huffin puffin mary jane no grip chains mane
I was looking for a super freak
Nasty cameo candy super sweet
But now your boy turnt up free from all them chains
Ya volume on ten you can call it unashamed

Now I'm turnt up daily I'm on my one-eighty
They thought I'd water down I'm like boy y'all crazy
On my J.O. my Oj Mayo I'm on my Grizzly
Jesus turned me around me so fast that you would swear I was dizzy
Now they askin who is he now they wonderin my name
I run in my own lane screaming Jesus is King
Til my heart stop pumpin no more blood in my veins
Watch me turn up everyday homeboy I'm so unashamed

[Tedashii:]
Turnt up boy turnt up boy
Turnt up boy turnt up
