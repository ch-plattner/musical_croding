
Let me tell 'bout my homeboy Cory
this is the first verse of the very first story 
call it the first letter
you can call it whatever
long as you hear the truth and leave surer than ever
Cory's a new believer actin' like he's in gang
he run around sayin his Church is the greatest thang
He won't check a sermon unless its his Bishops name,
It seems he forgot to keep Jesus the main thang
Cause Bishop ain't raise up after three days up
he ain't take ya case up
offering you his grace huh
But Cory stay divided all the time
not Christ but a man that he standin behind

I got this little letter, I'm tryna break down (break it down)
So you can hear the Truth in the Sound (In the Sound) Division,
A whole lotta Sin I can't forget the problems of people living within. [X2]

I got this little letter I'm tryna break down
(break it down)
But let me tell you Cory background
he started off crazy, parties, full shawties religious ceremonies where people was gettin naughty
but all that changed
the truth of God reigned
The Gospel spread within Him, like viruses in his veins 
but man even though his heart's rearranged
he found himself caught up in some of his old ways
he layin up with women his sinning was gettin strange
he thought the more he sinned the more Jesus was pleased to save
He thought cause he accepted His brother touchin his mother 
that he was spiritual cause he let'em get with each other
Cory had beef with another within the faith instead workin' through it they opened a court case
a slap to the face of the God who gives grace
Cory's outta place tryna carry his own weight

I got this little letter, I'm tryna break down (break it down)
So you can hear the Truth in the Sound (In the Sound) Division,
A whole lotta Sin I can't forget the problems of people living within. [X2]

Now Cory got married but everywhere he turns
he sees lust burn and women waitin' to serve him
yeah an Cory's learnin
satan wishes to turn him away from his wife to satisfy all his yearnings
Divorce ain't legitimate
if both are regenerate
what God put together let nobody put a split in it
but see that ain't the end of it
He sought his own benefit
He would do things that his friends saw as forbidden
and though it was no sin in it
His homies they was ignorant and they were made weak cause His liberty was their hinderance

Unlike an apostle no concern for the Gospel
no denying his rights nah homie wasn't that thoughtful...thoughtful
Maybe I should take a second to explain man that Cory ain't a person but a group of people.
Many just like Christians today - caught up in their own worldly culture no respect for divine authority, the Lords Supper,
and still exhalting gifts which are all given by the Holy Spirit.
They begin to value these things more than love for one another.
Everything we have is given by God who commands us to live outwardly toward others.
I pray none of us wrestle with the Resurrection of Jesus. Holla at me if you do.
Above all things LOVE GOD and LOVE ONE ANOTHER!
