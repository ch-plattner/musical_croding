Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Ya'll gon get me bowed up
When that beat hit it's like three kicks
And your knees up to your nose, huh
You knows us
Unashamed, Uno Uno Seis, whoa
Tatted on my skin, all up in your face, whoa
If I ain't bout that live, then I ain't really livin
But if you can't see my light then maybe I ain't in it
Champagne, champagne, celebratin my campaign
I just dug a well in West Africa
But how many of my friends is African, huh?
No habla español, just show me tu baño
Ain't trynna get to know you, I'm too busy readin Daniel
Most segregated time of day is Sunday service
Now what you think that say about the God you worship?
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon last more than one day
What you thought, huh?
Faith ain't bout no soft stuff
I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up

[Hook:]
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Ain't no filters in this town, dirty water

Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that
My family came here on slave ships
Some herd cattle, some herd blacks
Know some of ya'll done heard that
My kin was treated less than men
That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize
I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by
They must be whores cuz the master rapes them and leaves
The child
So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'
Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings
You call him devil, he fightin for self esteem
It's hard to dream when your water ain't clean
Now look at Lucifer's scheme as how to be in a team
Blood in the ocean to these African streams
This dirty water ain't nothin we haven't seen

[Hook]
