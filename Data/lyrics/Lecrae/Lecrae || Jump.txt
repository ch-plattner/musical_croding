[Verse 1:]
It's the assurance of things hoped for. Noah built a boat for
Jesus took a beatin and his whole body was broke for.
Spoke for. Through it we know who the Word was wrote for.
Abraham had it, matter fact that's what he's known for.
Faith, ya'll, through it we were saved by grace
If you got it, we can see it by the way you run the races
That means we can see it on your face
If the faith don't act, then it really ain't faith
And that really ain't the case cause faith ain't fake
It'll have you try'na act out the Word everyday
Every Christian has faith, it's a gift; we should use it
Some distort the veiw of it and others just abuse it
It can be irrational and make you give your life up
This is for the cause of Christ and not to get a nice truck
Righteous, when you know you gotta trust God
When it seems hard, man, faith is a must have.

[Chorus:]
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
Take a leap of faith
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
Come on jump for now
Jump for me now
Jump jump
Jump for me now
Jump for me now

[Verse 2:]
Before you heard "Breath In", "Represent! Get Krunk! "
I was tested in my faith, and I didn't know if I could jump
I was at my 9-to-5 try'na make a couple dimes,
But somethin in my soul was sayin that I had to rhyme.
I was rappin every saturday, teachin on Sunday.
8 A.M. again I'm back to work another Monday.
Man I was hatin it, I wasn't even fakin it,
And then came opportunity, but me, I wasn't takin it.
Show after show came; a couple folks came,
But leavin work to rap was risky like the dope game.
And mama mad at me, she say that it was bad for me
To spend my time in school just to rap, what a tragedy.
Alot of free shows, but I had to pay bills.
Lord, you know I wanna go, but can you show me what you will.
I wasn't chasin rap dreams, wasn't try'na stack green.
God had my back against a wall like a flat screen.
Urgin me to trust, Lord I wanna, but I'm scared to.
Lord, I'm prepared to be broke, just to share you.
So I followed Abraham. I told the Lord to take my hand.
I took a leap of faith, and I ain't never been the same agin.

[Chorus:]
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
Take a leap of faith
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap with it!)
Come on jump for now
Jump for me now
Jump jump
Jump for me now
Jump for me now

[Chorus:]
