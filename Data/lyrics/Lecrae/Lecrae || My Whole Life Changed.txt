[Hook: Lecrae]
Let's just say I saw the light
Let's just say I heard the truth
Let's just say I ain't' the same no more
I'm out here looking new
Let's just say I left the game
Take my jersey, I retired
Let's just say I'm at the game
Put me in I'm on fire
Boy!
My whole life changed (that's when)
My whole life changed (that day)
My whole life changed (right there)
My whole life changed
My whole life changed (that's when)
My whole life changed (that day)
My whole life changed (right there)

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Alright now, stop!
Ya'll don't quite understand the story I got
I once popped a whole thing of pills in hopes that I drop
My cousin walked out a party, bow, got shot
Pow, pow, pow
Some girl lied and my partna is locked in that box
So, I'm not concerned about what they think about me
Think about it
That truth is tatted up on my heart and can't nobody get that ink up out it
I'm eatin out and they thinking now I'm gone' sell out
Maybe I feed em' now
And some folks looking like they ain't learned the foundation firm
I ain't seeking out
So, I don't need a co-sign to get this
All the things you done
I done did that
I could rap about money and cars and getting high
But, why? I let the rest of ya'll pen that
Insecurity brags and I've been that
V.I.P. with Lebron James, I'm in that
So, I don't need a hug from Hip-Hop
A right to go pop and hope that ya'll feel that
Nah
Imma talk about faith
Imma talk about Christ
Imma talk about life
Cuz' I want to
Change my life I ain't lost my sight
I been on the same things since '02
And that's real talk
That's plumline
That's UNT
My soul's rocked
And my life changed
I'm free indeed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Alright, Chill
Apparently, you can't tell the fake from the real
And these rappers getting all sensitive in my ears
Insecure whining makes it harder to hear
But uhh, that ain't here nor there
I swear I respect the kind of reject that
Wanna rebel and just reflect on real things like feelings
But these feelings are kinda suspect
Look, I came from a past so shameful
Took advantage of the girls by the handful
Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice
Telling me everything I was on was wrong
Yessir, I was on my throne
Now I hear the same thing, same thing
But I hear it in a song and they wanting me to sing along
Woah, that's trifling, for a grown man that's stifling
I was on the same path for the wrath
I just never got paid for the trash I was writing
But like lightning, that light came and struck me
My life changed, and then suddenly
I met The Lord, and it wasn't even a Sunday
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces
That's gon' rust and fade when you cease
Huh?

[Hook]
