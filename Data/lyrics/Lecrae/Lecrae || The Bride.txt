[Hook:]
Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty - She the Church
You might see her acting crazy, be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby - She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her, Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her - She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children

[Verse 1:]
A building of beings being constructed
Christ is the cornerstone, foundation build on another and you's a goner holmes
She' built on em, supported by him, conformed to him, now she's a body of bodies who transform through him
A temple that breathes we are the halls,
We are the floor board or more we are the walls
Manifold wisdom of God no longer a mystery
The church is the pinnacle of our salvific history
One flesh union homie
The Tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion
Still the present reality is she was born a casualty though she's made alive
She's affected by depravity
Once lived in sin and enslaved by her lust and
Folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted
She's a work in progress Christ is the head of her
And He wash her clean with the words that he done said to her
She's already pretty but she's really not dressed and sometimes she look silly but she's far from a mess
Yes, please so don't be dissin cause Jesus done paid grip an
And if you didn't then should caller her Misses. I'm talking bout the church

[Verse 2:]
Her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly
Bows to (the Trinity) No other Divinity
A body family and community she is all one
But on earth you see her in congregational small ones
A microcosm or a small scale example
But yes it is the church even though it's just a sample
Invisible spiritual
Physical visible
Not a brick temple never that simple
This a not a building
She is not bricks
She's a world changer but ain't bout getting rich
Perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate
Plus her hands get dirty and her feet get scraped
And sometimes her body parts start acting outa place
Legs tryna be arms
Arms thinking they the face
But she'll never be replaced with a one man band or a small Taliban with no body in command

[Verse 3:]
Some don't get it so they hate
They say she's on a paper chase they say she's really fake
So they go start a ministry so they can do the work
But they don't understand how Jesus feel about His church
And yeah they make disciples
They got plenty conversions
They take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin
But none of them are churchin
No church structure
No elders and no discipline
They don't have a conductor
And they so they don't submit
But quite a few of them baptize
People how I pray that you'd look at this thing from God's eyes
Take responsibility inside the whole council not just the area where you might have a mouthful
Who should people submit to
Who will conduct the discipline
If excommunicated what body will they be missing then
Look at Ephesians 4 where Paul gets practical
1st timothy and Titus if you thinking I'm irrational
