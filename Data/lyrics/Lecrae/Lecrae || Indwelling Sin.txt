[Sin:] Aye look what's good fam it's me again. The one you used to call your friend. I know you ain't forgot me?

[Crae:] Oh yeah you always get me caught in sin.

[Sin:] Here you go with that again. You act like we ain't cool or sumthin. Let's go smoke a Kool or sumthin. Talk and sip a brew or sumthin.

[Crae:]
Naw man I ain't trusting you
Ain't nothing but lust in you
Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching I was entrusted to
Cause when you pass by you just want ya boy to backslide
Have me feeling sick like I'm coming down off a crack high

[Sin:]
Man that's a flat lie
You act like I'm the bad guy
You know when me and you get together we have a grand time
Let's take it back. All the way to like the 6th grade
Last thing on your mind back in the day was trying to live saved
Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?
Man that was innocent fun come on...

[Crae:]
NOW don't start
See dawg I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify
All them old sinful desires that never satsify

[Sin:]
Aye come on KILL THAT!
Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie
You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk, and getting high, stacking money, staying fly, living up the playas life, we was having fun now gone try to be religious guy

[Crae:]
Aye Yo man first of all LOWER YOUR VOICE! Who you talkin' to?
Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you
Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you
I'll mess around and lose my life man tryna walk in you
I'm standing on these stages and got these people believing me
What I look like trying ta gratify this disease in me

[Sin:]
So Now I'm a disease? Man please. I got yo back dawg
I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star
All I'm saying is when it's you and me let's be real folk
We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk
Maybe just a lil...

[Crae:]
What? A lil this, a lil that, a lil BET late at night, that's like a lil crack, see you ain't gone lie to me
I see how you be tryna be
BET tonight becomes addiction to pornography
And that's in no way honoring the God who's ruling sovereignly

[Sin:] Man you know you miss them old days

[Crae:]
Yeah you right possibly
But after that I sober up and think of Jesus holding up... his skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights I'm throwing up
Every thought of blowin up is captured in his flowing blood
I start thinking Philippians 4:8 when you showing up

[Sin:] You know I ain't gone quit right?

[Crae:]
Yeah I know but I'm dead to you
And one day I'll be present with Jesus who died and bled from you
Colossians 1:15 that's the God that I trust in
The Father crushed Him
In doing so he has crushed sin
