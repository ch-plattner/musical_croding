Uh, I know it's going to kill me but I just can't let it go
And the taste so appealing got a grip upon my soul
These honey dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got it's crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again
Sipping on seduction while we eating on some secret sin
(Not a lot of love and mercy) says the whisper in my ear
And I know I should be over this, but I ain't seeing clear
And I ain't leaving here, unless somebody save me
Walking to my grave letting evilness enslave me
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fueling my fascination
While I'm intoxicated she starts her assassination
I'm losing all my honor and my years to the merciless
Giving all my life away but I'm just so immersed in this (killa)

[Hook:]
Baby this is innocent (Killa) it won't even hurt a little bit (Killa)
I'm only here for your benefit (killa) I'm your every wish (Killa)
Come on and let me in (killa), baby this is innocent (Killa)
And it won't even hurt a little bit (Killa) Close your eyes and let's get lost tonight
(Killa) Would it be alright? You'll see (killa)

Her feet go down to DEATH, so don't let her consume you
Even though her heart is black, her exterior's beautiful
She'll take your life away, strip away your joy
Pretends that she gon build you up but she's just gon destroy you
My friends fell low, when they was so high
Got me running scared of myself, no lie
And I know I'm gon die, I tried cold turkey
But when I'm feeling worthy, Satan's sure trying to merk me
I'm doing myself dirty, flirting with what's perverted
I should follow the word but I guess I'd rather be murdered
Excuse me I mean martyred 'cause I'm killing myself
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon name it death, breath
(Gasps) -Taker, she take my breath away
Replaces it with poison and I'm so swept away
I need some bread today hope I wake up
Before they start my wake up somebody make me break up
I'm dating a (Killa)
