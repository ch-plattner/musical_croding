Uhh, you I, umm,
I know I just got out of rehab, but uh,
I actually need to be checked back in. Yeah.
I didn't think this was gonna happen to me... man...

Feel like I'm back in that dark place
Somewhere in between a rock and a hard place
And I ain't doin nothin' bad, I'm just doin' bad
Feelin' empty when I got more than I done ever had
So I'ma do what I do best when I feel depressed
Go ahead and let my pen bleed out the stress
In the margins, me and wifey arguin'
I don't remember why, but basically I ain't washin' her in Ephesians 5
She get out of line, I don't show her grace
I get a pen and I trace her
Now we need an eraser

I'm like, God, give me a sermon or a verse
Anything to break the curse; I feel like it's getting worse
But it's like for every step up in the right direction
Come with two swift punches to my midsection
I get discouraged and I question is it really worth it
Maybe tryin' to change the world isn't really my purpose

I wish it wasn't true
But it is, though
Now the kids know
I'm not a hero, but I know somebody who is, though
I wish it wasn't true
But it's very true
And if it's scaring you
Look in the mirror, see my reflection instead of you

I can settle and be suburban, put down the Spurgeon
Be concerned with keepin' my home furnished
Now my fire burns only for my own advancement
Forget a passion for the pastors in Sudan
The kids in Afghanistan, who be losin' their dads
They took a stand, saying that Christ is more than a man
Man, I got the blues
I ain't got a clue how to get 'em another hue

All I wanna do is escape with a cold brew
Go to sleep and wake up and pretend that it's all cool
I wish it wasn't true
But ain't no quick fix on the wish list
Trials make you better while they make you sick, yeah
I was dyin' to try 
Now I'm dying from trying
Now I'm trying to die
To the lies I'm buying

I wish it wasn't true
But it is, though
Now the kids know
I'm not a hero, but I know somebody who is, though
I wish it wasn't true
But it's very true
And if it's scaring you
Look in the mirror, see my reflection instead of you

How come I wait till I'm downcast and gray
Before I think, Lecrae, you may wanna pray
You may wanna walk in that library
Get one of them commentaries
See what them old dudes got to say
But it's easy to push play on the YouTube video or the Vimeo
Escape from the menial, letting all these subliminal messages
Wash me, watch me as I watch these
People tell me what I can purchase just to wash these
Blues away, functional savior, I'm getting mine
It's $19.99 for a limited time
Besides, after that I'm sure that I'll be feeling fine
- Ok, I'm lying. Really I'm just dying to try.
And for the 55th time times 9
I'm disappointed looking for anything but the divine
Save me from what I'm feelin' inside, it's like a crime
How I end up in the same place every single time
