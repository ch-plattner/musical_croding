[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah back on the grind again
I know it's been a lil while but it's time again
Folks askin Crae when ya gonna rhyme again?

See a lot of thangs change some stay the same
Went from H Town to D Town to Memphis may'n
One thang that's fasho, everywhere I go
People caught up in theyself money, cars and clothes (yep)
They talk about it all the time and put it in they songs
They drive around and play it loud like it ain't nothin wrong
And all they talk about is sinful stuff,
Got everybody actin bad thinkin that they a thug (weeelll)
And they tryna drown me out, but nah they ain't gon count me out
I got a backpack full of tracks plus I keep a Johnny Mac so we can pound it out
Plus I'm bumpin dese JESUS BEATS

That stuff we bumpin ain't that lean with it rock with it (nope)
It's that change ya life and please let the rock hit it
Now that stuff that we bump bring the sound of Christ (Christ)
116 our prayer to Christ
Was once lost then found now we down with Christ
In the dark hearts stop but we found the light now it's soundin right
Suicide to the good and the phantom life cause the gospel is good
In the past I don't think ya'll understood
Now ya got it messed up let us outta ya hood
We got the windows down and when we finna cruise

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
You like music from rap to gospel
But ya prolly neva heard nobody rap the gospel
Different sound but the truth's the same
With no choirs no bands but the truth remains
We got fam and the clique set the booth on flames
St Louis others philly, like Duce and Flame
If ya lost in the flow don't lose the name
It's Jesus Christ the king of the jews my mayn
This ain't entertainment dawg it's timeless truth
Would you rather hear a song about shiny coupes, nope
Non-fat non-gat non-killa rap, 100% christ da blood spilla rap
Ya'll feelin that, rap wrapped up with the gospel, ay trip dawg run it back
Ya'll feelin that? Rap wrapped up with the gospel ay trip dawg run it back

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
If in our car you hear that boom-bep
And you hear some dude's rep
It ain't dem folks that boast, it's folks that tell you where the truth's at
We don't wanna hear about dimes and dope (nope)
We don't wanna hear about nines and smoke
We don't wanna hear about movin packs and foolish cats who lie and boast
We do wanna hear about Christ the king
Do wanna hear how lives is changed
We do wanna hear how God is pleased
And theology of the Bible mayn
This Jesus music turn heads, so turn it up and let em know
In all we do he's first and, this Jesus music's better bro (yeah)
