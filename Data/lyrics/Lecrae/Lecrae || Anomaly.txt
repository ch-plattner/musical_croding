I never fit in I was an outcast
In grade school, out blastin' my Outkast
And I'll pass on running' to catch a route pass
Give me a pen and a pad I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols, America into foreign-ers
Before the foreign cars and the boring bars
Money, money, money, sex, drugs, and the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at?
All this money but where the Bugattis at?
But dig a lil deeper and you'll find another insecure man sittin' in a two seater
The same little boy that got beat up
Plenty pains in his past you could bring up
Nobody ever told him he could be more than he is, but inside he's a leader
I didn't know who was inside me either
Striving to be the captain, hoping I can date a cheerleader
Tryna get me a throne of my own so I can put my feet up
Thank God my kingdom was overthrown by The Soul Redeemer

Yeah, anomaly
Deviation From The Common Rule
Somethin' or somebody that's abnormal,
And dosen't fit in
I say that's exactly what we are.
We are the odd,
The outcast,
The peculiar,
The Strangers.
And they say we don't fit in
But I say, we are exactly who God created us to be anomalies
The system didn't plan for this.
