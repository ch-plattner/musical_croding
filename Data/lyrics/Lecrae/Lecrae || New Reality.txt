[Verse 1:]
Dear you yeah you the person listening
Is God using me trying to get your attention, yeah
See he remembers the first day that he made you
Mouldin' your lungs full of breath that he gave you
Not too mention the day he saved you
Or when he opened your eyes by the Spirit Christ was raised through
Did I mention that he forgave you
And had his flesh ripped off for the sin you was enslaved to
Now it seems you too far gone
You want to turn back but you ain't sure if you'll be welcome home
So you figure you just leave it alone
But you're addicted to yourself
We both know you can't see it alone
This is an intervention, Jesus intervened
He intercedes on behalf of a sinner's deeds
This is an intervention because the Lord hurts
Before it gets worse stomach another verse

[Hook:]
Most times I pay no attention lose my direction all I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven your love I've been given your grace shown me lavishly
You were born on earth on the cross you died for me forgive my depravity
Lord you are my reality

[Verse 2:]
Well cold water we drink, hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothing it just sits and it looks
And that's you imagine these as the words of Christ
I remember you love me, I remember your light
You used to shine bright but now it's so dim
It used to be about us but now it's about them
You can't win playing hard games
But I love you even when your light's off in your dark shame
When you lay down and profane me
Or when your bloodstream contains the things that would defame me
When nobody knows that you claim me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and want to blame me
I still want you back, I won't punish you
I took that on the cross because I wanted you
I might discipline and chastise
But if you got what you deserved you'd be in hell with other bad guys

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You made it this far and that's a big move
But your addiction is hurtin your other friends too
Some of them miss you, some of them dissed you
But they was hurtin, strugglin to forgive you
And they hated how addiction got the best of you
Chose a lie when God promised the best for you
If you realize you livin in sin
Just confess and realize you're forgiven of sin

[Hook x2]
