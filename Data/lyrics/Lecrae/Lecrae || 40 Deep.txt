[Lecrae:]
All s-
All s-
(The boy is dangerous)
All saved, all serious
All saved, all serious
All saved, all s-
All saved, all s-
All saved, all serious

[Verse:]
Yo clicked up 40 deep in the street you can find us
Ya we on theology but we be on the grind ya
When we was a youngers only had 2 place to run to
One become an animal, two get out the jungle
So we got our lion on the line bro, that's what we do
Run up on you and your crew and tell ya'll Jesus is the truth
Open air evangelists, relationships we do it all
Backpack still full of tracks with a Johnny Mac, hats to the back and our backs to the wall
Plus I got some homies out there who gon' rep the rock
If you wanna make them stop, you gon' have to bring a choppa
If they get martyred, then we gon' go harder
Share the gospel on death row and let 'em know that they been pardoned
You don't wanna get it started, this is what we do, who we are
1-1-6 to the day we die, ain't tryin to be no superstars
Chicks to the click that'll pull your car?
Usin' the street like cops in cars?
You ain't hear the truth today, I promise we'll be back tomorrow

[Hook:]
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious
Clicked up 40 deep, hey holla at us if you curious
Clicked up 40 deep, we all saved, all serious
Clicked up 40 deep, come holla at us if you curious
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Yah)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Yah, it's community baby, haha)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Let's take it back, Creezie, let's talk about it)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Let me show you Tedashii's style, baby)

[Tedashii:]
To the streets, like Crae
Clicked up 40 deep, all day
Backpacks they strap 'em Johnny Mac and tracks to play for me this morning to label the streets, all day (okay)
1-1-6 for your boy, man this morning just some?
Clicked up in community, baby, this here the?

[Trip Lee:]
A clique of us is shining rhyming walking talking sharing Christ, very hype
Find us hiding behind him all prepared to fight, very tight
Fighting trying to share the cross. He spared of life
We're living by the blood like we're parasites, get it right
My team carries bunch of high beam blaring lights
Might seem scary but we nice, see we carry life
Light is seen clearly man we're glaring very bright
Check the fleet man we deep so we might seem Barry White
Ever since we heard about the murder how they buried Christ
Eyes upon the cross even though that is a scary sight
But that was the merger we converted now we very tight
He died for His bride homey, How you like the married life?
Christ the name we calling on
Can't wait til He calls us home
You know we be falling often we can't walk it all alone
My crews always rhyming like some stalkers we ain't stalkin homes'
Started with the cross and we continue with the cross alone
