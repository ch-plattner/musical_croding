[Hook x2:]
Lights off
Ain't nobody watching me
I heard about the man in the sky
But he probably fell asleep
Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars
But still don't know the time that sun comes down from the stars

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, they say that time waits for no man
Nah, hey probably lyin'
Cause time wait on me like a servant all of the time
But I know some people who actually serving time
Committed to this grind, or just committed some crime
Sometimes I wish some more time to think
And all the time in the world is all the time I need
And I know eternity's calling but my mind too busy racing to pay any mind
Spend a whole lot of money on a watch
Ironic cause I got it but I hardly sit and watch the time tick by
I spend time trying to buy it to own time
Never thought that I was only wasting my own time
Who holds time?
They say he'll be coming in no time
Pray I pay attention, cause I'm giving him no time
When the lights off, is anybody watching me?
Heard the man above never slumber, never sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
On the corners, in the alleys
I see coners and cowards
Scared to question their existence like ain't no final hour
Can we blame the sins of a reverend for all our irreverence?
Does my time spent on earth qualify me for heaven?
Did we tick him off by wasting all these ticks on this clock?
Or is he graciously giving me time to give him my heart?
I'm sure it's the latter, sure that it matters
And I believe I've been given all this time so I could try to redeem it
Or make the most of this stopwatch that I'm racing
You stop the watch you ain't racing
You erasing your minutes, you can't replace 'em
And at the end of your days when eternity's in your face
You'll have one life to offer up and it's service to lay to waste
So my Rollie's telling me to roll out
Make investments with my time while I'm tryna hold out
And fame, money, success be competing for my investments
But I can't take 'em with me when it's time for me to exit

[Hook]
