Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

Check me in
I know I'm sick and my addiction got me itchin'
Everyday I need a fixin'
I ain't quittin' till it kill me
Ya hear me, I like the feel but hate the taste of the product
Like the numb on the tongue when you taste narcotics
The bass gets to bumpin'
You can feel what I'm drummin'
Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go but it's something you can't grasp
Yeah, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, as the flesh wants
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
I say I'm gon' quit but I'm at it in the morn'
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
This a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin' to break through
I'm ready for Rehab, jus' do what ya gon' do

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab

(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab
