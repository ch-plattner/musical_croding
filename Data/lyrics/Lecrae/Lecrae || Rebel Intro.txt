[Prelude:]
Yeah
Just wanna dive into the beat
Swim around in it
Lets rebel

[Hook:]
Rebel, I'm in rebellion [repeated]
Yeah, to all my Rebels out there
Rebelling against the culture, being transformed
Not conformed to the ways of this world, or this age
Welcome to the Rebel-ution

[Verse 1:]
Jesus was a rebel, a renegade outlaw
Sanctified trouble maker, but he never sinned, naw
And he lived his life by a different set of rules
The culture ain't approve so you know they had to bruise him
That's the way they do, man they swear they so gangsta
Everyone the same, everybody do the same stuff
Tattoos, piercings, smoking up and drinking
Money and sex, plus them extravagant weekends
Man if that's the high life of puff puff pass that
You live evaporated like missing a gas cap
I guess I'm past that, I'm in rebellion
Rather have a dollar in my pocket than a million
I'm scared to worship money and my wants over Elyon
I remain a rebel while the rest of them just carry on
This is what I live for, its the hill I'm buried on
If Jesus is the truth that means one of us is very wrong
Think about it

[Hook:]
Rebel, I'm in rebellion [repeated]
I know in our day rebel means sinner
But everyone is sinning, so it’s no longer rebellious to sin
Jesus was a rebel who was counter cultural

[Verse 2:]
No glory in me, all glory's to the King of the throne
You either love him or you leave him alone
But you can't do both
Yeah I know you heard that once in a song
I pray you hear it ten more 'fore you're gone
Hey listen up holmes, the stage is the corner the crowd is the streets
And I rap the bread of life because they dying to eat
Yeah I'm a rebel, you know the kind that die in the street
Cause you refuse to conform won't eat the king's meat
Christ rebelled by shunning the culture
He eating with the sinners, giving Pharisees ulcers
He never got married, he was broke plus homeless
And yeah that's the God I roll with
Your boy got a wife, and no I never cheated
I'm praying for humility whenever I get heated
Forget about the drugs, rebel against pornography
This ain't how it ought to be homie its how its gotta be
A rebel

[Hook:]
Rebel, I'm in rebellion [repeated]
[Spoken sample]
You’re just a conformist, if you're drunk and naked and driving around on a loud motorcycle smoking cigarettes and breaking commandments
And getting pregnant out of wedlock
Everyone's done that, it's so tiring
If you really want to be a rebel, read your Bible, because no one is doing that
That’s rebellion
That’s the only rebellion left
