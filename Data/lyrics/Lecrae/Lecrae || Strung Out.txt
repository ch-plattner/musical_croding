How could I trust you? You lied to me all along
You strung me out...

I'm going through withdrawals, the shakes and all
You did me dirty, I almost died dawg
I let you play me, and plus you gave me
All the filthy things I wanted, all my sinful cravings
But I see you, yeah you're see-through
Somebody opened up my eyes and I don't need you
I gotta leave you, before you take my life
I used to date you then I went ahead and made you wifey
Yeah, you had me feelin' for the stuff you offer
You such a scoffer, I know you want me in my coffin
But girl you already lost it, your ways are perished
Thank you God for Your salvation, this is what I cherish

How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?
How could I trust you? You lied to me all along
You strung me out... [x8]

Uh, I'm on your grip, I'm on your grasp
You had me mesmerized, you had me in your hands
Luster the eyes, the pride of life
You offered me the world, you made it look so nice
You took me high, but left me down and out
I run right back to you thinkin' that you would help me out
You never satisfy, you only gratify
You're just a bad illusion, to every passerby
And I don't want you 'round, you only bring me down
So glad I quit you I don't miss you 'cause you had me down
So get gone, get gone [x7]

How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?
How could I trust you? You lied to me all along
You strung me out... [x8]

Do not love the world or the things in the world
If anybody loves the world, the love of God is not in 'em
The world's passing away...
Along with its desires but...
Whoever does the will of God will live forever
I know it hurts sometimes
We've got to go through withdrawal
'Cause we've been strung out

How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?
How could I trust you? You lied to me all along
You strung me out... [x8]
