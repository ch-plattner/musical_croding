[Bun B:]
Yo, Lecrae, what's up?
It's the OG Bun B
You know everything you see should always be about the truth, man
I've always told people, man, don't fake, you know, who you are or try to create a character because everything comes to the light
So just be who you are, be true to yourself
If they see your true struggle people will relate to you
And that's what I got to say to you, man
Just be true to who you are, people will recognize your struggle, 
and they'll walk with you as you walk your walk, know what I'm saying?
