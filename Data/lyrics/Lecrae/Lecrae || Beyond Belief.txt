[Hook:]
Beyond belief, beyond belief, beyond belief, beyond belief

[Verse 1:]
This is why we live and why we die,
This is why we laugh and why we cry
This life that we're livin' it was given by the God who has risen from the grave unto the sky
I look at my face, I look at my sin, I look at His grace, I look at my past
He said it's a race and now I live on apart of the race

And now we burst from the earth cause it's cursed
But I know it gets better cause it couldn't get worse
I was like dead and my sin in my head was placed far away from God full of hurt
And now I've been changed I gotta move on
I give you my thoughts, I give you my song
I give you my days, I give you may nights
I give you my ways, I give you my life
My life, my life, my life

[Hook:]
Beyond belief, beyond belief, beyond belief, beyond belief

[Verse 2:]
No, my rights are not my own
No, my life is not my own
No, even as I write this song
I forsake my ways, forsake my throne
Christ reigns supreme, Christ reigns the King
I'm nothing without Him
I Couldn't live, couldn't breathe
My life is worthless without worship
So now my purpose is His service
This is certain, we've been purchased
We've gotta go with truth that God is perfect
Worst sins and life full of sin and curses
But Christ shed blood so that we could be purchased
Move past the pain, move past the hurt
Move past the dead, You're an issue revert
Move past the pain, move past the hurt
Move past the dead, You're an issue revert (revert!)
