Huh, Why don't we just...
Treat this song like a...an anger management class
Ya feel me?

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm hatin', I'm pushin', I'm shovin'
Somebody better get me 'cause I'm 'bout to do somethin'
I'm angry...

Yeah, been up all night, got me feelin' weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school, these people testin' me
But disrespectin' me I will respond agressively
A long day, short fuse, in the worst mood
My temper red-hot, I will give these boys blues
Hard livin' got me feelin' very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin' to crush these other shellfish
Forget a chip up off my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'
If people pop off at the mouth I try to keep cool
All I wanna do is fix it, troubleshooter
Yeah it sounds wrong, if this carries on
The faith I claim to have, I probably never owned
Empty waiting room, running out of patience
This is anger management? Give me another agent

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm hatin', I'm pushin', I'm shovin'
Somebody better get me 'cause I'm 'bout to do somethin'
I'm angry...

I'm angry every mornin' befo' I get up out the bed
This dog keep on barkin' I'ma bust him in the head
Uncle keep on trippin' if he want to he can get it too
Anybody say another word I'ma act a fool
I hit the door, brush my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride, anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive
Really hate to say it 'cause it's killin' me inside
All I wanna be is loved and it's eatin' me alive
Don't nobody love me man, my momma and my daddy gone
Uncle ain't my uncle 'cause I'm livin' in a foster home
I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth
'Cause I read Galatians 5 and I did see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, "God take this thing away"

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm hatin', I'm pushin', I'm shovin'
Somebody better get me 'cause I'm 'bout to do somethin'
I'm angry...

Would die for my respect but, I got no humility
And Jesus paid my debt while I reject Him willingly
And man I got some nerve, holdin' anger in my heart
The Father coulda come serve me that beef up A La Carte
Not to mention torture Jesus took for my misfortune
I been freed from the law, but I'm servin' these court orders
Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you sorry, better be
Better bein' mad at you, than tryin' to be a better me
Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna' demonstrate His worth
And though He show me plenty grace, I don't extend the other verses
And that anger led to murder, when you pull up on the murder scene
It's Jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me
1st Peter 2:23 man,
When they used to hurl insults at Jesus, He didn't retaliate. He intrusted Himself to the One that judges justly. The gospel manages our anger, ya feel me? The solution is to gain a heart that's thankful for grace in Jesus Christ!

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy 
I'm hatin', I'm pushin', I'm shovin'
Somebody better get me 'cause I'm 'bout to do somethin'
I'm angry...
