
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me

I honestly grow insecure as I get older
Cuz' even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder
Comes a day when you slower, time is taking its toll
45 on the back of the jersey upon your soul
I'm scared of letting go, I don't know what the future holds
My nightmares are having nightmares
I'm quite scared of what's right and fair
How I fear an eternity
Will I hear well done when he turn to me?
Will I hear you care too much about
All this stuff that really don't matter?
You chase the wind and you don't want it
Got to the top of a 2 foot ladder
What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after?
Will I end up empty-handed when I stand before my master?
Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster?
Add in my selfish ambition
All the while, subtracting what matters
I don't know

[Hook:]
At late nights, I can't sleep
Will I fall? Will I peep?
Through the curtains, all I see, fingers pointed at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking，thinking bout'
At late nights, I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains, all I see fingers pointed right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking， thinking bout'it all

In high school, we tried to act all tough
I remember a couple times, I couldn't back that up
Like when I ran from them vatos, scuffing up my sapatos
Scared of losing my high, I was so embarrased inside
If I could go back in time, I would stand and say something like
I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared
I'm lying, I'm scared of these thoughts in my head
I'm scared of possibly pushing people right over the ledge
When I say I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then, I turn around and buckle
Under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that can teach my pain a lesson
But I rather not address it
Address that's in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm something less
And I'm such a mess

[Woman:]
C'est lui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Et c'est lui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

And it just so happen, I'm wrestling with my status
I'm trying to see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me, count me out on a count of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs, trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around, I wonder what that's about
Yeah! They wanna be politically correct, I suppose
But，I'm comfortable in my skin
While they just pretending they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing
In front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So, I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors, no functional saviors
I'ma tell that truth till it kill me
I'm chilling with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot him
And the ones who won't let me say
I ain't scared no mo'

[Natalie Lauren:]
Everybody always
They gon have something to say rather you like it or not
Everybody always
They gon' have something to say
Baby, don't take it to heart

[Woman:]
恐怖を受け入れることができないものは、
それに打ち勝つことができないだろう。
全てのものを受け入れたとき、
自由は存在し、恐怖は解き放たれる。
