The throne of my heart.
Occupy it. Reign supreme
Kill my lust and pride and all my other things ugly things.
Wage a holy war inside me til Your overcome
Let Your kingdom come and Let Your will be done.
I was worthless. I was dead.
Foul. Nasty. Dirty.
I had no eyes to see or ears to hear that You are worthy.
But Your Spirit hit me.
It gave me new direction.
I see the deeper things.
I called it depth perception.
Now Your presence is my treasure, never ending peace.
And they can't keep me from Your love cause it'll never cease. (Naw!)
So I pray You keep me, cause I can't keep myself (No!)
Protect me from my sin. I know I'm bad for my health.
And I'm dieing to know You. Wake me up and let me read.
Treat Your words so if they cut me this is what I bleed.
Give me a double feature.
Give me a triple portion.
I'm coming back for seconds, thirds, fourth, more, more, more!

If I don't know it. Teach me please though I'm undeserving.
Don't let me loose sight of my Savior, cause my Savior's worthy. (Jesus!)
Apart from Him I'm zip, zero, ziltch, nada, nothing.
No point in acting like I'm somebody to prove somethin'.
Open my understanding when I read the Scriptures.
It's still Your word inside a darkened wretched lowly sinner.
Make me acquainted with Your covenants and perfect plans.
Humble me by showing me the world's in Your hands.
Lead me in the truth. (Truth!)
Wisdom. Revelation.
Apply Your blood to my dirty soul for salvation.
And help me believe.
Lord, Lead me to faith.
Just teach me Your ways.
I'm in need of Your grace.
Purify my heart.
Fill me with Your Spirit.
Occupy me with Your presence.
Keep Your servant near.
Give me faith to behold.
Write Your name on my soul.
Make me whole for Your glory
and Your name to be known. (More, More, More)

A sinner.
I understand my state.
I know my sins are numberless.
Iniquities are great.
But You are adequate.
I mean You adequate.
To clean me from my nonsense.
From it I repent.
I'm never satisfied
More... More I gotta grow.
Adding to my faith virtue.
Knowledge of self-control.
You all I need to know.
The only one I crave.
If I can't have You everyday, then take me to my grave.
Help me to pray in faith.
Lean in upon Your will.
Strengthen me with conviction.
Show me the sins that kill.
Nothing exceeds Your power.
Nothing too great a task.
Never too much to hope for.
Nothing too small to ask.
Wisdom is unsurpassed.
Begging to see Your face.
Itching to see Your glory.
Burning for Your grace.
All I know is I want it.
People don't understand.
They never tasted anything.
Great is the great I AM.
I gotta have (More!)
