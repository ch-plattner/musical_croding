By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gone ride, we gone win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

Keep me in my timezone when my mind's gone
When I'm flyin' home
And I'm stressed out and I'm tempted to get that styrofoam
And go pour it up, but you know what's up
And you know that ain't gone solve nothin'
I mean Lord forbid I might fall or somethin'
And I'm all or nothin' cause (all I need is you)
To hold me down like bed straps to the psych ward
It's killing me but you still with me when I fight hard
And (all I need is you)
You digging me when I'm igging you
Get with me when my cars pulled
Coulda dealt with me but you fell for me 'for I fell for you
To keep me on that right path and the right math
Cause you plus nothin' is everything
You my everything, saying
(All I need is)
You, ain't gotta question my allegiance
Cause the way you love me I could never leave ya, I need ya

(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gone ride, we gone win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

How did I fall in this?
No condition that get a mention but you offered this
Unconditional love, I swear I sell it all for this
I'm tryna keep it together, forgive my awkwardness
But umm, often this issue in me often is
Valley of shadows and I know they trying to pick me off in this
But all I need is you
It's funny just how off I get when I ain't ridin' with you
No adjectives for you awesomeness
They burning one for that burn out
This life in God, I'm all turnt out
Took time out to put time in so I turn to you when I'm worn out
All I need is you
You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile
Know what you do
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressin' less and I be wantin' to show off and stunt
There ain't nothin' to want, you give me all that I need
All I need is you to keep that fire burnin' for me
All I need is you

(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gone ride, we gone win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

Ain't nobody gone get in the way
Put that on my money in the bank
Cause you do what them others can't
And I love that, yea
We gone ride till the rims fall off
Above it all, we can never fall, yea
Hold my hand, we can have it all
Hold my hand, we can have it all

(All I need is you)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gone ride, we gone win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

You always pick me up when I'm feelin' down
You always make it better for me some how
All I need is you, cause all I need is you
(All I need is you)
