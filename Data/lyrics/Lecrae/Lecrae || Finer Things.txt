Candy paint
P-piece of chain
Money stacks
D-diamond ring
People playing that price of vain
Me, I just want the finer things
Haters hate
P-people change
Lost the family, f-face the pain
Before they take my breath away
I just want the finer things

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Look, You want a piece of chain? I want a piece of mind
I had money in the bank while pops is dying
I can get more money can't buy no time, huh
In a room trying not to cry
Spent quality time so I'm good
Could've been out waxing that hood
Of my foreign car, like some sort of star
Stead of giving my time like I should, huh
You wanna know what's cool?
A daddy dropping his kids off at school
And when his kids is grown with kids of they own
And say my daddy ain't raise no fool
Sometimes, I sit on a plane full of pain
Care less about a grammy or the fame
I just want to see my kids change
And give up my art for their heart
That's gain
Mayne, so tell me what you making?
Money or a difference
You was made for that or get paid for that
What's yo' excuse and yo' mission?
When nobody remembers my name
Or the clothes I wore to that thing
I still rest in peace with my sanity
For them lives I got to help change
Finer things

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Okay, I been there, done it to
Seen it all, no birthday suit
Red carpet in my armani suit
Sitting V.I.P. with ya' favorite group
Bad chicks, actress
R&B diva catch a fever while I'm leaving out the back quick
Now, tell me that woun't boost your arrogance
Exactly
From Dallas to a palace
In Dubai, to the messi tactics
In Africa, I'm not bragging
Just explaining that I ain't lying when I'm saying that I've had it all
Dawg, enough bucks under my mattress
So buy what I want
No more lifting like it's practice
Nope, that's just racks on racks, and bracket
Fast life, race with me
Gassed right? this pace isn't
That life, we should stay living
It'll make it last, we chase feelings
I did that, but I ain't get jack
Just enough for the bluff, so try to help you might get jack
And man that's truth, so get back
Cuz' they hit back
Let me help you
