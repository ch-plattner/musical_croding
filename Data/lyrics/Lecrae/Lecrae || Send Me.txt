[Chorus:]
Send Me, I'll Go
Send Me, I'll Go
Send Me, I'll Go
Let Me Go, Let Me Go
Send Me, I'll Go
Send Me, I'll Go
Send Me, I'll Go
Let Me Go, Let Me Go [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I Seen it wit my own two
Theres no way I can show you
A perfectly poverty stricken people with no view
And I bet you can't believe this
They never heard of Jesus
Heard of Young Buck, Lil' Wayne, and Young Jeezy
No One signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch Xzibit pimpin a hummer
While a nine-year-old is shot down
No one screamin, "Stop now!"
No bridge illustrates for criminals who on Lockdown
People deep in Africa, lookin for an answer bra
In China men are dyin men until they know who died for sin
So, look what grace did
Not for us to stay in
Inside our comfort zones at home in Momma's basement
Get out on the grind ya'll, aint no better time dog
I know you read the Great Commission let me just remind ya'll
Make Disciples of the Nation teach them to obey the Lord
Hate to never lead someone to Christ before I see the Lord

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hey, after 1000 years in the west and the church is
Gettin bigger daily without understandin worship
Some regenerated but alot aint saved
You walk outside and be surprised cause the block aint changed.
And the numbers they be gettin them
Somethin still aint hittin them
American's aint Christian they just practicin the ritual
Thats why we should be missional hey what you think I'm spittin for
United States is dyin and the east is lookin pitiful
Some places if they catch you they'll arrest you and they'll serve you
But they still need the word too the gospel should be heard too
We claim we aint ashamed but yet we still aint hit the block up
We in our Christian bubble while our brothers gettin locked up
Lord I wanna Stop up
Take a bag and Walk up
In a country where sharin my faith may get me Shot up
Anyway ya go whether my city, Lord or Far abroad
I just wanna show 'em Jesus Christ the risen Holy God.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I know they dyin in the streets
Over in the Middle East
Some kids seekin peace
Others holdin up a piece
If the violence doesnt cease
Then at least, the deceased
Might know Jesus as their savior as their body hit the streets
And I know this is a graphic view
I pray that its attackin you
'Tractin you, to act and do what you see in the back of Luke
Matthew 24 and 14 We should read it twice
Before we think that life is just about us bein free in Christ
Look dog, life is more than Church, Work, and Football
What if you were dead in sin and Christians overlooked ya'll
This is why we leave the couch and leave the comforts of our house
To show a dyin world a God they'd prolly never read about

Yeah...The Great Commission says make Disciples of all nations
Have we even made em in our own nation?
Come on Christians
Missions exist because worship doesnt
People don't worship the God that made them
We Ambassadors..Let's Go!

[Chorus]
