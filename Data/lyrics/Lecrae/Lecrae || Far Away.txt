[Chorus:]
Far, Far Away, Far Away, Far Away (you feel so)

Far, Far Away, Far Away, Far Away

[Lecrae:]
Hopeless,
I can spell it, I can smell it in the air,
Lotta people wonder if you still care,
And are you still there, Cause I lost it all
I keep calling your name, but do you hear my call
*And are you still involved, At home I'm left alone
I wander the streets, cause I no longer have a home
My Brothers all GONE! My Sisters all GONE!
My family and my friends ain't gun be here in the mornin'
You see me here mournin'
They say you feel my pain, They say you went through it,
*say die is to gain
But I ain't gave nothing, I lost everybody
Now I'm loosin' my mind and my faith is all I got
I'm still holding on, that's why I still pray
Feelin' empty inside, I can't make it through the day
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
I'm talking to you now, but I promise that you feel so FAR

[Chorus:]
Far, Far Away (You seem) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (So, So)
Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away(You seem) Far Away (So, So)
Far-Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away(You seem) Far Away (You're So, So)
Far, Far Away(You feel) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (So...)

[Lecrae:]
Dead hopin' waitin' only for awhile now
Because the beat that I ain't sure if I can smile now
Look at this devistation,
Look at the pain and sorrow,
Somebody fet me lies and promise me a bright tomorrow
I know the God I follow, is bigger than disaster
Big enough to handle any evil that harass us
But I feel like he passed us, Pain overtook us
Buildings tumbled over head as the ground shook us
God adieu forsook us
Are ya still with me?
I know you save souls, I trust you to forgive me
Relief can you hear me? Hey rest can you give me
Hey peace can you see me, hey Love can you hear me
I don't know what to do I ain't lookin' for answers
I just need you to hold my hand through this cancer
Tell me you never left, even in the midst of death
Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath!

[Chorus:]
Far, Far Away (Ya feel) Far Away (You're so) Far Away (So, So)
Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (You're So, So)
Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (You're So, So)
Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (You're So...)

For God Alone
Oh My Soul, Wait In Silence
For My Hope Is From Him
He Is My Only Rock And My Salvation
My Fortress- I Shall Not Be Shaken

On God Rests
My Salvation
My Glory
My Mighty Rock
My Refuge is God
Trust In Him At All Times People,
Pour Your Heart Out Before Him
God Is A Refuge For Us
... Ye

[Chorus:]
Far, Far Away (HE'S NOT!) Far Away (HE's NOT!) Far Away (HE'S NOT! - YOU KNOW MY GOD! IS NOT!)
Far, Far Away (HE'S NOT!) Far Away (HE's NOT!) Far Away (HE'S NOT! - YOU KNOW MY GOD! IS NOT!)
Far, Far Away (He's Not) Far Away (No. He's Not) Far Away (MY GOD IS NOT!)
Far, Far Away (He's Not) Far Away (He's Not!) Far Away (He's Not)... Yeh!

[Lecrae:]
We Love You Lord, We Love You Lord,
We Trust that You are Not that Far Away
We Love You Lord, We Love You Lord,
We Trust that You are Not that Far Away
Help Us Be The Church,
Help Us Be The Church...
To Love Your People,
As they Love the World.

Amen.
