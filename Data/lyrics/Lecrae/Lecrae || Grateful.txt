
Father, You're so good
We just wanna thank You on this one, Lord
It's all about You, Lord

Clap, Put your hands together
If you love Jesus Christ, put your hands together and Clap, clap
Put your hands together
If you're in love with God, y'all, put em together

Lord, You've done so much for us
Look at the faith, You entrust to us and plus,
You're benevolent
God, it's evident
You're the giver of the life that we're cherishing
You walk on winds majestic flawless
You saved the lost, redeemed the lawless
I thank You for letting me know You
Fortunate that I should even get to behold You
Lord, I'm lowly
You chose me
To witness Your glory by being made Holy
You know me, my ins and outs
You calm all of my anxieties and end my doubts
Thank you to the Holy Spirit living within me
Though times I may grieve You, the Son has cleansed me
No longer fear the terrors of night
If 10, 000 fall on my right, I'll call on Your might

Lord, I'm grateful for all that You are to me
I'll walk with you daily, but still it amazes me
How You never change, never change, never change
Your love, it stays the same, stays the same, stays the same

Goodness, gracious, Lord
Anybody in the hood ever taste this before?
Been chased by the Lord, been embraced by the Lord
Got me sittin back just givin' thanks to the Lord
But even in the midst of that there's plenty of little things I forget to add
All these little things I will miss so bad
So let me take a second and mention that
I appreciate the things You do
And worship is more than just trying to sing to You but still
You know we're gonna sing to You
And say thanks for some other little things You do
Thanks for the mornings that You open my eyes
And I don't see 20/20 but I see alright
Thank You, Lord, yeah, I can see that sky
You created with the sun, yeah I can see that rise
Thank You

Thank God I can rest in You
You're perfect, my life I invest in You
Your mercy endures, Your Grace is sufficient
You're holy and pure You gave me vision and
Some say they wanna touch the sky
But I rather touch the God who can justify
The ocean, the mountains, the clouds amaze me
I can't believe I know the God that made these
Sometimes I can be that guy who takes for granted the breathe I breath inside
Yes, I'm fearfully and wonderfully made
These are gifts that you've given even to the depraved
And if your boy wasn't saved you would still deserve praise, you're the God of ages
I'm glad I can open your pages
And see with amazement all your wonderful ways
