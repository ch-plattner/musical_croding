To keep and care it you've got to water it
To keep and care it you've got to water it

She ain't never seen garden of Eden
Only seen garden of bleeding
And some are gonna lie and hate and make her feel like she's a heathen
She ain't never seen garden of Eden
Only seen garden of bleeding
And some are gonna lie and hate and make her feel like she's a heathen

Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose

Their roots dirty but their petal stay pretty
Somebody tried to take the purity say they aren't worthy
The black rose rose deep in the city streets
But them stems still peak up under the concrete yeah
Bleak is a rowd looking life but them never seen a flower
Grow under the moonlight
Mama had me readin solo nights
I was looking for identity they have stole mine twice

So I turn to the rude boy gangsters first but the bad man withers and returns to the earth
Now it's ashes to ashes dirt to dirt a black rose without a chance to grasp her worth
She ain't never seen garden of Eden
Only seen garden of bleeding
And some are gonna lie and hate her and make her feel like she's a heathen
No Cry for me cry for me this is how it goes but Jah knows all though yuh was my black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Been to school since I was [?] and the government won't tell us medicine they wanna kill us
There's blood pan di side walk blood pan di doors
There's blood up on them ceilings why there's pan di floor
No one to keep and care us our fathers too embarrassed to show us he's a player so mama's a single parent
Them children grow without the fertilizer that they needed and the black rose rose in a garden full of weeds needles and evil
But God sent people who reflect the light of the sun they get it done
The rose grows cold wind blows through the streets and the ice on the leaves so heavy she gets weak
And there's not a helping hand upon the scene to be seen
And when all seems lost the gardener in em' G's he handles her with care and he show her she a queen and them thorns are the defense mechanism she'll never need
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
Black rose black rose
