
started with hanging posters on my bedroom walls
to battle rapping for status up in the school halls
just call me double sushi thought I was too raw
and hip hop was my home, I had my shoes off
6'3 in high school I skipped the hoop dream
if I don't blowup then maybe I'll try the school thing
I went to college to do my family a favor 
but I couldn't pick a major cause I wanted to be ma-jor
I tried selling work, but it didn't work.
so I worked - shoppers seen a clerk, fi'n go berserk
lunch break seen me writing 16's over micky dee's
skipping class making beats over 60 keys
and I love it even though I'm just chasing
selfish ambition couldn't tell your boy naything
watch out all you rappers cause they filling Lecrae in
but I was sleeping on the sun like the 'days inn'

and you could have the money, and you could have the fame. 
but me I want the glory, I'm living for the name
see life is just a picture, I see outside the frame
I'm living for the kingdom, and I ain't of the same
yeah, and I'ma chase that.  I'ma I'ma chase that
found the key to life and best believe that I'ma plate that
glory I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that
glory I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that

ugh, I remember chasing the green feeling blue
only check I'm counting is the mic check (1, 2)
all I wanted was the money and the fame and the new
somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room
all I wanted was doomed, the same kind Alexander the great felt
when the earth ran out of room
he conquered all he could but yet he still was consumed
by this never-ending quest for glory he couldn't fuel
like a typical fool I would go hard - shooting for the moon
but there's only one Son, no co-star.
chasing glory I shouldn't own, 
stead of living to make His name known I'm running after His throne. 
I thought being on TV where everybody could see me
was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me
I'll never be who I used to desperately want to be, 
I'm too worried bout the Lord getting credit instead of me

and you could have the money, and you could have the fame. 
but me I want the glory, I'm living for the name
see life is just a picture, I see outside the frame
I'm living for the kingdom, and I ain't of the same
yeah, and I'ma chase that.  glory chase that
found the key to life and best believe that I'ma plate that
glory I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that
glory I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that

I used to wanna do it big.  
when you're only focused on yourself - that's small
and they, they used to tell me as a kid
that I could do anything that I wanted cept fall
and now that I recall, I was chasing my goals
and every time I caught em they multiplied into more
I never even thought about whether the Lord approved
call it selfish ambition I call it "I'm making moves"
but history repeats itself, evil's what it is
cause lucifer was cast away for doing what I did
created by the God that spoke the earth into existence
instead of chasing the Father's glory he was chasing his
he lies to us all, told Adam he could ball
"why you following God when you can go get it all?"
I tell you what's better, or better yet worse.
chasing your own glory while doing the Lord's work, 
so holla if it hurts, but we were made for greater
our greatest satisfaction is making His name famous
so if we're never named among the greatest,
they don't critically acclaim us, 
ain't nothing to be ashamed of we gave it up for the savior!

I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that
and the Lord's goodness you should you should taste that
and you ain't living till you're living for His name
glory I'ma chase that, I'ma I'ma chase that.
