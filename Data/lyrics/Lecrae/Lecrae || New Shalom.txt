[Hook:]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom

[Lecrae:]
I wake up before I throw a beater on, I thank the Lord for peace, or you can say shalom.
I'm on and I'm gone out the door I'm gon' rep my home. New Jerusalem, yeah you know where we belong.
Got the Word in my heart. When the day start and the darkness wanna get us sparked up.
So I keep a guard up, cause the sin in me wanna get the best of me and have me all scarred up.
And I know I'm marked up by the Spirit still in me, fillin me up with everything I need.
Yeah I got that cheese, but I don't need a piece, I just need peace, please.
This life ain't easy matter fact it's opposite and I got the test results I'm very positive.
That's why I'm on this track with PRo because I'm posed to give some potent portions of potion proportionate to poster kids,
Of pain and suffering whose daddy never loved on them, and wouldn't know the peace of God if it was placed in from of them
And I was one of them, I don't take my life for granted
So I'm a use this day tryna share my faith and pray that seeds are planted

[Hook:]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom

[PRo:]
Early in the mornin A.M., you know that I thank Him 'cause He still calls me clean regardless of the mess I lay in.
My vision on the throne, clearer than Petrone, yessir I am gone, in my zone, thinking 'bout the way my Father put me on.
It's nothing but grace how He's still gives me faith and He died for the ultimate villain.
After this I obey regardless I'm chained when I should have been dead but I'm livin.
See I know when I'm wrong He won't leave me alone that's the beauty of God and His mercy.
So I'm singing this song about Him on the cross where my heart was the item of purchase.
While livin with pride � so worthless.
Say they wrestle and fight � but I merk it.
Whether live or down, dedicated to Christ, yessir I'm a stand on my purpose.
Put my faith in Him cause He's perfect.
Insurance like Geico, 'cause if I do not have His love I'm Norman Bates � psycho.
I go hard, I still Rebel with Lecrae.
Give my whole life for the King, don't Trip just let Him Invade.
I Sho Baraka Obama this peace is more than just worth it, so call Tedashii tell him Identity Crisis averted.

[Hook:]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom

24/7 all the time, yeah I'm on my grind, dyin' everyday I'm tryin', rhyme, hope to save they lives,
Peace � what I got, I feel released from the knots sin bound me in but Jesus had the keys to the locks.
Life is boot camp, yeah I know the drill, flesh kill, but His will, it's with His peace that I'm filled and it's real.
Earth is not my home, while I roam and roam, got the Lord up on my dome restin' in that new shalom.

See it goes C.H.R.I.S.T. G.O.D. His spirit inside of me.
And without his L.O.V.E. I'm another lost soul so obviously,
When I drank the Livin' Water that's nothing more than a product of the grace through faith that I found in Him,
The love He gives could accurse of sin, why should I ever give in?
So chase that money, get your wrist coders, refrigerators, I will be an outcast 'til he raise me up � elevator
Me and you, yo momma, yo cousin, my brother, pray we never sell our soul for a chance to be stuntin' 'cause everything that's good in me the Lord He's done it, run it.

[Hook:]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom
