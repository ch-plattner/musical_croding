She made me wanna get down on a knee
Yeah,
She made me wanna share everything I own,
How does it feel?

I was praying for a ten,
But I found the one,
And no girl compares to my virtuous love,
Cause what we got is truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Yeah

Listen, What's up my lady love?
My mamasita,
I know you know me,
But let's get to know each other deeper,
Cupid, you can keep em,
I don't believe em,
This kinda love we got is real,
This ain't no Mona Lisa,
No painted picture, No fairytale,
A lot of blood, sweat, and tears,
Yeah we know it well,
And I never kiss and tell, put our business in the streets,
It ain't nobodys business what we do between the sheets,
And I respect you too much,
Don't see you as my equal,
I see you as myself,
Me and you we the same people,
The way you let me lead you,
That's why I need you,
And when I'm on the road I miss you wanna see you,
You not perfect, you not perfect but you work it girl,
And you don't need a job unless you feel like workin girl,
Ain't worried bout your past I'm focused on our future lady,
But when I see us looking good... I see you baby

I was praying for a ten,
But I found the one,
And no girl compares to my virtuous love,
Cause what we got is truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Yeah

Yeah
Don't need a prenup,
It's you I love and not the money,
Know all my passwords but you don't need them things you trust me,
They think we crazy,
Head over heels,
I love your mind more than the way you dress head over heels,
Now I don't lace you in Gucci, Louis Vuitton, or Birkin,
But I give you the time and attention, faithfullness and it's workin,
But when you get upset and bother me I'm here to stay,
Can't wait to date you when you sixty and your hair is gray,
We ain't them, I ain't him, You ain't her,
But we the best we'll ever be minus me first,
Till they bury me you'll always be my lady,
And leavin you's like leavin myself,
It's crazy

I was praying for a ten,
But I found the one,
And no girl compares to my virtuous love,
Cause what we got is truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Yeah

I was praying for a ten,
But I found the one,
And no girl compares to my virtuous love,
Cause what we got is truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Truly something special,
Yeah
