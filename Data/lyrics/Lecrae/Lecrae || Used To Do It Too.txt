[Intro:]
Hey, KB, man, you know we don't brag on our past
We just relate
Some folks think they mistakes
Gonna keep them out the gates
It ain't about what you do, it's about what you did
Let's go!

[Hook:]
I used to do it too, I used to do it too,
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
I used to do it too, I used to do it too,
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
But I'm changed, now I'm something different (Aye)
I'm changed, I love the way I'm living (Aye)
I'm changed, saved me from my own sin (Aye)
I'm changed, I learned how to live again (Aye)

[Verse 1:]
Uhuh
Ah man you name it bra, I promise I done done it all
So busy doin me that I ain't care at all (I'm changed)
I know I ain't the person that I used to be
I look the same but I promise this a newer me
See what I used to be was selfish and conceited
I was living for myself and telling Jesus he could beat it
At the time I couldn't see it, all I saw was havin fun
Went to church to look for ladies, not to look upon the Son
I was a hedonist, now Jesus is my pleasure
I was a narcissist but now I'm lookin betta.
But I ain't fix myself, ain't turn myself around
I gave it up and told the Lord that he can have it now

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I was tryin to figure what's a goone to a goblin
That's nonsense tell me this though what's a goone to the God-Head
I gotta seed sown from the Regal
Then He deboed all my evil and my ego
Now I devote, all of me bro, to the King so
We know that he redeems souls
Got that right homie I'm different.
At times I don't be feelin it.
Salvation ain't a feelin lil homie it's a positionin
Great sinners sin is great but the Great Savior is omnipotent
And you quit dissin Him you ain't got no sins that He can't forgive.

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You see Satan uses guilt to strip away our hope
He shows us our mistakes and tells us we're a joke
I used to sit and mope like what's the point in all
If I'm a Christian how come everyday I seem to fall
But I ain't know that all my sins were nailed upon the cross
I found this out in chapter 2 in the Book of Colossians
See the devil's a liar, yeah he's an accuser
He tells me I'm worthless, he says I'm a loser
But now I refuse to let him lead me wrong
Reading the Word in the morn got me feeling strong
I found my worth in Christ and I'm pursuing truth
A living testimony so you can do it too

[Hook]
