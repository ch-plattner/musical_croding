
If u ain't got no place 2 stay
Come on baby 'round this way
Stay with me baby
But let me tell u how it's gonna b

There's a theocratic order.
There's a theocratic order now

This is how it's gonna b
If u wanna b with me
Ain't no room 4 disagree
1+1+1 is 3

Take ur time and think it thru
If this is what u wanna do
I ain't really that hard 2 please
Cuz 1+1+1 is 3

Stroke ur hair a hundred times
Let me c what I can find
D u know about the order.
Do u know about the order, now?

The Banished Ones:

"We are the Banished Ones and we have come 2 dance
If u will not let us, we'll have 2 kick ur pants!"

Who's that knockin' on r door?
Didn't we throw u out b4?
I'm 'bout 2 get rowdy!
I'm 'bout 2 get rowdy, now!
Make me wanna do something.

We could b surrounded in the palace
"Everybody wants 2 get u!"
I don't care

How many y'all just came 2 dance?
Let me c u shake ur pants
We don't give a duck what u got on
U just need 2 work that sexy body all nite long
Come on

Where them Banished Ones at?
"Said they 'round the back"
Don't cut 'em no slack
"I'm gon' tap, tap, tap"
But should I keep this party going?
"Brotha u know that!"

Moneyapolis, sing-Rainbow Children, raise ur hands
If we can't do it, nobody can!

Here they come y'all
Rally 'round the palace now
U know what we got 2 do!

How'd that fool get up in here?
Snagglevoice.
