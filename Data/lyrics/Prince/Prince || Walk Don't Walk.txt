
Walk on their side of the street?
Don't walk where it feels the best?
Walk away from people u meet?
Don't talk 2 strangers
Unless they walk the way u want them 2?

Don't walk unless the others do?
I said walk, like u could use a ride?
Don't walk with a confident stride
Then people will walk over u
Don't talk until they tell u 2?
Don't talk if it's against the rules?
Just walk away and be a fool?
That's what they wantcha 2 do
Yeah, that's what they want u 2 do

Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

Don't talk if it's against the rules?
Just walk away and be a fool?
That's what they wantcha 2 do
So u got 2 walk like u wanna make it!
Don't walk like u just can't take it
Go on and walk on any side you like!
Don't walk wherever they tell u 2 - psyche!
The sun will shine upon u one day
If u're always walkin' your way

The sun will shine upon u one day
If u're always walkin' your way

Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

(tellin' me now, just walkin')
Said I'm walkin' on your side of the street (tellin' me now, just walkin')
I'm talkin' 2 the people I meet (tellin' me now, just walkin')
Alright

Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk
Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk
Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk
