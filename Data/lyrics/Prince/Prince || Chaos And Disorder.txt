Hey, yeah

Carjack used to fix flat tires
Cadillac used to be a Benz
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost you in the end

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

He's gay, used to mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed
You're played, used to mean top forty
Now forty days of being played ain't proud

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Safe sex used to mean no babies
When intercourse used to mean fun
If I had fifteen ladies
I would only fuck with one

I get hit by a mortar, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa
