I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Play

I think it's love
I feel for you - I think it's love
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think it's love

Play

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you
