
If U leave her now 
Ur never gonna 2 c her again - Never 
Now she's gonna need a shoulder 2 cry on 
She's gonna need a friend 
She's gonna need a pillow case - something 2 put those tears on 
And Eye've got some purple satin lacys 
1 second later than the second U gone 

She' gonna miss U at first 
But then she's gonna buy me things 
That's when Eye'm gonna lay her 
'cross my piano stool and sing 2 her 

[Chorus]
Honey, Eye tried 2 tell him 
That U were the marrying kind 
A faithful 1-man-woman 
The best he would ever find 
Eye guess he wasn't trying 2 hear that 
So there ain't nothing left 2 say 
Eye tried 2 tell him if U run 2 me 
Eye won't run away 

If U leave her now 
U'll never get another glimpse 
Eye'm going 2 lace her with enough ice to recap the polls 
There might b another solar eclipse 
She's gonna find: 
:bath water hot enough 2 b touched (oh, man. porkchop is hurtin') 
Eye'm gonna put her on the same diet Missy went on 
U know she eat 2 much 
Tonight, she's gonna miss U at first 
But then she'll get used 2 me 
All of the tricks Eye would try 
2 make her take this ring and make love 2 me 

[Chorus]

Run away 
Don't run away
