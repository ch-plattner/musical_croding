It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out all night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see who ever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing nothing can take away these blues

Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around any girl I see
But they only reminds me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what it told me, guess what it told me
Said, "Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do."
But he's a fool

Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, baby
In your back yard
All died when you went away
I know living with me baby is sometimes hard
But I'm willing, see I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
