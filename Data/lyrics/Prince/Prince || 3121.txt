
One mix, one mix, one mix, one mix, one mix, one mix, one mix...
One mix.
DJ - turn it up, turn it up. (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up...)
Let's go.
3121.
Hey mommy -
It's loco right?
3121.
Come on.

Through the gates.
Knock on the door.
Put your clothes in a pile, on the floor.
Take your pick from the Japanese robes and sandals.
Drink champagne from a glass, with chocolate handles.

Don't you wanna come? 3121.
Gonna be so much fun. 3121
That's where the party be. 3121.
You can come if you want to, but you can never leave.

Look over there. (Look over there)
There's another turn-on.
Butterflies scared that they're gonna be awake all night long.
Dancing in your belly, like a ballerina.
In spite of your efforts to calm them down.

Don't you wanna come? 3121.
Gonna be so much fun. 3121
That's where the party be. 3121.
You can come if you want to, but you can never leave.

Bounce party y'all.
It's going down people -
Like the wall of Berlin.

Lock the door. (Lock the door)
Til you see the sun. (Til you see it)
We gonna party, like there ain't going be, another one.
Futuristic, fantasy.
This is where the purple party people be.

Yeah.
This is where the party be. 3121.
This is where the party be. 3121.

Breakdown.
Guitar.

Don't you wanna come? 3121.
It's gonna be so much fun. (Yes it is.) 3121
That's where the party be. 3121.
You can come if you want to, but y'all can't never leave. (Not ever.)

It's going down y'all.
Like the wall of Berlin.
