(We don't stop) [repeat sample in song]

Love sign [x2]
Love, love

[Chorus:]
If U're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and 4 ever more
If U'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

In a chariot of red and gold
The cool, fuzzy voice said, "Come save your soul"
Before the fear of rejection reared its head
He stood before the masses and calmly said

[Chorus]

In the day of where and why we all belong
Don't nobody wanna hear a silly love song
And if they did then we would sing it on the news
While U're aiming your gun at me and I'm aiming back at U

[Chorus]

Now
Song now
Everybody sing the song now

If U only had one year left 2 live
What good is the time U spend if U got no love 2 give?
Let's all get up off the front and find a cause 2 back
Then we can teach the babies replications of the act, of the act

[Chorus 2x]

(Sick of evil knockin', yeah)
(Then ev..everybody, oh)
(We can have a little fun)
(Everybody, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(4 ever more)
(Make a little love now)
(We can make love instead of guns, oh)

Now
