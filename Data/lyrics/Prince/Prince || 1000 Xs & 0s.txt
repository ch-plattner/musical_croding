You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as you
Hot desert sun, you can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so you best believe

I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 you when you come back home, baby 
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 you when you come back home, baby 

When you give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
You can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries, all your miseries (All your miseries)
You can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea
Cuz...

I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses you when you come back home
Come here!

The world can be, well 2 put it frankly, such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is so damn hard 2 find
Seems like all we ever find is another reason 2 cry
As long as you got me I got your back and this is why

You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as you
Better lock the door, you better turn off the phone
Cuz I'm gonna give 1,000 reasons why we need 2 be alone

I got 1,000 hugs and kisses, baby, when you get back home
When you get back home

I wanna hold you, tie you up in lace
And I wanna kiss you, kiss you all over your face
I wanna love you all up and down
Give you love like you never had, all, ungagged and bound
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 you, baby
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 you when you come back home, baby)
I wanna, I wanna, yeah, I wanna hug you baby, kiss you
(I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 you when you come back home, baby)

Love you up and love you down
Love you till you make them sounds
