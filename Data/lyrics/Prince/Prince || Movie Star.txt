That'll give me an hour of free reign
Mo' drawers (Mo' drawers)

9:30 - gettin' dressed
I had a couple sips of wine
Boo! - I swear 2 God
My suit was hangin' fine
Everybody at the club freaked
When I stepped from the limousine
They said - "Ooh, it's good 2 see ya"
I said - "Oh, it's good 2 be seen
U know what I mean?"

Tell U what's good
It's a good thing we live close cuz I almost suffocated in that car
Next time I won't wear so much Paco Rabinni or whatever that
stuff...
I wonder if they got potato chips up in this...
Man, this ain't like them house parties we used 2 go 2
That's alright, I'm clean

2night, hey, I'm a movie star
I see myself on a silver screen, huh

I'm the only star on the scene
U know what I mean?

Man, I hate makin' movies
But I like that money, think I don't? Hmph

Boy or girl - it don't matter no more, I'm hot!

On the 1 the kick drum hit the triple beat
Baby, I was poppin'
Did one spin, did a second, did the splits
Came up, looked around, the joint was hoppin'
Hoppin'! The joint was hoppin'!
Somebody say "Movie Star!"
