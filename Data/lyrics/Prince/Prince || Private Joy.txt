My little secret, my private joy
I could never let another play with my toy
My little angel from heaven above
Oh oh oh oh oh I think I'm falling in love
And I ain't gonna tell nobody nobody 'bout my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy - you're my private joy
Private joy - such a pretty toy
Joy, you are my private joy

U're my little lover, Orgasmatron
Only I know, only I know, baby, what turns you on
U're my little secret neon light
Girl I wanna turn it on turn it on turn it on every night

Ain't gonna tell nobody nobody 'bout my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy - you're my private joy
Private joy - such a pretty toy
Joy - oh my private joy

Shoot me up baby, let's take a trip
I can't get enough can't get enough of your private private joy joy
Joy - such a such a pretty toy
Joy - you are my private joy
Joy - shoot me up baby, let's take a trip
Joy - can't get enough of your private
Joy - come on honey baby get up, get up

I strangled Valentino (He strangled Valentino)
Been mine ever since (been his ever since)
If anybody asks you (if anybody asks u)
You belong to Prince (you belong to Prince)
Come on baby, get up, get up, get up, get up
