I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table
I've been holdin' back this feelin'
4 far 2 long
Now that I'm willin', it's a fact
Is truly mighty strong
Like a child lost in the wilderness
'Till I reach my destination, I won't rest

Cuz I'm willin' (willin')
And I'm able (able)
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table (table)

There's some kings in my deck and a queen or 2
So u know there ain't nothin',
Nothin' that I wouldn't do (Nothin' that I wouldn't do)
It 'twas a long time coming,
But now that it's here
All the non-believers better fear me

Cuz I'm willin (willin' and able)
And I'm able
I got good and plenty cards
2 place on the table (table)

Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
Now that I'm willing, (this feelin')
This feelin'
It's truly mighty strong (truly, I... I)

I'm willing (willin')
And able (able)
My vision is all clear, I'm feelin' kinda stable
U know I am, u know I am
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
Ready 2 shout (shout, now whatcha say)
Ready 2 scream (scream, now whatcha say)
From the highest mountain top (whatcha say, whatcha say)

Lord, I'm willing and able
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(dance and sing, let me watch u do your thing)
(bring it to me)

Let me take a bite
2 see if u're ripe
I'm kinda thinkin' about
Takin' a hunk, chunk
A piece of your love tonight

Well hello, MC T on a mello
Swing low to the tempo
As I flow on a roll
Here we go, willing and able
Start the show right
With that type of hype
Lay my cards on the table tonite
Don't take me light
My flow hits u just like a lead pipe
While I'm clockin'
U just say 'fess
About the boots I'm knockin'
It ain't like that
(somethin' to keep the Jimmy so get) off my back
In fact u lack the knack
Step back before I show u how a fool acts, baby

Yeah
