
Heard about the party now 
Just east o' Harlem 
Dougie's gonna b there 
But u got 2 call him 

Even the soldiers 
Need a break sometimes 
Listen 2 the groove ya'll 
Let it unwind ur mind 

No intoxication 
Unless u c what eye c 
Dancin hot n' sweaty 
Right in font of me 

Call it what u like 
I'm gonna call it how it b 
This is just another one 
Of God's gifts 
Musicology 

Keep that party movin 
Just like eye told you 
Kick the old school joint 
4 the true funk soldiers 
Musicology 

Wish eye had a dollar 
4 everytime u say 
Don't u miss the feeling 
Music gave ya 
Back in the day? 

Let's Groove 
September 
Earth, Wind and Fire 
Hot Pants by James 
Sly's gonna take u higher 

Minor keys and drugs 
Don't make a rollerskate jam 
Take ur pick - turntable or a band? 

If it ain't Chuck D 
or Jam Master Jay 
Know what? 
They're losin' 
'Cause we got a PhD in 
Advanced Body Movin' 

Keep the party movin' 
Just like eye told u 
Kick the old school joint 
4 the true funk soldiers 
Musicology
