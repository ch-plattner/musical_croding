
Well
Dionne
U should have held my hand
U should have let me be your man
Dionne
U should have closed your eyes
U should have held on with both hands 2 your prize
Dionne
U should have let me down easy
If you had no plans 2 please me
Dionne

Dionne
I could have been the 1
I could have shown U the shelter reserved unther the sun
Dionne, Dionne
I could have whispered U'r name
I could have whispered U'r name if only 4 fun
Dionne
U should have let me down easy
If you had no plans 2 please me
Dionne, Dionne
Dionne

Dionne

Dionne, Dionne
We could have shared a martini
We could have danced 2 Mancini, till dawn
Dionne
I should have broke down and kissed U
I should have I just miss U
Dionne
