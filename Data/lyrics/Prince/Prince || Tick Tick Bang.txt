Ow! Bang, b-b-bang, bang
Bang.

U, yeah.
U're such a big tease, u get me all excited,
All excited then u go home.
U're like ice cream,
Knew I got 2 getcha, got 2 getcha, before u're all gone.

U're such a bombshell,
And if I ever get ya, ever get ya, ever get ya,
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over u
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over u
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang

U Ain't no cheap thrill,
Every time u tick I'd rather u bang,
But u leave me in a fire sweat (leave me in a fire sweat)
U're like a good pill
All I need is 2, and I'm so into u, u're the best stuff that I could get.

U're such a bombshell
If I ever get ya, ever get ya, ever get ya,
There's no telling how long I'd last.
Before I tick, tick, bang, all over u
All over u, tick, all over u, tick, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Ooh, I can't hold it. Ooh, it's getting all over me.
Ooh, I can't hold it. Ooh, it's getting all over me.

U're such a queen bee
Let me taste your honey, taste your honey, taste your honey, 4 it go bad
You're so slippery
Like this chain around my hip, I want a 24k relationship.
So baby don't spit me out, tick, tick, bang, all over u.
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang
Ooh, I can't hold it. Ooh, it's getting all over me.

U're such a bombshell
If I ever get ya, ever get ya, ever get ya,
There's no telling how long I'd last.
Before I tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, bang, all over u
All over u, bang, all over u, tick, tick, bang, all over u
Tick, tick, bang, all over u. tick, tick, bang, all over u
All over, bang, all over, bang, all over, tick, bang
