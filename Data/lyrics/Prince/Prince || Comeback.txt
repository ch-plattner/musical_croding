
Walking up the stairs
Just the afternoon
Sweet wind blew
Not a moment 2 soon
(Hoo) I cry when I realized
That sweet wind was U

Spirits come and spirits go
Some stick around 4 the aftershow
Don't have 2 say I miss U (don't have 2 say I miss U)
Cause I think U already know
If U ever lose someone
Dear 2 U
Never say the words their gone
They'll come back, yeah
They'll come back, yeah yeah
They'll come back
Tears go here
Tears go here
Tears go here
Tears go here
