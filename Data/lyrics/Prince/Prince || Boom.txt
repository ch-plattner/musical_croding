What if another universe 
Complete with sun and moon 
An entire galaxy and what's worse 
U and eye 2 soon 
Find each other xpanding beyond this dirty room 
Butterscotch mountains 
Son shine 

Run ur fingers up and down the 
Obelisk in the earth 
Down 2 33 rmps where 
The primordial gives birth 
Or else we lie neck high you and eye 
In one another's ooze 
Volcano magic 
Summer time 

Everybody knows what happens 
When you worship from afar 
The ebb and flow of angels 
Dancing around the star 
And if the sunrise is still a question 
The answer's in the dark 
Celibate 
Mushroom 
Canopy
