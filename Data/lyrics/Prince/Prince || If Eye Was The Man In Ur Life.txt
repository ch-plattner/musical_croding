[Chorus:]
If Eye was the man in your life 
Eye'd make U happy 
Eye'd treat U right 
Eye'd buy U flowers every single day 
Eye'd Give U power 
Eye'd do whatever U say 

Eye heard a rumor that Ur man he said he'd do U wrong 
and Ur so vain Ud think that Ur the 1 behind this song 
Sure U know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve 
and after he got what he want he just go up and leave 
and sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game 
he like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came 
If he's with another now U best believe the party's crackin 
Ur getting played girl, U better get your mack on 
and do onto others as they do onto U 
U call me on the day that U and him r just 2 through 

[Chorus]

was it U that Eye saw outside the liquor store 
waiting on that fool 2 purchase what Ud been dying 4? 
and b4 Eye c U drop a spill Eye have 2 bring U down 
now U got that chocolate barracuda hangin' round 
hangin' round your neck like a cheap gold chain 
he don't deserve 2 say that he ever knew Ur name 
much less he get 2 smell the perfume Eye gave U 
please don't tell me that U all got down 
better do onto others as they do onto U 
U call me on the day that U and him r just 2 through 

[Chorus]
