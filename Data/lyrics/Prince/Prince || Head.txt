
I remember when I met u, baby
You were on you're way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked The things you said
And I was so non-chalant
I didn't want you to be mis-led
But I've gotta have u, baby
I got to have you in my bed
And you said
"But I just a virgin And I'm on my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk
So full of spunk,
I'll give you Head
Til you're burning up
Head
Til you get enough
Head
Til you're love is red
Head
Love you til you're dead
You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But I, I came on your wedding gown
And you said, "I must confess,
I wanna get undressed and go to bed."
With that I jammed, you fool,
You married me instead
Now morning, noon, and night
I give u
Head
Til you're burning up
Head
Til you get enough
Head
Til you're love is red
Head Love you til you're dead
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Head, Head, Head, oh, Head, oh
Head
Till you're burning up
Head
Til you get enough
Head
Til your love is red
Head
Love you til you're dead
Head, Head, Head
(Ooh, baby, no)
Head, Head
Ooh, Head Head
(You said I could)
Head
Head
