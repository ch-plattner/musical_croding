
I could tell from the moment U walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress U had on
That wasn't your perfume
And what happened 2 the ring that I gave U?
What am I 2 assume?
I love U, but I just don't trust U anymore

U could tell from the moment U looked in my eyes
That I could see right through U
U must apologise
I've always given U the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know U trust me, but U don't love me anymore
No

I remember meeting U here in the good ol' days
I would never pick the flower of my favourite protege
Maybe if I would have
Then U would not treat me this way
U tricked me - but U will not anymore

No, no
I love you, but I don't trust U anymore
