(Uh)
(Mmm)
(Mmm, oh)
Shhh - break it down (Oh)
I don't want nobody else 2 hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do U after school like some homework
Ah... am I gettin' U hot? (Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) cuz then we'd have 2 stop (Please don't stop)

I'd rather wait 'til everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can U hear me girl?

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else 2 hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh (oh yeah) - we gotta break it on down
Can U hear me, babe?
Shhh - huh, we got 2 break it on down

Candle light - no (no), I don't think so!
The crackle of the flame will just spoil my flow
Besides, I can be your fire baby, yeah
Drippin' all over U like a ball of wax, relax and let go!

Break it down
I don't want nobody else 2 hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow (They better not dare)
Shhh - yeah, we gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can we groove 2night?
Oh yeah, ah - we gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Oh

Yeah
That's it, baby

Ah, U say U wanna slow jam? (Yes)
Then listen up girl, yeah
I wanna whisper music in your ear
That'll rock your, rock your, rock your world, oh
What's my name, baby? (I love U) Yeah
2night I'll teach U baby, teach U baby, teach U baby
2 scream it and scream it and scream it and scream it! Ow!

Break it down
I don't want nobody else 2 hear the sounds
This love (This love is a private affair)
Just me and U, baby (Interrupt the flow, they better not dare)
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah (We gotta break it on down, down, down)
Are U listening, baby?
Ah hear me baby, hear me baby
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)

U makin' me wanna ... oh!
Uh (Uh)
There it is
Uh (Uh)
Oh yeah
All night long
Are U diggin' this, baby? (Oh)
Break it down, break it down

(Shhh - break it down) [x3]
Down, down, down, down [x4]

Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about U

Oh yeah
Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about ... U
