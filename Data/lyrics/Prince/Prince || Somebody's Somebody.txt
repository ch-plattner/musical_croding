
Somebody's somebody
Somewhere, someone
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I just can't sleep
Outside the rain is pourin', I'm lonely as can be
Maybe 2night'll be different than the nights before
I need 2 feel someone beside me, I can't be alone no more

2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done (Oh yeah)

This big ol' world can be so empty livin' in it all alone
I realize, in its best disguise, a pretty house don't make a home
There's a hunger deep inside of me, how the fire burns
I wanna give good love 2 someone and get good love in return, oh

2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done (Oh yeah)

Somebody's somebody
Someone
I wanna be somebody's body
Oh yes, oh yeah

Someone 2 hold me in that hour midnight
Someone 2 console me when things ain't goin' 2 right
Someone 2 bring me dinner sometime, yeah (Mine, all mine)
Somebody I can call all mine

It's 2:05 in the morning and I got no one 2 call
I'm longin' 2 hear another voice inside these lonely walls (Lonely walls)
Maybe 2night'll be different (different) than the nights before (Maybe not)
I need 2 feel someone beside me, I cannot be alone no more (No more, no more!)

2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done (Oh yeah)

2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done (Oh yeah)

Somebody's somebody
I don't wanna be alone, no no!
I don't wanna wait another day, no!
I'll do it over and over and over and over, yeah!

Ooh, I don't wanna wait, no!
Can I belong 2 U, baby? Oh yeah! (I wanna belong 2 someone)
Ooh, slow, deep and long
Do me over and over and over and over

(2night I wanna be somebody's somebody)
Oh yeah
If U're out there, come on, baby
I'll keep it hot 4 U
(2night I wanna be somebody's somebody)
Come on, baby
(2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done, oh yeah)
Done

Somebody's somebody
