
9 out of 10 mortals agree 2day; 2 much fame causes spiritual decay 

2 all the punx who believe life imitates music 
No more candy 4 you we can't hang with you 
2 all the punx who wanna b rock stars and do what they do 
There's no future 4 you that's the life of a fool 
No more candy, no more candy 4 you we're 2 funky and you can't handle r groove 

2 all the freax in the magazines who never paid no dues 
No more candy 4 you u can't sing it's true 
2 all the freax walking in2 walls somebody put a spell on you 
No more candy 4 you eye guess the devil got a brand new fool 

[Chorus]

2 all the haterz on the internet somebody's lookin' at you 
No more candy 4 you they got ur number now, fool 
2 all the suckerz winning anything and thanking the lord 4 what 
They do 
No more candy 4 you no more candy 4 you 

Eye am 2 funky and you can't handle my groove.
