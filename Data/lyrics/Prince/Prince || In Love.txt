
Ever since I met you, baby
I've been wantin' to lay you down
But it's so hard to get you
Baby, when you never come around
Every day that you keep it away
It only makes me want it more
Ooh baby, just say the word
And I'll be at your door

What more do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

Ever since I met you, baby
There's been somethin' inside of me
That keeps me wantin' you
Baby, won't you set me free?
Take off these chains, girl
And I'll take off yours
There's no one in the world, baby
That I wanna love more

What else do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper everyday
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
And I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(In love)
I'm drownin' baby, in my love foy you
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
I just don't, I don't know what to say

In love
In love
Oh baby-girl, you're takin' me away
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby
In love
In love
