
U say that u love me like river
A river u say'll never run dry
I'd rather hear u say 4 ever
Instead of a smile I'd rather see u cry
Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)

Baby, take a real good look at my face
Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe u should have played an ace
Instead u played the queen
U'd be better off cheatin' than tryin'
2 read my mind

Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)

Love me 2 the (9's)

Stay awake 4 4teen hours
Listen 2 the band play New Power Soul
We got 2 get with this
Dancing 2 the beat 'til we lose our mind control

Can I get a witness?
I'm lookin' 4 a lover with a body that says some mo'
I want 2 see the booty boom before I even let
Her get close enough 2 smell perfume
I'm lookin' 4 a PhD
Ass piled high and deep u see
I can't help it - like a honey 2 a bee -
If the booty boom she gonna go with me
And then T. will whip out a 37 questionnaire and
Machine gun a sister like he just don't care
Machine gun a sister like he just got 2
Just got 2, just got 2 - hit it

Then how u gonna make that booty boom?
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"

"Step back, give a girl some room"

Yo, check this out
Would u hug me on a crowded street?
Could u keep your cool if I washed your feet?
U soul a bath
What if I gave it, your body I ask
How long would u save it?
Could u lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink your ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other
Instead of smilin', would u cry?
Could u kiss 3 times with your dress upside
Downstroked and laughin'
Would u stay awake 4 4teen hours
Listenin' 2 the grass grow?
I ask thee would u, could u,
Would u love me 2 the 9's (I'll love u 2 the 9's)
Would u, could u,
Will u love me for all time? (I'll love u 4 all time)
Would u, could u,
Will u love me 2 the 9's (I'll love u 2 the 9's)

Wanna be loved, sugar (love 2 the 9's)
Wann be loved 4 all time (love 4 all time)

Love me 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)

I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
