"Welcome, U've got mail"
(Computer) [sample repeats in BG]
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

Nothing on TV I ain't seen before
Another murder on the news, I can't take no more
Evil Incorporated, blowing up bombs and thangs
I have a child, huh, I have a lot 2 explain
I could write a letter, but who would I send it 2?
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

I called an old friend of mine just the other day
No congratulations, no respect paid
All she did was wonder if the rumors were true
I said - "No, I ain't dead yet, but uh.. what about U?"
I can count my friends with a peace sign: 1, 2
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright (Oh)
I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life (A better life)

I got no mail, my computer

I told them I don't wanna see a doctor unless he's lonely 2
Every Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Make believe it's a better world (Make believe it's a better world)
A better life [x52]

"Goodbye"
