Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! [x2]

Can U take me home
Where we can be alone?
Can U make me happy
Till my pain is gone?
Can U get me excited?
Excited enough 2 thank the God above 4 the human body

Yeah, yeah, yeah
4 the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Can U get me excited
Till my love is long?
Can U let me ride it (Oh yeah)
Till the early morn'?
Can U freak me dirty?
Freak me till I thank the God above 4 the human body

Yeah, yeah, yeah
4 the human body

(Slave!) [x4]
