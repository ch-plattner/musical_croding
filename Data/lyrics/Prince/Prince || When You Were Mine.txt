
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a dream
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency 
To change the sheets

Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love u, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (so blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping inbetween the two of us

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
U were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more that I did
When you were mine

When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine
