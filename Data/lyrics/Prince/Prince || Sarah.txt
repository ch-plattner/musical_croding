What a night, what a city
Girl, U sho' is lookin' pretty
Tryin' 2 catch a cool one
Checkin' 4 a little fun

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that U?
Is that U, baby?

Got yo' good shoes on
Ribbon in your hair
That skirt ain't talkin' 2 long
I can see your underwear

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that U?
I think it's U, baby

Hey!

Girl, I hate 2 be the one
2 tell U that your day is done
U best 2 get your shit and go'n
Or Tina won't be alone
I'd never raise my hand 2 U
No tellin' what my foot'll do
Ah, I'm kiddin' baby, that's a joke
Maybe I just got my heart broke
There's only one thing left 2 do

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that U?
Is that U?

Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Ow! Ow! ...

Is that U, baby, is that U?
I think it's U

(Good, one more take)
