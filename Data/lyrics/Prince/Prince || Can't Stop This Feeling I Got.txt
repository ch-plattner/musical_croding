Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them 2
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode

Everybody wanna see u down 4 the count
But that ain't what being a real man's about
The brave and the bold hang around 4 the kill
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it (fill it!)
They can hit us with all they got
But cha know what?
What?

I can't stop this feeling I got
I feel it right down 2 my toes
I can't stop this feeling I got
My body got 2 have it u know
I can't stop this feeling I got
I'll write a letter to the whole world
I can't stop this feeling I got
Every man, woman, boy and girl

Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got

I can't stop this feeling I got
U know I can't sleep at night
I can't stop, u know I love it a lot,
I'm talking about an everlasting light.
I can't stop this feeling I got
I get to shaking all in my shoes
I can't stop this feeling I got
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do

Can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
Keep on singing now

Can't stop. try 2 tell me how 2 paint my palace,
That ain't where it's at,
That's like trying 2 tell Columbus that the world is flat.
If the song we're singing truely is the best
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test
All in favor say Aye.
We can change anything at all.

I, I, I can't stop. can't stop.
I'm in a butt kicking mood tonight ya'll
Can't stop. can't stop.
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
(no, no, no, no)
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!
Hey, pardon me 4 living, (pardon me 4 living)
But this is my world, (this is my world)
U can't make me change (u can't make me change)
Maybe we all got to rearrange (rearrange)
Our brains (our brains)

Yeah. Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world

1, 2, 1, 2, 3
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, yeah!
Yeah!
