There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served
They say that u ain't u know what
In baby who knows how long
It's hard 4 me 2 say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong

Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
Gett off - I'll only call u after if u say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - I u want 2 baby here I am (Here I am)

I clocked the jizz from a friend
Of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said u told her a fantasy
That got her all wet (Wet)
Something about a little box with a
Mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
I knew that we could slide

Gett off (Gett off)

1 2 3 - Nah, little cutie, I ain't drinkin' (Gett off)
Scope this, I was just thinkin'
U + me, what a ride
If u was thinkin' the same
We could continue outside (Gett off)
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
Strip your dress down
Like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Lemme show u baby I'm a talented boy

Everybody grab a body
Pump it like u want somebody

Gett off (Gett off)

So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (G-G-Gett off)
In my paisley crib
Whatcha want 2 eat? "Ribs"
Ha, toy, I don't serve ribs...
U better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when u sat down

Honey them hips is gone
That's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of something James used to say...

"I like 'em fat"
"I like 'em proud"
"Ya gotta have a mother for me"

Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight your a star
And I'm the big dipper

(Kick it)
