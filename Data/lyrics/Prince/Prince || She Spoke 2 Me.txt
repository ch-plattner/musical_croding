
Spoke 2 me
I can't believe it, but she spoke 2 me
Close 2 me
I never thought I'd get her close 2 me

Now the moon and the sun belong 2 me
All my wildest hopes, my crazy dreams
But they seem more like reality

Fantasy
This girl fulfills my every fantasy
She must be
Specially designed by heaven just 4 me (Just 4 me)

My friends look at her, they see mystery
But I look at her and I see a masterpiece
Can it be, I mean really did she?

Spoke 2 me (Spoke 2 me)
I can't believe it, but she spoke 2 me (Speak 2 me, baby)
(Speak 2 me, baby)

Spoke 2 me
I can't believe it, but she spoke 2 me
And if she hurts me
I'll take it all with open arms U see (U think I won't?)

Cuz like a track under a subway train
She could roll all over me and I'd still be the same

Cuz 2day is the day she spoke 2 me
I can't believe it, but she spoke 2 me
Close 2 me
I never thought I'd get her close 2 me

If I'm stuck in some groovy wet dream
Don't pinch me
I don't wanna wake up
I'm diggin' the scene (I'm diggin', diggin')
Yeah, baby
