The way u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

I got a jones, Martha
Oh yeah, it be like this (I can't have a hug)
I can't have a hug (unless)
Unless I have a kiss

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

Like a wildcat, Martha, in a celibate rage
I want your love, in my dirty little cage
Can u understand, Martha?

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

2 night we video...
No one will ever know
We'll erase the naughty bits
I'll show my...
If you show your...
I can't help it, Martha {'insatiable' repeated in the background}
I can't help what u do 2 me
U are my every fantasy
There's no telling how far I'd go
Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

Please, baby, don't say no
Cuz I'll surely go crazy
OK, so all u do is push the little red button...
And I belong 2 u and your little video box

Hey - don't look at the clock, yeah
It's 2:45, we got all night

First u gotta tell me what u want me to do

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u
There's no tellin' how far I'd go
Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do u really want all my clothes off? (yes)
What are u gonna do to prove it?
Aren't u afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the show
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what 2 do
Have u done this before? (I don't know)
U say u want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
I don't know, I don't care

(My body, baby, u truly do)
I know I could be nasty with u

(Up and down, just like a seesaw) ((back and forth))
(back and forth)
Listen (oh girl, I'm fallin')
I love u, baby

I love u baby, you're mine
U're nastier than I thought
It's just 2:49...
