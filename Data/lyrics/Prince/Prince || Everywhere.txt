"There's a place I want 2 go
Where the milk and honey flow
Without God it wasn't there
Now I feel it Everywhere"

When I was lost and couldn't c my way
I used 2 follow what everybody say
Now I know that it's written in the heart
Now I'm ready, ready 2 start

Without God it wasn't there
Now I feel it Everywhere

We were always meant 2 b
In paradise eternally
B4 the truth I did not care
Now I feel it Everywhere

Feel it, feel it Everywhere
Feel it, feel it
Can u feel it?
This might good feeling Everywhere
We've got so much work 2 do.Everywhere
