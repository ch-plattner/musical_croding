
Don't play me
I'm over 30 & I don't smoke weed
I put my ass away & music I've played
aint the type of stereo U're tryin to feed
Don't play me
Don't play me
I use proper English & I'm straight
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend
And not the type of ganda U prop in my way
Don't play me

Don't play me
I've been to the mountain top & it aint what U say
Don't play me

Don't play me
I'm the wrong color & I play guitar
My only competition is well in the past
Time & time if time existed movin ever so fast
Don't play me

U couldn't play enough of me now
2 make me feel like a star
Don't play me I already do in my car
Don't play me

Don't be mad at me
The curtain puller in the game
Maybe how U call us Niggers aint the same
It's all good when u know the only fame
Is the light that comes from God & the joy U get to say his name
Don't play me

Don't play me
I've seen to the mountain top & it aint what U say
Don't play me

Already got laid
