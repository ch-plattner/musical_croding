
Using a special code he accessed his mind
In search of the reason why
In passion and fashion he began travelin' time
3rd eye, 3rd eye, 3rd eye

The serpent approves
Then appears between Adam's thighs
And he tries 2 release upon Eve the nectar
The injector tries
He tries, he tries, he tries

So abduction complete
All stand on their feet
Look at one another and cry

What have we done?
Could this be the fun
On the dotted line 4 which I did sign?
Oh yeah

I resign from the notion
Cuz yours was the potion
That I'm supposed 2 die 4
I resign

In self-pity so dark
This shitty and stark
Realization is all that will soothe

Ultimately the only one
That can save U is U
Your God is inside and 4 that God U will do
Whatever it takes
If nothing else is true
The only one that can save U is U, yeah

(Shoobedoop)
