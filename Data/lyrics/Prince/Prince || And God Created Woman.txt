
In a deep sleep I fell
And the music starts 2 swell
One of my ribs He took and it shall be
Bone of my bones (bone of my bones)
And God created woman
And we were naked and did not care
There's a time 2 take and a time 2 share
2 in love, all around and all aware
Flesh of my flesh (flesh of my flesh)
And God created woman

Temptation sweet and so much (sweet and so much)
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch (shall ye touch)
Then again we could die from the rush (rush)
Heart of my heart (heart of my heart)
And God created woman (woman)

Woman
My-my-my-my-my-my woman

In my darkest hour I find
Many serpents who have lied (lied)
Given half the chance still I'd run 2 your side (run 2 your side)
Love of my love (love of my love)
And God created woman (woman)

And if I never see u again
It's alright 4 I am guilty of no sin
They can have u, I'll have your love in the end
Soul of my soul (soul of my soul)
And God created woman

(God created woman)
(God created woman) (woman)
Flesh of my flesh
(God created woman) (soul)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created woman)
