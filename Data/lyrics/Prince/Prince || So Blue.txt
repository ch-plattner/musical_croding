I had everything I needed
But now my life is so blue
You meant the world to me
But now you're gone and I'm so blue

Even though the sun is shining
I spend my day, I spend my day crying over you
Oh yeah, I spend my day crying over you
I feel just like the sky, oh, so blue

Oh baby, don't you know?
Baby don't you know?
I spend my nights, it's all alone
Talking to myself, I am so blue

And everyday the feeling gets stronger
And who's to say, just how much longer
I can spend my nights all alone

Talking to myself and just crying over you
I guess I'll just spend my life
So, so blue
