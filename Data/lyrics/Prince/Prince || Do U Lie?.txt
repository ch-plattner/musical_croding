[Translated: The children who lie don't go to paradise]

(Ok) Ok, Merci

When I lie awake in my boudoir I think of u dear
Do u think of me, or do u lie, do u lie?
When I'm in a sad and lonely mood dear, I cry 4 u dear (I cry 4 u)
Do you cry 4 me, do u cry, do u cry?

When I need someone 2 talk 2, u're not around
When I need another human's touch, I wear a frown
'cause u're uptown
Going down, going down, going down

I, I, I don't lie to u (i i don't lie)
When I say that I'm in love mama (mama, mama)
I feel so good when u're near (mama, mama)
Tell me do u feel it 2
Do u lie, do u lie? (or do u cry)
Do u cry from the inside out dear
Or are they only artificial tears? (artificial tears)
Do u really mean it when u cry,
When u cry, when u cry?

When I need someone 2 talk 2, (do u lie)
u're not around (u're not around)
u're not around (I wear a frown)
When I need (tell me why)
another human's touch,
I wear a frown (tell me why u wanna go)
Cause u're uptown (and leave me all alone)

Going down, going down, going down (goin' down)
Going down, going down, going down (down, down, down)
Going down, going down, going down (down, down, down)

When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of u)
I think of u dear (do u)
Do y'all think of me,
Or do u lie, do u lie?
