[crowd noise]
Mmm-mmm!
Oooh-wee!
Fellas would U look at that thing
Have U ever...?

U just got back from Paris
U probably went to buy some clothes
U're on your way to Nell's in New York
Gonna meet who? Heaven knows

But it ain't about where U're comin'
It ain't about where U go
It ain't about who U've been with
'Cuz it ain't about who U know

It's about that walk - can we talk about it?
It's about that walk - I wanna shout about it

Oooh-wee!

Your ass like a fine cut diamond
Mounted on 2 legs of stone
The prison I could do some time in
If I ever got that ass alone

But 4 now I'll just keep my shirt on
'Cuz I ain't about losin' cool
['Cuz it] ain't about losin' sleep, 4 that matter
Baby, that nothin' that I do

It's about that walk - I wanna talk about it
It's about that walk - I wanna shout about it

Oh-wee
Oh yeah baby
(Anything else let me do that work, shake it) (Ooh)

Mmm, mmm-mmm!
Fellas have U ever...?

It ain't about where U're comin'
It ain't about where U go
It ain't about who U've been with
'Cuz who U know

It's about that walk, yeah - I wanna talk about it
Baby, baby, baby about the walk - ooh shout about it, shout about it

Oooh-wee!
Oh Lord, Lord
Girl U know U got the walk
Girl U know I got the talk
Run

Lord I mercy...

Eyh!
Keep playing
Ugh!
Vegas on a C
Ooh-(wha-wha...)
Remember 'bout that ending?
On the one
Ugh!
