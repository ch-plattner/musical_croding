
It's only been a hour since U left me 
But it feels like a million days 
If Eye had a magic wand eye could turn back time 
Eye'd never let U go away 

Eye didn't have the heart 2 say eye'm sorry 
Now eye haven't got a heart at all 
Eye could tolerate the pain if eye could talk 2 my best friend 
But U won't even call 

Eye'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase 
And packing everything eye own 
Eye didn't back then but eye do know now 
Wherever U r is home 
Eye'll crawl on my belly and beg U 
But Ur so far away 
U've only been gone 4 an hour 
But it seems like a million days 

It's only been a hour since U left me 
Eye wish eye had somebody 2 blame 
But Ur the perfect picture of what love should look like 
And eye wanna b Ur frame 
It's only been a hour but it feels like a million days 

A million days 
One hundred thousand million days 
Come home, come home baby 
Eye can't take this no more 
Well, come home baby oh yeah 
Baby, eye know eye shouldn't put my faith in heroes 
But eye can't c U any other way 
It's only been a hour since U left me girl 
Feels like a million, feels like a million days 

Come home baby
