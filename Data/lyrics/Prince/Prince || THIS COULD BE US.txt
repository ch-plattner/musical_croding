Naw... U ain't ready (no you ain't ready)
I mean ready 4 us.

U know u want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be us
But u b playin'
This could be us
But u keep on foolin' around
U're the cage 2 me dove
I'm just saying
Forever and ever in love
Oh baby yeah, this could be us.

U know u want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be... us
This could be us

U... u say u ain't ready
Ready 2 go steady
Ain't ready 4 'us' (no)
Cuz what I got make u weak in in the knees
Take your energy (oh baby)
make u sleep 4 a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it metaphysically

This could be...us
This could be us
This could be...us
This could be us

I...I know u're loving your freedom
Cuz yo freedom (freedom) is payin' yo bills
Yes it is
Boyfriends, u think u don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think u will, sho' u right

This could be us "yes"
But u b playin' (oh yeah...)
This could be us (you sho' nuff could be)
But u keep on foolin' around

We...we come up on a crossroad
And we got 2 decide (deside)
Which way 2 turn,
which way "yes" which way 2 turn
Are we gonna go (Are we gonna go) 
Go (Are we gonna)
Over the bridge... Over the bridge 
(Over the bridge) before, before it burns
Don't u let it burn, let it burn, baby

This could be....us
This could be us (oh yeah)
This could be...us
Oh u gotta stop playing' baby

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That a woman needs love (L-O-V-E love)
Like a river flow, like a river flow (inside)
If its good that's all she thinking of

(Metaphysical cookie licking dream)
Sleep alone if U wanna 
(nothing mystical, let me lick your kitty clean)
But like a new pair of shoes
(& after that, U can put me on my back)
U gonna wanna show me off 2 your friends
(Look 4 candy in my purple psychedelic pimp sack)
When I ....ooooohhh...

This right here, this could be us
This could be
This could be us (oh yeah)
but you be playing (yes you do now)
This could be us (honey,honey, honey)
But u keep on foolin' around
See that U're the cage to me dove
I'm just saying (I'm just saying)
Forever and ever in love
Oh Baby yeah, this could be us.

This could be...us
This could be us
This could be (This could be us)...us

This could be us

This could be us

Can't u see it baby
U're the cage to my dove
Only one I been dreaming of
Forever and ever in love
Ohh baby yeah, 
This could, this could be.. 

This could be us
But u don't...have.... Time.....4....me.....no.....more.
