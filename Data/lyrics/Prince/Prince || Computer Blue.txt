Is the water warm enough?

Where is my love life?
Where can it be?
There must be something wrong with the machinery

Where is my love life?
Tell me, tell me
Where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Until I find the righteous 1
Computer blue
Until I find the righteous 1
Computer blue
