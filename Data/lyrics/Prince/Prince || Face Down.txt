Check, check, 1 2, check
U know what he's sayin'?

Face down! [x2]

Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?
Thinkin' all along that he wanted 2 be rich
Never respected the root of all evil and he still don't 2 this day, huh
Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?

Face down! [x2]

Told 'em he wanted 2 sing a song about a black child goin' buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk 2 your lawyer but U got no case
What U need 2 do is keep your place
Next time U pull a card, it better be a ace motherfucker
Or U can lay face down (Face down!)

1 2
Face down! 1 2

Horn [x2]
Bass [x2]

Him and her meaning who I'm singin' about
And his psychoanalyst kinda saw the catalyst
As the devil with the blue jeans on, huh
Ain't it kinda funny when U see the dawn?
Sign the name they gave ya
But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, U're what?

Face down! 1 2
Face down! New Power Generation in the house, bury 'em all
Face down! Yes, oh Lord
Face down!

Orchestra [x3]
Face down!
Orchestra
Face down!

It's in his will, I read it
He shot 2 kill, he said it
4 those who know the number and don't call
Huh, fuck all y'all

Face down! [x3]
