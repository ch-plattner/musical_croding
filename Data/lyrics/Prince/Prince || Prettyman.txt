Hey now - what's up?
Ah, you know 2 come over here
Staring at a brother so hard
Say U what?

If U wanna be my baby
Got 2 tell me so
Overconfident lady
Better act like U know
If U wanna be my baby
Come on, take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with...
A prettyman

See me up here dancing ...
Dancing on the blow
Got 2 do about doing
Just a little more
Where I wear my knickers
Round this booty tight
Make a sucker gonna call me up
Every night
Hey

If U wanna be my baby
Got 2 tell me so
Overconfident lady
Better act like U know
If U wanna be my baby
Come on, take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with...
A prettyman

Everywhere I go
People stop and stare
They just wanna see me swing
This pretty hair
What ever comfort up
Just want grow
Like my brother
Buy some more

Prettyman (Prettyman)
Begin

In the early morning
When I'm feeling nice (Prettyman)
I walk by the mirror
And kiss it twice (Prettyman)
When it cover perfume
It's on the shelf
I get it down
Hit me, your body around
I, I, I smell myself

Hey
Now
Prettyman
Do U...
(Prettyman)
I ain't U
See out
Prettyman
Come on band, break down (Prettyman)
I don't care about money
I buy gold by the once
Y2K not today
I write a check and the bank bounce

Superbowl used 2 be my nickname
If U ask about love
No money might guarantee
When I'm a bow

Pretty
Man

If U wanna be my baby
Got 2 tell me so
Overconfident lady
Better act like U know
If U wanna be my baby
Come on, take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with...
A prettyman
