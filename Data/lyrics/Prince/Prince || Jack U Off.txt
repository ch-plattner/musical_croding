If u're looking for somewhere to go
Thought I'd take u to a movie show
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack u off
I can't give u everything u want
But I can take u to a restaurant
If u're not hungry
I'll jack u off

If your man ain't no good
Come on over to my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack u off

If u're tired of the masturbater
Little girl, we can go on a date
And if u like, I'll jack u off

I'll jack u off, jack u off
I'll jack u off, jack u off
I'll jack u off

I only do it for a worthy cause
Viriginity or menopause
U'll have an instant heart attack if I jack u off

If u really really want to be a star
We gotta do it in your momma's car
Naked in a cadillac, I'll jack u off

If we can't find no place to go
Girl, I'll take u to a movie show, we can sit in the back
And I'll jack u off

I'll jack u off, jack u off
I'll jack u off, jack u off
I'll jack u off, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'll jack u off

Alright say, we'll put some funk on here
I'll jack u off

If u ain't chicken baby, come here
If u're good I'll even let u steer
As a matter of fact, u can jack me off
Yeah, that's right

I'll jack u off, yeah
I'll jack u off
