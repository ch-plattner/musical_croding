Say its about time
About time that u
R around

I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u

Alone with u

I think I'm running out of patience
I think I'm running out of lies
I think its 'bout time I tell the truth
Instead of these alibi's

Well...
I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u
Cuz ure so fine
When I get mine
Baby u can too

No more peace and quiet
I wonder why
A party full of drunken fools
I betcha some will b the rushing tide
Splashin all over u

I don't wanna work another day baby
No no stay with me
I wish u coulda stay with me
Stay with me
I don't think it matters anyway
It don't matter girl
For u I'm as rich as I could be
Baby baby

I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u
I know u know
Cuz ure so fine
When I get mine
Baby u can too
Sho 'nuff

Sugar well I'm thinking
That u really need 2 b my pet
And let me put u in my little cage
C'mon
Im sick and tired of playing hard to get
With an animal that's half my age
Sugar well well
My heads a little dizzy
My heads spinning 'round and 'round
Another dirty hotel room
Another lonely town

I need some time to rest?
I need some time with u

This is what it feels like

I know what I wanna do

This is what it feels like

Gonna lemme tell u one time

I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u
Cuz ure so fine
When I get mine
Baby u can too

Oh oh I think I need u 2 b my girl
Travel with me around the world
Baby baby
So no paper
This works out fine
But not half as fine
As when I get time
With u

Sugar have u heard

I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u
Cuz ure so fine
When I get mine
Baby u can too

Keep breakin u down.

Down down down

I think its 'bout time
That I got time
Alone with u
Cuz ure so fine
When I get mine
Baby u can too

U, u, u, u

Baby baby u can to!

Ooh ooh oh...
