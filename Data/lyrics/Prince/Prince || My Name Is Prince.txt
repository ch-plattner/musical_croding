My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only
I did not come 2 funk around
'Tll I get your daughter I won't leave this town
In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous I know from sin
I got 2 sides and they both friends
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much too fast
If u try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When u hear my music you'll be havin' fun
That's when I gottcha that's when u mine
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me (You can't stop Prince)

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody) (Prince)

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
Cuz I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2 day?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than u
But if u want 2 play with me, u better learn the rules

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
I did not come 2 funk around (You can't stop Prince)
'Till I get your daughter I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this - leave this - leave this

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, some....)

The funkier I be
The funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric
A new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this u're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D.I.C.K.
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was 2 big 4 u anyway
U're just a simpleton
I'll bust u like a pimple, son
My star is 2 bright
Boy, I'll sink u like the ship Poseidon Adventure
U're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
There must be more coming from
Your mouth than manure.
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
U must become a prince before u're king anyway

(Do that, do that somebody)
(Do that, do that somebody)

It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
U've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
In my cauldron. That means my nugget...
Sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin'
The other brothers buggin' and this is 4 those who oppose
And propose 2 overexpose disclose
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let u play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do u expect 2 win when u're used to playing craps?

(Do that, do that somebody)
Hell yeah, let's get this under the hmm...
(Do that, do that somebody)

"Damn." It's gettin' tricky
I mean it's a sticky situation
2 resurrect a groove with feeling
And give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party
While u're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
2 layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out...

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only

My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince

My name is Prince
