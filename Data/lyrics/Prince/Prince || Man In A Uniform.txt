She said - "Man in a uniform
2night that's what I want U 2 be"
She said - "3rd time this week U wore that old suit
But I don't give a damn, U see?
Because man in a uniform do funny things 2 me"
And I said - "It's the 3rd time, but I don't mind
Cuz that sister just so damn fine, ah"

Man in a uniform (Hut!)
That's what I am
Man in a uniform, uh

She said - "Man in a uniform
Sufferin' every stroke of my hand
From the dusk until the early morn'
U will grant this girl's demands" (Why?)
Cuz she need 2 be drunk with pride
Wait a minute, I'm go'n tell U why
2 make up, 2 make up...
2 make up 4 the emptiness that she feel inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on

Man in a uniform, mama
That's what I am (Hut!)

Man in a uniform
She said - "2night (2night)
I want your attention" ('tention)
She said - "2night I want your violent tongue
2 swallow my stench and be loyal 2 me
She'll never be free
Until U do me like a man in a uniform" (Hut!)

Man in a uniform (in a uniform)
That's what I am
In a uniform (Baby, baby, yeah)
That's what I am
Dirty little man in a uniform
That's what I am (Hut!)
