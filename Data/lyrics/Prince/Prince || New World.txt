
New world [x4]
When the sharpest vibration
Saves U from obliteration
The intelligence of your bed reacts
Covering U head 2 toe with an air-filled sack

When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love 4 one another - New world
Love 4 one another - New world

When U wanna find some isolation
But the tracker U got from vaccination (Keeps playin')
Keeps playin' - "U'll never walk alone" (Over and over)
They're always listening, especially on the phone

When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love 4 one another - New world
Love 4 one another - New world

Wait a minute
New world

Did U hear about the new pill? It feels like sex!
Guaranteed 2 thrill with no ill side-effects
A pill that will stop the wrinkles, a pill that will stop the pain
A pill that will make a baby never seek political gain
What's it all 4 when U can alter biology?
Who or what, then my friend, will U and I be? [x2]

When the sharpest vibration
Saves U from obliteration
When the melting pot stirs, how U gonna take it?
When U can't tell him from her, how U gonna fake it?

When the lines blur every boy and girl
How U gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love 4 one another - New world
Love 4 one another (How U gonna take it?)
(How U gonna fake it?)
Love 4 one another (How U gonna take it?)
(New world) New world

New world
