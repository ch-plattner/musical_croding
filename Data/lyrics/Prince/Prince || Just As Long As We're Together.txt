
You can live your own life and I'll live mine
I will never try to keep you down
And even if I only see you some of the time
I'm just happy when you come around
And even if the sun don't shine

I'm warm enough when
You're in these arms of mine
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Nothing that will break us apart
Girl, I gotta always have you in my ear
Gotta always have you in my heart
Oh baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine

Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, there's nothing better
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doing what you what me to
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing that melody, sugar

Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright

Don't you know there ain't better oh
