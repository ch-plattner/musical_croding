
I've heard it said my lovers look alike
Could it be that I was looking 4 U
They were cool but something wasn't right
They had me fooled 4 a minute and then I saw the truth

[Chorus]
None of them got what it takes
2 B a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
2 keep your man
Show me 1 of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama

I've heard it said that I won't treat U right
(U know that ain't right babe)
But they ain't sure 'cos they don't know nothing about U
(U know what U want baby)
U're too secure to ever want to fuss and fight
(That's right)
That's why Ur man never ever got a reason 2 doubt U

[Chorus]

Yeah I know U might be fine but I've seen it all before
Cinderella was a waste of time and oops she's out the door
To build a house together the thing that matters more
Is under the floor
A strong foundation that last forever more

I want to make you happy, baby,
(Oh yes)
Happier than happy itself
(Oh yes)
U know what?
If you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help
'Cos I got U, anywhere U wanna go, uh
(Oh yes)
Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, U C,
I know what U want,
What every good woman wants
A man so in love with you
He can't help but to flaunt U
Deep down I know what U want
You want your girlfriends to hate U
'Cos they can't get Ur man

[Chorus]
