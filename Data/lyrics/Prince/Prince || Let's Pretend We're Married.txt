2 help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me
If you r go let's come see what we can see

Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free 4 a couple of hours (Free 4 a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
Say, let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
All the hippies sing together

Excuse me but I need your chemistry
Don't you wanna be my fantasy?
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did - So what? C'mon baby, let's b-b-ball

Ooh little darlin' if you're
Free 4 a couple of hours (Free 4 a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
Oh I say let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
All the hippies sing together

Let's just pretend we're married, tonight

Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
2 help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Let's pretend we're married and do it all night
I won't stop until the morning light

Let's pretend we're married and go all night
Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free 4 a couple of hours (Free 4 a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
Oh darlin', let's preted we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won' stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight
(Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah)
Pretend we're married

Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah

Yeah, yeah
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did - So what? C'mon baby, let's ball

I wanna fuck you so bad it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna fuck you
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna wanna, I wanna fuck you
Look here Marsha, I'm not sayin' this just 2 be nasty
I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth
Can you relate?

My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did - I wouldn't care. Let's ball

Whatever you heard about me is true
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with God, he's the only way
'Cuz you and I know we gotta die some day
If you think I'm crazy, you're probably right
But I'm gonna have fun every motherfuckin' night
If you like 2 fight, you're a double-drag fool
I'm goin' 2 another life, how 'bout you?
