Temptation
Lust
Pop go mama

Everybody on this earth has got a vice
And mine, little darlin', mine is the opposite of ice
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
In other words, this little prince thinks a lot about U, see?
Baby, baby, baby
I'm guilty in the first degree

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Everybody in this room
Everybody in this room has got an urge
What's yours, baby?
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Pop go mama when daddy gets a little 2 much
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Purplelectricity whenever our bodies touch
Ooh baby, I love it when our bodies touch

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation, temptation, temptation

Wait a minute now

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation
Working my body, working my body, working my body

Temptation
I'm not talkin' about just ordinary temptation, people. I'm talking
About the kind of temptation that'll make U do things.
Oh, oh, temptation.
Oh, darling, I can almost taste the wetness between your...
Temptation, temptation
I'm not talking about any ol' kind of temptation, people, I'm talkin'
About, I'm talkin' about... sexual temptation.
A lover
I need a lover, a lover, I need a...right now.
U, I want U.
I want U in the worst way.
I want U.

"Oh, silly man, that's not how it works.
You have 2 want her 4 the right reasons."

I do!

"U don't, now die!"

No! No!

Let me go, let me go.

I'm sorry.
I'll be good.
This time I promise,
Love is more important than sex.
Now I understand.
I have 2 go now.
I don't know when I'll return.
Good-bye
