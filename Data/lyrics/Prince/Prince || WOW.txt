You're lookin' so fine. No, it's true.
Remember the time we first met?
You think that was good?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

[Chorus]
Like a bee to some honey; a moth to a flame.
You got an addiction and you got me to blame.
You never saw it coming 'cause I make no claims 'til now
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it... wow!
You can call it call it... wow!
You can call it call it call it... wow!
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it call it call it call it...

Sorry, I don't know what came over me.
The cycle of the moon affects the motion of the see what you did.
It's starting all over again.
We both want it now more than we did back then.

[Chorus]
Like a bee to some honey; a moth to a flame.
You got an addiction and you got me to blame.
You never saw it coming 'cause I make no claims 'til now
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it... wow!
You can call it call it... wow!
You can call it call it call it... wow!
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it call it call it call it...

Gimme a minute.
Let me get myself together.
I'm never really out of control.
Really, I'm so much better.
Maybe it's your eyes, your stare lookin' like...
Lookin' like you wanna go somewhere.
You wanna go somewhere?

Something about the wild in me; it's never tame.
I think we're both alike; this is how we became.

[Chorus]
Like a bee to some honey; a moth to a flame.
You got an addiction and you got me to blame.
You never saw it coming 'cause I make no claims 'til now
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it... wow!
You can call it call it... wow!
You can call it call it call it... wow!
You can call it the unexpected or you can call it call it call it call it...
