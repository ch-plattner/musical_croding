NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now!
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now!

Once again I don't follow trends, they just follow me
Just like the Israelies thru the red sea
It might take U some time but U will want 2 see
The undisputed truth and get free (Get free)

NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Live)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Come on)
(Get free, yeah!)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Go, come on)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Once again)
(Backwards: the uncredible)

At the very core of thinking I originate
That's why U'll never know my thinking or my fate
Invisible - unless of course U R my mate
If not, U think U see me - I disintegrate
Disintegrate my thoughts from yours
U can feel me coming outa everyone of your pores
We're integrating where I am understood and adored
"U're just 2 my subject - that's y U're outtatouch!"
So what's this claim - out of what?
My dear, I am the touch

Oh, hear me, feel me
Oh, hear me, feel me
Come on
NPG (Get funky)
[...]
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now!

I can give U power (power), I can take it away
I can make U dance, cuz this guitar I play
Heavy rotation (Come on, come on)
Never made my world go 'round
Commercialization, commercialization of the music
Is what brought it down

(Overhere)
(2 the bridge)

My level is now what U must learn 2 rise above
Talk to D'Angelo or better yet - ?uestlove
It might take U some time but U will learn 2 see
The undisputed truth and get free (Get free)

NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Live)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Come on)
(Get free, yeah!)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now!
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Once again)
(Backwards: The Incredible)
(Get free, yeah!)
NPG (Feel me) get rowdy (Love me), get rowdy now! (Horns)
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now!
Get funky

Funky
NPG - new power (Chuck)
There's no rasism (14)
Free nation (Funky)
Free nation (Funky)
Check it
(Undisputed!)

Come on, come all 2 the download ball, off
There's no curfew 2 hurt U - no substitutions
School's now in session
Put down the Smith & Wessons
Real renegades don't invite grenades 2 make the grade
This is a brain raid - who rise above the lies
Raise above these days
New ways disguised as a craze
Uh, gotcha back against the status they thrown at us
Back against the wall again
High trees catch a lot of wind, oh
Last band standing
Gotta knock my overstanding
According 2 planing (NPG get rowdy)
And look up in the sky
No cable wire
God bless the child
God bless the child

(So funky)
Ha-ha-ha-ha ...
