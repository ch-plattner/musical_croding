
What's wrong with the world 2day? 
Things just got 2 get better 
Show me what the leaders say 
Maybe we should write a letter 

Said Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand 
Why poor people keep struggling but U don't lend a helping hand 
Matthew 5:5 say "The meek shall inherit the earth" 
We wanna b down that way 
but U been trippin since the day of your birth 

Who said that 2 kill is a sin 
Then started every single war that Ur people been in? 
Who said that water is a precious commodity 
Then dropped a big old black oil slick in the deep blue sea? 

Who told me, Mr. Man, that working round the clock 
would buy me a big housed in the hood 
Cigarette ads on every block 
Who told me, Mr. Man, that Eye got a right 2 moan? 
How about this bog old hole in the ozone? 

What's wrong with the world 2day 
Things just got 2 get better 
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand 
Maybe we should write a letter 

Listen, Ain't no sense in voting - same song with a different name 
Might not b in the back of the bus but it sure feel just the same 
Ain't nothing fair about welfare 
Ain't no assistance in AIDS 
We ain't that affirmative about your actions until the people get paid 

Ur thousand years r up 
Now U got 2 share the land 
Section 1 - the 14th amendment says "No state shall deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property, without due process of law" 
Mr. Man, we want 2 end this letter with 3 words 
We tired a-y'all
