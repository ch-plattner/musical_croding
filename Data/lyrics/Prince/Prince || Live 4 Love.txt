Lauch procedure commence

10,9,8,7,6,5,4

Keep goin'

Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...

30,000 feet and still-a-counting (live 4 love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live 4 love)
They killed my buddy, but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love

Kicked out of my home at 17 (live 4 love) ((get outta here))
A real family,
Now what does that mean (what does that mean) (live 4 love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - Calling, I'm calling
Live 4 love

My mission, so they said, was just 2 drop the bombs
Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...
Just like I got no conscience, just like I got no qualms
Alpha 7, acknowledge
Now what does that mean?

Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching

"Live 4 Love, without love u don't live"

Boom - I take a deep breath
Is it boom - life?
Is it boom - death?

(live 4 love)

Maybe I was better off staying in school (live 4 love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live 4 love)
It's so easy 4 them 2 say
Cuz they never have to go through

How can I live 4 love? (live 4 love) I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love
Live 4 love

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live 4 love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live 4 love)
The choice u make is vital
So at the end of my recital
I say - U got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

Keep goin'

Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love), (live 4 love)
Live (live 4 love)

Live 4 love, without love u don't live
And how u make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations,
The cards have always been stacked against us (live 4 love)
2 love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Beleive me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And gangk any clown who ain't down
With the colors that u're sportin' 'round
Listen G, u are supposed 2 be strivin'
2 be the best that u can be
So stop tryin' 2 dominate and push and shove (live 4 love)
C'mon y'all, we got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)
