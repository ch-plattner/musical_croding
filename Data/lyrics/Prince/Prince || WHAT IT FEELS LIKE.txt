U use 2 treat me like David, but now I feel like Saul
Been making it rain all around the world
What difference does it make when the boy ain't got his girl?

This is what it feels like [x2]
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]
This is what it feels like [x2]
This is what it feels like, babe

Ur name's not David and it sure ain't Saul
Maybe U have no business writing on my wall
Springtime on the Philistines b4 the middle of the fall (Middle of the fall)
Silly rabbit needs 2 stop doin' tricks if U wanna get my call
(If U wanna get my call)

This is what it feels like [x2]
(This is what it feels like, babe)
This is what it feels like, baby
This is what it feels like [x2]
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]

Everybody goes up and down in a lifetime love affair
Makin' up, just breakin' up and pullin' each other's hair
What I wouldn't give 2 have U right here next 2 me
Show U want I really feel about U, well listen and U will see

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]
This is what it feels like [x2]
Yeah
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]

The art of seduction, U and me is the right equation
And all U need 2 reach my lovin' is why I stared down a muffin
I can't wait 2 be Ur baby... baby, here I am... just take me

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, baby
This is what it feels like [x2]
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe [x2]
