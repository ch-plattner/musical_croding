Wherever U go, whatever U do
Oh please, remember that I'll always be there 4 U
U don't have 2 call, U don't have 2 say
Just think about me and I'll be on my way
I don't have 2 worry, I'm sure U'll be fine
Cuz if U stay happy, then what's your's is mine
Wherever U go, whatever U do
Remember that I'll always be there 4 U
(Oh Baby)

Wherever U R, think of your dreams
Oh please, remember life ain't always what it seems
4 each rainy day (rainy day)
That comes your way
The sun will come shining and U'll be okay
Keep on smiling - every girl and boy
Remember when U were children U had toys
Wherever U R, think of your dreams
Remember that dreams become the life U lead

Whatever U play, it's okay 2 lose
Ooh sometimes (sometimes...)
As long as U learn from every game U choose
If one thing is sure, U'll always endure
If U try your best at everything U do
Say what U mean and mean what U say
The price 4 a broken heart - it's 2 much 2 pay
And nothing is worth it, if U don't have 2 try
The higher the stakes - the higher the sky

Wherever U go, whatever U do
Please remember
Remember that I'll always be there 4 U
