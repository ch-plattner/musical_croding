Come here, baby
Come and get your come on
Oh, I see this is what U wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got 2 be) I got 2 be up on it
If I want 2 make U mine

This is something every girl should know
Every part of U comes alive when U take it slow
And every nervous twitch that happens when my tongue is there
Your lips, up and down your back and every single hair
It all makes up the beauty of your grand design
Every man has got a duty, and 2night I want 2 do mine

(Oh, I see) Oh, I see this is what U wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got 2 be) I got 2 be up on it, yeah
If I want 2 make U mine

This is something every man should see
Give your woman what she wants and give her what she needs
(What she needs [x3])
Ask her in a whisper that only 2 can hear
What can I do, what can I say, baby? Forget your every single fear
Slowly I pull your strap down and touch U as if 2 heal (heal)
Layer by layer, inch by inch, until your true love is revealed

Oh, I see, ooh, this is what U wanted, baby
One kiss at a time
I got 2 be, I got 2 be up on it
If I want 2 make U mine

If every man could love their woman the way that I love U
Time would stop and the sky would fall
And all could see the glory of what true love can bring
That's what I sing
Oh, I see

(Oh, I see) Mmm, this is what U wanted
One kiss at a time
I got 2 be on my knees, I.. I.. I.. I gotta please
If I want 2 make U mine

Only, only, only way 2 get your come on, all night long
One kiss at a time (And I know that's right)
(I gotta stay) I gotta stay, [good and long] (Now come on)
On this Valentine

Come on (Come and get your come on)
Get your come on, baby
One kiss at a time
Come on, baby, let's get this on
One kiss at a time
Uh huh, yeah
One kiss at a time [x2]
