2 sevens together 
Like time, indefinite 
Trying 2 catch the glass 
b4 it falls 
Without a frown 
Can U turn up the stereo? 
Eye wanna play U this old song about love (is it about love?) 
Can Eye do that? 

Did we remember 2 water the plants today? 
Eye 4got 2 look up at the moon because 
Eye was 2 busy, said Eye was 2 busy 
Eye was 2 busy 
Looking at you babe 

Still it's nice 2 know 
That, uh when bodies wear out 
We can get another 
What does that 1 thing have 2 do with the other 1? 
Eye don't know 
Eye was just thinking about my mother 

U know what 
Turn the stereo back down 
Ain't nothing worse than an old worn out love song 
Tell me do you like my hair this way 
Remember all the way back in the day 
When we would compare who's afro was the roundest 

Mirrored tiles above the bed 
Fishing nets and posters all over the wall 
Oh yes, sometimes 
Sometimes Eye just wanna go sit out on the stool 
And uh... play my guitar 
Just watch all... all the cars go by...
