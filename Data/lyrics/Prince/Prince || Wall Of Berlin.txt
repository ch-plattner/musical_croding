Where am eye? 
In a universe of paradoxical design 
Reality o merely in the mind 
In my head or in some german town 
She said "u want a 4 leaf clover 
In the round?" 
Ain't superstitious 
And eye don't believe in luck 
But eye heard the thunder 
B4 the lightning struck 
Couldn't read the writing 
Cuz it was so small 
But according 2 the document she got on the wall 

She gets down like the wall of berlin 
Eye come round about a quarter 2 ten 
We just met or at least we pretend 
It's so fresh knockin' down 
The wall of berlin 

Where am eye? 
A galaxy of monumental delight 
Or parallel hologram copyright 
The call comes unexpected 
Like a mugger in a park 
And the sound of the train interrupts the ? 

Is that the queen of sheba 
Or an alien dream? 
The marks on the table say 
Somewhere in between 
Not one 4 rituals 
But one thing eye have found 
Everything's better when you come around 

She gets down like the wall of berlin 
Eye come round about a quarter 2 ten 
We just met or at least we pretend 
It's so fresh knockin' down 
The wall of berlin
