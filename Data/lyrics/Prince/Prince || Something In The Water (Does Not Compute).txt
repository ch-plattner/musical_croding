Can't figure out why U make me beg
Does not compute (Does not compute)
Don't not compute (Don't not compute)
U think you're special, well so do I
Why do special women make me cry?
Does not compute (Does not compute)
It don't not compute (Don't not compute)

Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water they drink
'Cuz why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad?

Some people think I'm kinda cute
But that don't compute when it comes 2 Y-O-U
It don't compute (Don't not compute)
Somethin' mama don't compute (Don't not compute)
What's the hangup? What's the scam?
Guess U think I'm just another 1...1 of your fans
It don't compute (Don't not compute)
Somethin' honey don't compute (Don't not compute)

Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water U drink
'Cuz why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad?

I've got 2 get 2 U, baby
Some people think I'm kinda smart
Why must a fella stop with U before he starts?
It don't compute, mama (Does not compute)
Somethin' don't compute (Don't not compute)
I'd buy U clothing, buy U fancy cars
But U gotta talk 2 me, baby, tell me who U really r

Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water U drink
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad?

(Must be something in the water U drink)
(Does not compute)
(Don't not compute)
(Don't not compute)
(Must be something in the water U drink)
Bitch - U think you're special? (Must be something in the water U drink)
So do I
(second coming) (Must be something in the water U drink)
Why in God's name
Do U wanna make me cry?
Why? Why? (Must be something in the water U drink)
I'd do anything 4 U, anything (Must be something in the water U drink)
Why don't U talk 2 me? (Must be something in the water U drink)
Tell me who u r (Must be something in the water U drink)
Don't do this 2 me (Must be something in the water U drink)
Please don't do this (Must be something in the water U drink)

Why? Why?
I do love U. I do.
Or else I wouldn't go through all the things I do
