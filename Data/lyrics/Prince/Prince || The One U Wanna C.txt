
I know I ain't the first to tell ya
I sho bet I won't be the last
I know Ur in a hurry baby
So let me make this fast

[Chorus]
I got a lotta money
I don't wanna spend it on me
I like pretty thangs
U're just as pretty as U can be
So if U ain't busy later
And U want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
I'm the one, the one, the one U wana C

Look around U baby
U know U've seen it all before
Every nickle in this club lookin 4 a dime
Nothing less nothing more

2 tall 2 be talked down 2
2 over it 2 be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I came like thunder to tell U

[Chorus]

U don't need 2 fix ur hair
4 somebody U don't care 4
U don't need 2 shave Ur legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at Ur door
I know U ain't a concubine
I know U ain't a 1 nite stand
I don't wanna waste Ur time
If U wanna get creamy
I'm the one U wanna C

Oh the one U wanna C baby
Oh the one U wanna C
I'm the one U wanna C
[repeat]

Coming on U like thunder
I'm the one U wanna C
