Top of the road
Latest fashion
Happy, don't U know?
Here I am in New York, yeah
See the girl bold and fair ("Yo, Anita!") [Martin sample]
What's in your backpack 2day?
Will it take my blues away?
That's OK, "U gotta run..."
Huh, check it, I don't need U 2 have some fun
Comin' from the land of snow
I guess I'm kinda used 2 cold

But one day I'll have a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm gonna wear the latest fashion
I'm gonna be happy, don't U know?

I could use a new guitar
Sing a tune at Chazz' bar
Maybe meet a debutante
Be a toy, do what she want (Tell me what U wanna do?)
9 o'clock, see John K.
"But U don't rock, come another day" (When?)
Come another day
Spirit so low reachin' up 4 ground (Reachin' up 4 ground)
One day I'm gonna make it in this lonely town

Then I'll live in a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm gonna wear the latest fashion
Then I'll be happy, don't U know?

Hey there, what's your name? (What's your name, cutie?)
And can U tell me how 2 play the game? ("I am a winner") (Listen 2 this)
Do I really have 2 cut my hair? (No)
Now, that's a cross I could never bear (How 'bout them publishing rights?)
Sell my publishing? What a laugh! (Ha ha)
I don't know Bo, but I do know math (I do know math)
Back 2 Minneapolis, there U go
U can't find your house underneath the snow

Cuz U're livin' in a big white mansion (Oh yes)
At the top of the road
U're wearin' the latest fashion
Tryin' 2 be happy, don't U know? (Tryin' 2 be happy, happy)

Big white, big white mansion (Big white mansion)
At the top of the road
U and me wearin' Versace, Gucci (Latest fashion)
Hoochies, they all wanna do me (Happy, don't U know?)
But am I really happy?
Big white mansion
Yeah, maybe one day
