I'm going down 2 Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head 2 my feet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes she will
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird (My daddy's thunderbird)
A white rad ride, '66 ('67) so glam it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her 2 ... Tennessee

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tennessee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, drive her

Excuse me, baby
I don't mean 2 be rude
But I guess tonight I'm just not, I'm just not in the mood
So if U don't mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would like to...watch

Yeah, yeah, yeah...can I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Can I, can I, can I, can I)

We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
2 make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day

Yeah, yeah, yeah, better days
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's O-O-K
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe it's the only way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cat, we need U 2 rap
Cat, we need U 2 rap
Don't give 2 us slow
Cause we know U know
New Power Soul
Gotta gotta gotta go!

Talk 2 me lover
Come on tell me what U taste
Didn't your mama tell U
Life is 2 good 2 waste? (Put your love down)
Didn't she tell U
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If U can hang, U can trip on it
U surely won't fall (Put your love down)
No side effects and
The feeling last 4-ever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes U feel clever (Put your love down)
U kiss your enemies
Like U know U should
Then U jerk your body
Like a horny pony would (Put your love down)
U jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!

And while U're at it tell your papa about this

Yeah-yeah

Put your love down there when u wanna get shot

No! (Yeah, yeah)

Put your love down there when u wanna get shot
Put your love down there when u wanna get shot
Put your love down there when u wanna get shot

Put your love down there...

Get home, Alphabet Street
