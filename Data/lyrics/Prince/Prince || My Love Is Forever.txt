
You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time
(All the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just hard to be

You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you
(Need you)

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever

Sugar, I don't have to dream
'Cause you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
(Love you)

Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
Never, never stop wanting you
Never, never get enough of you, love is forever

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, my love is forever
