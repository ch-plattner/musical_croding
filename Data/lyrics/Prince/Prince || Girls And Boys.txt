He only knew her 4 a little while,
but he had grown accustomed 2 her style
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
He did 2, they were meant 2 be
They loved 2 kiss on the steps of Versailles
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly
I love u baby, I love u so much,
maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy,
vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

He gave her all the love that anyone can,
but she was promised 2 another man
He tried so hard not 2 go insane

Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy,
vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
