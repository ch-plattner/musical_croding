
And now I'd like 2 turn your heart 2 a tale of sheer delight
A song of adulation, love and fear
No one loved him better, no one better sacrificed
She gave her angels that summer night

Fate as she designed it took her from her man
Destiny and love don't always go hand in hand (Hand in hand)
As the world lay waiting like an embryo in a womb
She gave her angels that night in June (She gave her angels)

She gave her angels 2 a man because her man had none
2 watch over him till she returned - her man, her lover, her son
Her father 4 all these things he meant 2 her, she felt it right
She gave her angels that summer night [x2]
