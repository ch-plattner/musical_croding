Get your groove on
I got some money cuz I just got paid
It's time 2 get my groove on
Been workin' hard, now it's time 2 play
I gots 2 get my groove on
Can't wait 2 see your face again
U keep me happy, yeah, U're my best friend
In The Park around a half past 9
Meet me, we'll have a real good time

Come on, everybody get your groove on
Come on, we gonna party all night long
Get your groove on

I got some honey and some peppermint tea
That's all I need 2 get my drink on
Don't want this night 2 end if U're with me
We gonna party all night long
Bring the player, I'll bring the CDs
But don't U put nothing slow on
That new D'Angelo, some N.P.G.
And we'll make a bet 2 see who keep their clothes on

Come on, everybody get your groove on
Come on, we gonna party all night long
Get your groove on

I'm usually workin' both night and day
No time 4 fun
But 2night I'm gonna get my groove on
I'm sayin' 'til I see the sun
Till I see the sun, ooh, I wanna play

Come on!

Speak
Hey girl, let's hang 2night
Alrighty
Around a half past 9?

I got some money cuz I just got paid
It's time 2 get my groove on
Been workin' hard, now it's time 2 play
I gots 2 get my groove on

Come on, everybody get your groove on (Hey baby)
Come on!
Get your groove on

Get your groove on

Hey, nice joint, huh?
It's alright
U see anything U like in here, U know what I'm sayin'?

But there's 2 much smoke in here, ehh
Wait, wait, wait

Get it on, get on
Get your groove on
Baby, get your groove on

Girl, U believe that brother that came over here?
I'm tellin' U, with a tooth missin' and everything
Hey Rhonda, girl, how U doin'?
Hey, how U doin' Montalbo?
Is Juice in there?
Don't U mean...

The sleazy one?
Yo, I know Big Juice is in there, girl

Gettin' that groove on (Get your groove on)
(Getcha, getcha, get your groove on)
Oh, get it on

Girl, I think we better leave
Cuz if we don't, I think I might have 2 have another one
Then I might change my name
2... ?
What's my name? Margarita

Y'all help me find Juice, I'm tryin', I can't find him
Are U still lookin' 4 him?
Yeah, he's just... U know
He's up in here somewhere, I can't find him though
(No no, definitely not seen him)
Girl, let's go, I smell like an ashtray
(It's time 2 go)
We ain't goin' nowhere

Sir, I'm sorry
This club has a very strict dress code
We do not accept bluejeans

What U mean?
It don't take Stevie Wonder 2 see I got on the right clothes in here
I need 2 get up in this club
Hell, I could buy every one of ya
Fuck yourself!
