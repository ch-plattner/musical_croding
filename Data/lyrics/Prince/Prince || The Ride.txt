
If U got the time, baby
I got the ride
If U got the time, baby
I got the ride
Where I wanna go
Keep U satisfied

If U like it real slow, baby
I got days
If U like it real slow
I got days
But if U wanna take the short cut
I know the way

If U like 2 be alone
I like 2 watch
If U like 2 be alone, baby
I like 2 watch
But if U want some good lovin', baby
I'll give U all I got
All I got

If U got the time, baby
I got the ride
If U got the time, baby
I got the ride
Where I wanna go, girl
Keep U satisfied

If U got the time, baby
I got the ride (Vegas)
