I've held your hand so many times
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
I've kissed your lips and laid with you
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms
I guess my eyes can only see as far as you
I only want to be with you

We've come so far in so little time
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I only want to be with you

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I always, always want to be with you
