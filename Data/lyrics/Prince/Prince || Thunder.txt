Thunder - all thru the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight

Oooo - Thunder
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Love - nobody know just how it was born
Love - first came to me with the radio on
Jumped up in my body with an attitude
Kissed me on the mouth and said "Your leader take me to"

'Twas like thunder all thru the night
And a promise to see jesus in the morning light
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Love's kiss was running all thru my veins
The bed started shakin', I don't know who to blame
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Is this my sweet savior or the devil in disguise

'Twas like thunder (oh) all thru the night (all through)
Promise to see jesus in the morning light
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Thunder - hey hey
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(it was truly truly)
Like rain falling on a window pane
Tears came to my eyes when I asked her name
Made me holler when it finally came
Said "Only the children born of me will remain"

'Twas like thunder all thru the night
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light (mornin' light)
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Thunder

It will be all right (all right)
(it was truly like thunder)
Don't do it like that, do it like this
Oh oh (thunder) oh oh (thunder) oh ohhhhhh

Thunder (thunder)

(thunder)

(it was truley truly like)

Like thunder (thunder) all thru the night (thunder yeah)
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light (it will be all right)
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright (it's gonna be alright)
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Ooooo Thunder
Thunder, thunder yeah yeah yeah
Thunder
Ooooo thunder

Ooooo Thunder
Ooooo Ooooo thunder
