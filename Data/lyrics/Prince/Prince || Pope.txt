(You don't understand)
(I ain't scared of you mutha fuckas)
(Kick it)

(Stir it like coffee)
The Pope
(Stir it like muthafuckin' coffee)
The Pope
(The hell)
This is the Pope

Oh, your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock to the bee that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame

Put me on a slow movin'
Parliamentary hackin' bandwagon
You could put me little ass in the grave
Everytime you want it I'll be live, bring a date
I mean computer when it's over press save

So you can be the President
(You can be the President)
(Kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope
(Rather be the Pope)
(I'd rather be, so happy)

Yeah, you can be the side effect
(You can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope
(Rather be the dope)
(I ain't scared of you mutha fuckers)
(Kick it)

Call your girl named Sally
And you figure you were chill
(Chill)
Then you find out
I'm the reason Sally's on the pill
(Pill)

What am I supposed to do
When the President can't get nothing passed
Find an alley, find an alley
Undress Sally right in front of your ass
(Well, she helped me once again)

I say you can be the President
(You can be the President)
(Kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope
(Rather be the Pope)
(I'd rather be, so help me)

Yeah, you can be the side effect
(You can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope
(Rather be the dope)
(Fuck that)
The Pope
(Oh, no motherfucker, not today)

Pope, you can be the President
(Rather be the Pope)
So help me

Who's the funky drummer
With the crooked little sticks
(Sticks)
He might have better luck
If he was drummin' with his dick
(Dick)

If you don't play the piccolo
Why you wanna lick?
(Ch-check)
Now check the drum solo
And tell me not to kick it
(Seek and destroy, it'll fuck you up)

I love the taste of unpredictable licks
A loop is a loop is a loop
A loop is a loop is a loop
(Fuck that)
A loop is a loop, is a loop, is a loop
Is a loop is a loop is a loop

Your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock to the bee that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame

Put me on a slow movin'
Parliamentary hackin' bandwagon
You could put me little ass in the grave
Everytime you want it I'll be live, bring a date
I mean computer when it's over press save

So you can be the president
(You can be the President)
(Kick it)
I'd rather be the pope
(Rather be the Pope)
(I wanna be, so happy)

You can be the side effect
(You can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope
(You, you, you)
(You can be the dope)
The Pope

You can be the President
Rather be the Pope
Baby, so help me please
Press save, I love you peace
(You don't understand)
