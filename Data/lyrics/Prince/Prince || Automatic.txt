'Cuz every time U leave me, I die, that's automatic 2
U ask me 2 forgive U, when U know, I'm just an addict
So stop the music baby, U know, You're all I wanna do
Hey
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what 2 do
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with U

U ask me if I'll kiss U, it's automatic
And if U cry, me cry, boo-hoo, that's automatic 2
I would never leave U, no matter what U do
Stop the music baby, U know, I'm an automatic fool
Hey
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what 2 do (And don't stop)
A-U-T-O-matic, oh, I'm so in love with U

I'll rub your back forever, it's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll look 4 a needle in a haystack, that's automatic 2 (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll go down on U all night long, it's automatic,
(I will, yes I will babe)
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong,
That's automatic 2 (A-U-T-O-matic)

A-U-T-O-matic

C'mon baby
A-U-T-O-matic, tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with U

Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love
I only pray that when U dream, I'm the 1 U dream of
I pray that when U dream, U dream of how we kissed
Not with our lips but with our souls
Stop me if I bore U
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can U hear me? Why do I love U so much?
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around U when I'm naked,
Can U hear me?
I wonder if U have any mercy, don't torture me

Stop the music baby, automatic fool

When it comes 2 U I'm automatic baby
There's no 1 else like me
I'm the best you'll ever find
No 1 else could understand U, you're 2 complex
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know U
That's automatic 2
Can U hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)
Yes, I'm addicted 2 your pleasure
I'm addicted 2 your pain
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
Automatically insane
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
Hey (A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
Hey
Fasten your seat belts
Prepare 4 takeoff

(I remember how U kissed me)
(Not with your lips but with your soul)
(With U I'm never bored, talk 2 me some more)
(I can hear U, I'm going 2 have 2 torture U now)
