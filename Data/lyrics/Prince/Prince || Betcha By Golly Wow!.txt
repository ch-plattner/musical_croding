Candyland appears each time U smile
Never thought that fairy tales came true
But they come true when I'm near U
U're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise and...

Betcha by golly wow! (wow!) (wow!)
U're the one that I've been waiting 4 4ever
And ever will my love 4 U keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

If I could, I'd catch a falling star
2 shine on U so I know where U are
Paint a rainbow in your favorite shade
2 show I love U, thinking of U

Write your name across the sky
Anything U ask, I'll try cuz...

Betcha by golly wow! (wow!) (wow!)
U're the one that I've been waiting 4 4ever
And ever will my love 4 U keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Betcha by golly!
U're the one, yes U are! (Don't U let 'em tell U otherwise)
And ever will my love 4 U keep growing strong!

Baby, sometime
A man can't find words 2 express all the things he feels inside
But every just so often
The words of another who's truly in love seem 2 work out fine

2 say I love U (I love U)
2 say I'm thinking of U!

Betcha by golly wow! (wow!) (wow!)
U're the one that I've been waiting 4 4ever
And ever will my love 4 U keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

U're the one I'm thinking of, thinkin' of
Ever will my...
And ever will my love 4 U keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

I love U, baby
