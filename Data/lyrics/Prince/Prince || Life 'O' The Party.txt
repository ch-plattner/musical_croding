
This is the life o' the party 
We gonna do it right 

So Ur havin' a party? 
Goody 4 U 
All the beautiful people gonna b there? 
Yeah, that's cool 
U know Ur gonna have a good time cause U got the news 
That the life o' the party is gonna party with U 

We're doing our own thing 
Until the sun'll come up 
Sweet Candy gonna b there 
Yeah, it's gonna b rough 
She ain't got no off switch 
And neither do eye 
When U read it in the paper 2morrow 
U gonna hang Ur head and cry 

[Chorus]

We gonna have us a party 
All r welcome 2 
We ain't down with nobody 
That don't party like we do 
Once we get it started 
We got 2 go all night 
This is the life of the party 
We gonna do it right 

Why party in your own yard 
When U can party in mine? 
All the beautiful people gonna b there 
Puttin' the "I" in fine 
Throw the records out my window 
CD's out the door 
Might as well give it 2 the milkman 
We don't want it no more 

Everybody can smell this funk y'all 
Down in Altanta GA 
Everybody, even Dre and Em, know it's OK 
Hey, we don't need any trippin' y'all on this special day 
We just callin' 2 let U know 
U better not come if U can't stay 

[Chorus]

What's it gonna take 2 get Ur booty soakin' wet? 
U and me closer baby, that's a bet 

Eye'm the life of the party 
As long as eye got your body 
Shakin like a leaf on a tree 
Cutie come dance with me 
U and me, we got mad chemistry 
Don't it make U wanna holler? 
Come with the life of the party, y'all 
We're still makin dollars 
25 years 2 life 
The judge sentenced me 2 hard labor with a knife 
Making cuts 4 y'all 
Keeping the party packed and wall 2 wall 
Eye don't care what they say 
"He don't play the hits no more 
plus eye thought he was gay" 

But it ain't nothing if it ain't fun 
My voice is getting higher 
and Eye ain't never had my nose done 
That's the other guy 
All the purple hippies bang your head on the 1 

[Chorus]
