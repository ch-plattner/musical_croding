If the wind blew every petal from your precious red rose
Would U be afraid of what U'd find inside?

When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U
When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U
And every time I do what I need 2 do
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U

Revolving around every word that is spoken
Like the planets around the sun
I want U
Your tongue is a great persuader
Yeah, U got me sold
And when I'm alone in my room just watching a rose
I dream about U, I dream about U

When I'm alone in my room, yeah
I can't stop dreaming about U
When I'm alone in my room, baby, baby
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U
And every time I do what I need 2 do
I can't stop dreaming about U, dreaming about U

When my sane twin reigns
Claiming your aim is 2 maim my subconscious into being with U
I dream about U
Betting on the notion that if my lustier twin prevails
Like the ruins of Rome, I'll lie helpless at your feet
Yeah, when I'm alone
I dream about U, I dream about U

I dream about U, baby
When I'm alone in my room
I dream about U, my baby
I dream about U, U, U

(And here we stand)
And here we stand amidst your core (U)
Like the petals on this rose I adore (U)
The inside (The inside)
If the inside is kind
Kind in a sense that one would come from all
And the wish that U wish will come true if U call
But if not, (U will fall) U will fall
And I'll still be alone (Just dreaming about U)
With this ball in my stomach just dreaming about U (Dreaming about U)
