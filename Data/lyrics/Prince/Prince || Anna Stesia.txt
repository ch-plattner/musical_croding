
Have U ever been so lonely
That U felt like U were the
Only one in this world?

Have U ever wanted 2 play
With someone so much U'd take
Any one boy or girl?

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way...
So I danced

Music late, nothing great (Music late, nothing great)
No way 2 differentiate (No way 2 differentiate)
I took a chance

Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips 2 say

"We could live 4 a little while
If U could just learn 2 smile
U and I could fly away, fly away."

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps U could show me, baby (show me, baby)

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
If I was just closer 2 somethin' (closer)
Closer 2 your higher self
I don't know
Closer 2 heaven (Maybe) closer 2 God (closer to God)

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget that U are the rule
U are my God, I am Your child
From now on, 4 U I shall be wild
I shall be quick I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story, no matter how long (no matter how... no matter)

We're just a play in Your master plan
Now, my Lord I understand

(I understand)

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
[repeated over chorus]
