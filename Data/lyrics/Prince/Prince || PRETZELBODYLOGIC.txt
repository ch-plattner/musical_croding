Dreamin' of each other
On each others tongue
Taste the bittersweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Wake up

Hear the plane hummin' back on the run
One hour of sleep between 'em Better than none
Promoter tried to rob her We said, "go 'head son!"
Cuz we both too sleepy
To get the gun

Pretzelbodylogic is so much fun
Dreamin' of each other
On each others tongue
Taste the bittersweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Banks on holiday credit's overrun
Somebody else's problem
Too tired for another one
Pull the shades hunny
Black out the sun
I need a little more rest
Then we'll do what needs to be done

Pretzelbodylogic is so much fun
Dreamin' of each other
On each others tongue
Taste the bittersweet undone
Now we both to sleepy to get the gun

Limo on the tarmac ready to ride
Cutie pie driver said,
"Get inside!"
Another limousine about to get a load
Put your seat back now its 1, 2, 3 for the road

Pretzelbodylogic is so much fun
Dreamin' of each other
On each others tongue
Taste the bittersweet undone
Now we both to sleepy to get the gun

Pretzelbodylogic is so much fun
Dreamin' of each other
On each others tongue
Taste the bittersweet undone
Now we both to sleepy to get the gun
