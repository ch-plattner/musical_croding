
Oh well, here we are again
Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
I tell each and every one of my friends
That the love we make is really pretty rude
But they don't believe me cuz it's written all over my face
Like Evian and the deep blue sea
U and me got different taste
U like it in the dark but I like a
Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then everything will be Alright
Oh, Blue light

U say u wish I was shy
I always take a simple thing and push it way 2 far
But baby, that's the problem with u and I
U say not in public but I say in the car
Say, we need to get wild again like it was when we first met
Close your eyes and count 2 ten and when u open 'em -
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on

Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then everything will be Alright
Oh, Blue light

I'll be 117
U'll be still sayin' "Baby not 2 nite"
It's easy 2 see us on the cover of a magazine
"Double heart attack, couple both die in a fight"
Oh Baby! I don't wanna cross that road cuz I love u 2 much
I'd do anything just 2 heat up your cold touch
Anything I would do, but up until u tell me 2

Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then everything will be Alright
Oh, Blue light

Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light (cuddle up 2 me)
So tight
Cuddle up next 2 me baby
U and me all night, alright Blue light
Light (u turn on a) Blue light
And every thing will be Alright
Oooh Blue light
Blue light
Blue light
Blue light
Blue light
Blue light
