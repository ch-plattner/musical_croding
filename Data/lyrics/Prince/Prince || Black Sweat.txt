
I don't want to take my clothes off
But I do
I don't want to turn nobody on 'less it's U
I don't want to dance too hard
But this is a groove
I'm hot and I don't care who knows it
I got a job to do

I'm workin'
Workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin'
Workin' up a black sweat

I don't want to break your pride
But I got to
You better take your woman and hide her
'Cuz I'm about to
Show you what's really good
Break you off like you knew I would
I got a brand new dance
And it's called the ...

Workin'
Workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin'
Workin' up a black sweat

You can act hard if you want to
This groove will make you sweat
You'll be screamin' like a white lady
When I count to three

Work little sister, work
Work little brother, work
I don't want to do nothin' crazy
But I do

I'm workin'
Workin' up a black sweat
