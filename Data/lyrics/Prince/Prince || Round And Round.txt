Oh yeah
Round and round and round
Round, round
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah

Can u tell me where we're going 2?
Can u tell me what it is we really want 2 find?
Is the truth really there? Or is it right under our hair?
4 all we know it's been there all the time.

I say, nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Round and round. We go round and round and round.
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found

Can u tell me when we gonna get 2 it.
I'm tired of fooling around I said I wanna do it. (go 4 it, get 2 it)
I learned my lesson young, I said if want to have fun (go 4 it)
And when u win say, "I knew it" (go 4 it, get 2 it)

Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Round and round (get get get get 2 it, go 4 it, get 2 it)
We go round and round and round.
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found

1 day I'll make it in the big city
And I'll be looking 4 a girl who's pretty
1 day I'll make a play and she will say ok
'cause I plan 2 be a cool kitty

Round and Round.
I say, nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Round and round. We go round and round and round.
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found
Round and round we go. Round and round we go.
Round and round and round and round and round and round we go.
Round and round, round and round,
Round and round we go, round and round we go
Round and round.
