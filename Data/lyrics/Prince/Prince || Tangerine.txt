
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I feel blue
Some days I just wanna black out
Everything I felt for U
Even though I take your picture
Everywhere I go
I use it for a coaster and drink the overflow

Some days I make a lot of money
And give it all away
2 take my mind off the tangerine colour
Of your negligee
Beggars can't be choosy
If they don't know how 2 serve
U got a different phone number
...and a lot of nerve

Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I miss U, 2
