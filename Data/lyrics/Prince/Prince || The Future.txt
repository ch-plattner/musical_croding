I want you to tell all your friends about me."
"What are you?"
"I'm BATMAN!"

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spiritually
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Yellow Smiley offers me X
Like he's drinking seven up
I would rather drink 6 razor blades
Razor blades from a paper cup
He can't understand, I say 2 tough
It's just that I've seen the future
And boy it's rough

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So U can't go like a jerk
No, no

I've seen the future and it will be
Wait a minute

Pretty pony standing on the avenue
Flashin' a loaded pistol, 2 dumb 2 be true
Somebody told him playin' cops and robbers was cool
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
If there's life after, we will see
Don't go out like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spiritually
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be

"Think about the future"
