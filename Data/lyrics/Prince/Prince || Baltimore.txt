[Eryn Allen Kane:]
Baltimore

[Prince:]
Nobody got in nobody's way
So I guess you could say it was a good day
At least a little better than the day in Baltimore
Does anybody hear us pray
For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?
Peace is more than the absence of war
Absence of war

[Prince & Eryn Allen Kane:]
Are we gonna see another bloody day?
We're tired of the cryin' and people dyin'
Let's take all the guns away

[Prince:]
Absence of war, you and me
Maybe we can finally say
Enough is enough, it's time for love
It's time to hear
It's time to hear the guitar play, guitar play
Baltimore, ever more

If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace

[Prince & Eryn Allen Kane:]
Are we gonna see another bloody day?
We're tired of the cryin' and people dyin'
Let's take all the guns away

If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
