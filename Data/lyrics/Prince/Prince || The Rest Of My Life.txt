Don't look now but there's another rocky road
Another heavy "Why?" of the much 2 heavy, heavy load
But 2day I'm gonna face it, yeah, cuz I'm sick of dealin' any other way
Nobody said the race was fair but I'm gonna keep runnin' just the same

2day, 2day is the first day of the rest of my life

Don't look now but here comes another heartbreak
Benefit of the doubt I'll give it, control of my life I've gotta take
Cuz I'm alive and that's reason enough 4 me 2 bust a smile
I've arrived and now I wanna stay 4 a little while

Cuz 2day, 2day is the first day of the rest of my life

Let's go

2day, 2day is the first day of the rest of my life
2day, 2day is the first day of the rest of my life
