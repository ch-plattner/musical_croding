This house of ill-repute (Ooohh honey I'm scared of u)
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
I guess this is what u get 4 being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder you're all alone
It's written all over your face
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place

Here comes a lady so u cover up
She's a freaked out,
Funky electric mama with double cups
Say u, u could cop if u wanted 2
Because something near your leg
Is haunting u, such a disgrace
U're rock hard in a funky place, ow!

Rock hard in a funky place

U was workin' on the line
U could drop on her
But u couldn't concentrate
When your dick saw her
Maybe if u cop a nut in the car (Maybe if u cop a nut in the car)
Maybe u could think
About playing guitar

(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Oh yeah

Rock hard in a funky place

All you're looking 4 is love
Or a reason 2 believe there's a God above
Pretty soon you'll get enough
And head back 2 a life so tough
I just hate 2 see an erection go 2 waste
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place
Say it
Rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Oohh U rock hard in a funky place
U rock hard in a funky place
Say it, y'all

(rock, rock)
what? (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We gotta go, y'all
tune in next week (rock, rock)
Same time (rock, rock)
same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
oohhh yeah (rock, rock, rock, rock)
we will rock, y'all (rock, rock)

But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger

(What kind of fuck ending was that?)
