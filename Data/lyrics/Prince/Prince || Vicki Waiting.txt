phonebook..."

The phone rings, it's Vicki callin'
She wants me 2 come 2 the crib
She says conversation's better than being lonely
So I try my best to ad lib
I told the joke about the woman
Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
He replied "I didn't know I was playin' in a cathedral."
Vicki didn't laugh at all.

[Chorus:]
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting...
Alright

All is well in Gotham City
The sound of terror is all U hear
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body
Sometimes her body's here
But U see when crime is your only love
All that matter is the present, the here and now
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat
Is whatever this joker will bang

[Chorus]

Oh yeah

Talk of children still frightens me
Is my character enough 2 be
One that deserves a copy made?
This I one day, hope 2 see
Until then she's held at bay
By my animal-like persistence
Or maybe she's just 2 proud 2 say
That fate (fate) brought us together
And this is where she wants 2 stay

[Chorus 2x]

All is well in Gotham town
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I've never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting (waiting)
Aha aha

Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting

This is where she wants 2 be
