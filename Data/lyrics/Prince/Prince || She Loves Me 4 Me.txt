
With this one I can b what I wanna b
I don't have 2 live up 2 no one's fantasy
I could write another 300 melodies
2 her it's just 3, cuz this one.
She Loves Me 4 Me

With this one I don't even have 2 comb my hair
I can wear what I want 2
Or nothing she don't care
I don't even have 2 take her on the rollercoaster c
Cuz this one, She Loves Me 4 Me

In the morning,
When I rise and c her eyes
Look deep in2 mine
I find a better place

This one I can tell all my secrets 2
I don't have 2 make her swear she would never tell anywho
Besides I'm the only one she ever wants 2 c
Cuz this one, honestly, She Loves Me 4 Me

When the night falls
And she calls
I run 2 her side
Cuz she got the ride I like 2 ride

This one I can take over my momma's house
And I don't have 2 worry what goes in and out her mouth
All she needs is a little gratuity
She don't like no beef, she just loves me 4 me
This one, She Loves Me 4 Me
