Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
(Bitch) [Fishbone's "Lyin' Ass Bitch" sample repeats throughout song]
What if I called U silly names
Just like the ones that U call me?
What if I filled your eyes with tears
So many that U cannot see?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)

(Billy Jack Bitch)

What if I told U that U're worth
Only half of what U be?
Would U come forth and tell no lies?
Would U come forth and talk 2 me?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)

(Billy Jack Bitch)

What distortion could U let your pen forget 2day?
What misfortune left your heart so broken U only say
Words intended 2 belittle or dismay?
What if I say U lie?
Billy Jack Bitch (Well)

Open letters aren't the only things that open wounds
Long hard shiny rocket ships can fly U 2 the moon

Whenever evil wants 2 groove
Come let me fly U 2 the moon
Then U can see how love will bloom
Joy - it's in the dictionary
See "J" Billy Jack Bitch

Do U ever really cry? (Do U ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do U ever really try? (Do U ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do U ever wonder why? (Do U ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?)
Oh, Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy, Billy, oh yeah yeah yeah!

(Do U ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
(Do U ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?) Cry, cry
(Do U ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?) Try, try
(Billy Jack Bitch) Billy, Billy, oh

(Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
(Billy Jack Bitch)

Uh
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
Yeah, uh
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack) [x2]
(Billy Jack Bitch)
Solo with that on there

(Billy Jack Bitch) [x2]
Please access another experience
Please access another experience"
(Billy Jack Bitch)

Ha ha ha ha ha
Y'all some tight motherfuckers
