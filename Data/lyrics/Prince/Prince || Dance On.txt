
Oh, pick it up!
There's a bass guitar in this

Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky
Tell me how many young brothers must die

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

Little Talk Johnny blew the big score
The gang nailed his feet 2 a wooden floor
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They all know the words but the music is doomed

Everybody
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Pick it up
Dance on, dance on

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

A bass guitar in spider webs, longing 4 the funk
Uzi gun takes his place in a wagon trunk
(get off me, punk, U ain't sexy)
Stealin' ladies purses then settin' them a'flame
M&M killers playin' Mickey Mouse games

Lord have mercy
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)

It's time 4 new education
The former rules don't apply
We need a power structure that breeds production
Instead of jacks who vandalize
Detroit - what's happenin'?

What color is your money today? [this is sung in a round]
Get your money straight
Everybody dance on
