Tell me how some people walk in the sun
While others just walk in the dark
Lookin' at the world through the barrel of a gun
Hands behind their back and a parked car
America you might fair better
London your sure to be toast
You'll always get the dream that you deserve
From what you value the most

You need to fix your life up
Fix your life up
Fix it up

Go with the guitar is twelve times better than another crazy … voice
Trying to be a star
When you're just another brick in a misogynistic world, the noise (?)
When the leaders learn how to follow
And then all the people lead
Instead of everybody getting what they want
They can get what they need

You need to fix your life up
Alright
Fix your life up
Fix your life up

Don't worry about what the crowd does
Just worry about being good at what you love
Don't make this comṗlicated
You know it's true
Don't make us put somebody else in for you
