
I will walk this road, I will, I will
It's gonna be hard I know, but I will, I will
People come and they'll go, but I still, I still
Face up to the truth and just grow, I will, I will
I will fight this fight, I will, I will
I will sleep 2night, I will, I will
Ive been down before, but I still, I still
Remember what I came 4, I will, I will

I will get 2 U, I will, I will
And then I'll help U get thru, I will, I will
U've preyed on many a fool, until, until
No one cared about U, but I will, I will
