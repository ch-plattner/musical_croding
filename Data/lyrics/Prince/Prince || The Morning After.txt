
It didn't hit me til the morning after 
All eye remember was a kiss and then you were gone 
And then eye missed ur smile, the sound of ur laughter 
And now eye'm sleeping on the side you slept on 
At first eye felt the only reason you left me 
Was the proposition that eye spoke in ur ear 
Eye ain't a doctor but eye know this ain't healthy 
Instead of counting sheep, eye'm counting tears 

Eye coulda drove you home but you wouldn't let me 
Eye didn't care how far, or if it was near 
Ain't tryin 2 push you cuz eye know you just met me 
Eye'm just wishin that you were here 

Eye'm not the kinda man that's sad and lonely 
It's just that something tells me ur the one 
Even if you love somebody else it's only 
Better if eye get the chance the moment you're done 

Please don't tell me that you lost my number 
Just come back over if you don't wanna call 
Eye've got some music that will make you rhumba 
We can jam baby all nite long:
