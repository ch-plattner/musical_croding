I c a false picture of myself, another one of u
They try 2 tell us what we want, what 2 believe
Didn't that happen in the Garden
When somebody spoke to Eve?

But I'm willing 2 do The Work
Willing 2 do what I gotta do
I'm willing 2 do The Work
Tell me now- what about u?

Look around and tell me ur Sun is Risen
When ur brothers and sisters r in the Fall
What is left give when r work is done?
What do we own besides the right 2 crawl?

C we're living in a system that the devil designed
And suffering from this devil's most heinous crime
He's tried 2 keep us from the reason we were born
That is 2 b the living truth in human 4m.

But I'm willing 2 do The Work
Willing 2 do what I gotta do
I'm willing 2 do The Work
Tell me now- what about u?

This work is not an easy task
But this is the work we must do 4 Revelation2 come 2 pass
This work is the kind that turns ur back on the Ruling Class
By putting them in their place just like the past

Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work 2 do
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work 2 do

Nothing can stop us/Whatever's in r way
We got 2 go thru it 2 get 2 it
I head somebody say,

"I'm willing 2 do The Work
Do what I gotta do
I'm willing 2 do The Work
Tell me now- what about u?"

Thank u

From all over, the people came 2 do The Work. And with every phase of the
deconstruction the Everlasting Now became evermore reality. Everywhere the
people were witnessing a change, but the alchemy occurred most in the Muse.
