I'm on the set, freaks on the floor
Don't worry about my name, it's 2 long 2 remember
I could tell U now but we'd be here 'til next September
3, it be like that, see?
This ain't about the trippers trippin' like they know they be
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doing everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)

3 4, 3 4, 99
She the new hero cuz she's so divine
Unaffected by the system, she'd rather die
Than write a rap 4 some big booty heifer gettin' by
On that booty, instead of doin' duty
Aspire 2 be higher, I admire so I fire
Cuz it's flyer 2 be hungry than phat
Take it from this sista, y'all take it from that
It's flyer 2 be hungry than phat
The ride up front is better when U've been in the back
That's a fact
This ain't about this y'all, it ain't about that
This ain't about the booty movin' pumpin' the max
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doing everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

What U gonna say? (Get funky)
Now U wanna play? (Get funky)

40, 45, snake's alive
Say one thing, do another, it's time
We chill on that
Nah, I don't need a gat
I'd rather see yourself checkin' ass up 2 bat 4 another swing
Anybody can sing
There's more 2 genius than the word my sister anything I would bring
Or would U rather dine alone?
If U change your mind, U can reach me on your video phone
It's a dime, as in dollars and that's my 2 bloody cents
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doing everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

What U come 2 say? (Get funky [x2])
Come on, now how U wanna play? (Get funky [x2])
Band!
(Now)

67, 67
Freaks dance like they in heaven
DJ don't stop the music, DJ don't stop the music
Fill us with de dope track, lick us, twist us, roll us in your mouth
Light us up and take a hit, light us up and take a hit
Mmm, suck us 'til we're dry
And when we're lookin' like a roach, hit the lights
Before U say goodnight though
Let's make a toast yo
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doing everything they wanna do now!

Now! [x7]
