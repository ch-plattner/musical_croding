So what do U know, U and me
Finally face 2 face
Checking each other up and down
In all of the obvious places

So this is where U end, and U and I begin ...
(That's where U and I, U and I begin)

Baby, baby
Now your mind is open
2 poetry seldom heard
Ur heart has never been broken

Oh, I know U can feel me,know that U can dance

Not what U think, but what U believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then U know it was meant to be (meant 2 be), meant 2 be
Leave your inhibitions behind come on, come on, and see
So this is where U end (this is where U end)
And U and I begin ... (U-hu)
