
(Oh Yeah)

Yeah
Uh uh

U're gettin dirty at the club again
I'm usually round Ur waist like a chain but then,
I got that call so I jumped in my car
I love U baby,
But not like I love my guitar

Uh uh, not like I love my guitar, no

U couldn't do it all by Urself
U had 2 go and get somebody else
Ur high enough to call me
But U can't reach the bar
I love U baby
But not like I love my guitar, no
Not like I love my guitar

Oh, listen
Turn it up

Uh uh

[guitar solo]

Yeah, now dig

I tried 2 warn U that it's hard 2 B a star
Especially when Ur driving other people's car
I woulda gave U mine, girl, but U took it 2 far
I love U baby
But, just not like I love my guitar
Uh uh, not like I love my guitar

Oh

I know U love me and U wanna B friends
And if U don't at least U need 2 pretend
We're still 2gether even if we don't get that far
I love U baby
But not like I love this guitar

I love U, I love U baby
(Not like I love my guitar)

I love U baby and I wish U well (I wish U well)
I'll write a letter when I learn how 2 spell
Until that day, U can go to the... [laugh]
I love U baby.... U know the rest

Aah aah aah
