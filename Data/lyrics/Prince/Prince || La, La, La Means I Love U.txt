It's true
And U know what? I seen all those other guys 2
Baby, frankly, I don't give a damn
Many guys have come 2 U
With a line that wasn't true
And U'd pass 'em by (Pass them by)
Though U're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't U let me try? (Let me try)

Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song 2 sing
All I know is...

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U, oh baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
U are the one 4 me
Let me hold U in my arms
Gonna fill U with my charms
I'm sure that U will see (U will see)

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I wanna explain them 2 U
Baby, can U listen 2 me?

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U, oh baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U, yeah

So there, the book is open
What U wanna do?
Can U do-o-o me, baby, like I wanna do U?
Come here, let me hold U in my arms
Let me fill U with my charms

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them 2 U
Yes, 2 U!

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U) [repeat in BG]
(La, la, la, la, la (means) I love U) I love U, I really, really love U
Ooh listen 2 me, baby
Ooh, I love U, I love ya, love ya
Ooh, take my hand, girl
U gotta understand
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your man

U know where 2 find me when U make up that mind

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love U, yeah
