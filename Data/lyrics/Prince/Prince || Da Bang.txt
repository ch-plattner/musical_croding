What U do 2 me
If U waste my time
Then it's meant 2 be
I called your number (Yes I did)
Like U told me 2

Like a puppet on a string
I'm go'n dance and I'm go'n sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang!

Don't wanna lie
I just wanna do it
But some other guy (Baby)
Has beat me 2 it
If U're in love (Well)
We're 2 of a kind (Yes we are)
What good is your body, baby
Without your mind (Not much)

Like a puppet on a string
I'm go'n dance and I'm go'n sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang!

Hit me, niggas!

So here's the story
I'm here 4 U
Without the boring
Without the cool
When U try 2 fake it (Baby)
And U wanna get through (U know what I'm talkin' about)

Like a puppet on a string
I'm go'n dance and I'm go'n sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang!

Bang, bang, bang!
Yeah! Ooh!
