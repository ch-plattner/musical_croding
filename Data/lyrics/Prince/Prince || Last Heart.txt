How many times have U called my number
Wishing I was someone else?
How many times did my heart tumble
Feeling sorry 4 myself?
How many times have I kissed U
And smelled another man's perfume?
How many lonely nights I missed U
Wishing 4 ya body in my lonely room? (lonely room)

Baby, if U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break

How many times can U hurt me (hurt me)
Before your conscience makes U stop? (stop, stop, oh)
U made it all, why now desert me?
Baby, U know U can never cop (never cop), never cop
A body that'll do U like I do
U got 2 get your thing 2gether sister
I'm tired of being your fool

If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
Baby, I've taken all I can take
Baby, my heart wasn't made 2 break

Baby, don't U break my heart
No, no, don't do it!

If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
Darlin', I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break

(When U fix your mouth 2 tell that lie)
When U fix your mouth 2 tell a brand new lie
(Never before told, by and by)
Never ignore the truth, by and by
(False words should never be spoken)
False words should never be, never be spoken
(My heart should never be broken)
And baby, my heart should never be, never be broken

If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
