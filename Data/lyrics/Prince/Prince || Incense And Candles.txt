
Baby ooh (yes)
Let's go

Eye've been waiting 4 U baby all night long
(eye've been waiting 4 U baby all night long)
So eye could get somebody 2 play this song
(c'mon)
The jam that's got a beat like it's making love
(the jam that's got a beat like it's making love)
Cuz Ur the only one eye've been thinking of
(oh yea) whoaa

Come in2 my room of incense and candles
Eye've got something that U won't know how 2 handle
U can tell me na-uh but U know how this man do
Eye'ma want it all night long
C'mon c'mon
Eye'ma want it all night long

Eye'm glad we're compatible, mature, and grown
(mature and grown)
'Cause this is nothing something U can do alone
There's a dance floor but we can use a table (yes we can)
Eye've got 2 have a partner that's willing and able
(willing and able)

Come in2 my room of incense and candles
Eye've got something that U won't know how 2 handle
U can tell me na-uh but U know how this man do
Eye'ma want it all night long

Once U try 2 seduce me it grows and grows
Ur mind will never deny what Ur body knows
Eye know U want 2 take off all your clothes
But please don't do it

Eye got a cool idea my darling, let's go outside
Eye wanna smother U with something shiny as the rims upon my ride
Eye want 2 look 4 the milky way and uhh when eye find it
Eye'm gonna make U scream my name as if it was divine (Prince)
But we both know that we gotta praise the one who made ya
Give props 2 Ur mama 4 the healthy food she must have gave ya
4 the meek at heart these words they might sound like a sinner
But the truth is that U're sitting on every one of Ur dinners
But that's fine, 'Cause eye'm blind
About blind as a cat in the dark
It might come at 2 in the morning after roaming in the park
Hard 2 understand always changing plans
Harder than hell 2 handle
One scent alone make it worth Ur while the price of Prince's candle

All night
Circles of flowers or pyramids of sand
Violet colored diamonds
U got 2 understand

Incense and candles
Wherever U can
U got 2 make this woman
Lust 4 this man

Come in2 my room of incense and candles
Eye've got something that U won't know how 2 handle
U can tell me na-uh but U know how this man do
Eye'ma want it all night long
[Repeat 4x]
