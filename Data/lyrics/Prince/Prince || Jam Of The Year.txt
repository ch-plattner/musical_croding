This is the joint I've been layin' 4 all night
This is the one that really gets me gone
The DJ's on point, I'm sayin' he's alright

When the groove rubberbaby's hot

Ooh, everybody's here
This is the jam of the year
Ooh, everybody's here

Gimme a drummer and a funky bass line

And if I hit U once, I got 2 hit U some more
