(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), kick it, baby, joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

Before I melt the wax 2 quizzical
Let me just say that U are physically
The most toned one I've ever seen
U're making me proud 2 be a human be-i-ng (Uh huh!)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint 2 joint

(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), kick it, baby, joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

So first I need a picture of your mother
2 verify the fact that there's not another
One in the universe so supreme
Damn, U got the rock 2 give a brotha cream (Cream)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint 2 joint

(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (safe), joint 2 joint
(Sex, sex, sex me) - If U wanna we can kick it, baby, joint 2 joint
(Sex me) - Oh yeah, I got some hot sauce, joint 2 joint (Ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Said kick it baby, joint 2 joint (Right on, ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Yeah (safe)

Come upstairs 2 my room

Joint 2 joint (I never sucked...) [x2]

I never sucked sour splints from a chew stick
Don't lick bics cuz fire sticks 2 flame (flame)
Get wicks 2 catch brothers who choose 2 let burns remain
Now I see all Dicks, Toms and Harrys are not the same
Some dipped in my lower lip, sipped a supple poison (poison [x3])

Joint 2 joint (I never sucked...) [x4]

(Come with me, 4 those who wanna change)
(But nothing comes 4 free)

Joint 2 joint, nothing comes 4 free
If U show your love, U can get with me
U can get with me, U can get with me
Joint 2 joint

Up the stairs 2 my lovely room
Stroke your face and U're under soon
Sittin' in the corner in your underwear
Lettin' me caress your nappy hair

Joint 2 joint, nothing comes 4 free
If U show your love, U can get with me
And if U light my candle, we can share the stone
Flames of desire, sweet gypsy moans
Sweet gypsy moans
Joint 2 joint [x3]

Joint 2 joint, nothing comes 4 free

Oh great, now U think U're my soulmate
U don't even know what kind of cereal I like
Wrong! Cap'n Crunch with soy milk
Cuz cows are 4 calves
U'd probably take me 4 half
U don't love me, U're a faker
U just want me 4 my acres

(Na na, na na na na)
Joint 2 joint [x3]

Joint 2 joint, nothing comes 4 free (Sex me)
If U show your love, U can get with me [repeat in a loop]
(Na na, na na na na) (Nothing comes 4 free)
If we're ever naked in the same machine
Baby, we can kick it joint 2 joint

Where 2?
I..I don't know
An..anywhere, just drive

It's me
I'm just drivin'
Listen, I need 2 get with U
No, I mean 4, I mean 4 good
I'm serious this time
Nah, that's all over now, U know it
I front sometimes, but U know, this is as quiet as it's kept...
Listen, I just gotta get outta here, that's all
Let me call U back, alright?
Yeah, yeah, later
