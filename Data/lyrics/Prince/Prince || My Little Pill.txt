What's a single woman with no real man 2 do?
Tryin' 2 raise your kid when he couldn't give a damn about U
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
Everytime I pop my little pill

A pixie does my laundry and the universe my will
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
Everytime I pop my little pill
