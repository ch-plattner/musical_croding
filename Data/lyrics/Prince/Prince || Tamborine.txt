Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
Close my eyes what's it like,
What's it like inside your tamborine?

Oh my God, there I go
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
All alone by myself
Me and I play my tamborine

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine

I don't care 4 1 night stands
With trolley cars
That juggle 17
I just want 2 settle down and
Play around
My baby's tamborine

Tamborine what are U
Why are U the star of
All my dreams
(Star of all my dreams, are U a good tamborine)
Are U good, are U bad
Are U just unnecessary means

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Trolley cars

Long days, lonely nights
2 bad we're not allowed 2 scream (yeah, yeah, too bad)
Guess that I'll stay at home
All alone and play my tamborine (aww)

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
The tamborine
