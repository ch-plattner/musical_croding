
I see U picked me out from the crowd 
Could it be the way I play guitar? 
Master of the soft, not 2 loud 
One day, maybe I will be a star 
I see U picked me out like U want something 
But shame on U, baby, can't U see this ring? 

[CHORUS:]
What do U want me 2 do, girl? 
What do U want me 2 do, babe? 
What do U want me 2 do, girl? 
What do U want me 2 do, babe? 

I got a woman, U got a man 
So we got 2 do what's right 
I said U'd get beheaded in other lands 
If I were in your arms 2night 
Quit tryin' 2 get me under that icy plunder 
Boy, oh boy, what a scare, ooh 

[CHORUS]

U picked me out of the crowd 
And ooh, just so bold and so proud 
And dressed like U want everybody 2 just say, "Wow! 
Didn't her mama teach her better?" 
Ow, dressed like that, somebody gon' get her 

I see U picked me from the crowd 
Could it be the way I play guitar? 
Master of the soft, not 2 loud 
I don't ever really wanna be where U are, where U are, no 

What do U want me 2 do, girl? 
Tell me, what do U want me 2 do, babe? 
What do U want me 2 do, girl? 
Tell me, tell me, what do U want me 2 do, babe? 
I ain't tryin' 2 do that 
What do U want me 2 do, girl?
