Till the rain is over and gone
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
Lead line (Face the music)

If the air is a little thick in this room 2nite
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight

Talkin' so fast that even they
Talkin' so fast that even they
Don't know what they mean

Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that U everytime
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?

Thank God this ain't Monopoly
U'd make us all go back 2 start

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race

Check it

Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted 2 her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is

Before her momma or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that 1 race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)

If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear, tell me now how now would we know

And then the band say

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race
(Face the music)

D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this BS propagandi
Keepin U from me and me from U as we grow
I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
Why those before us hated each other

I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope 4 a kid

And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try 2 be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea

Race
(Face Face Face Face Face)
Face the music (Face the music)
Face the music

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

Get it?
Race
Got it

Race
Face the music
Race Race
(Face Face Face the music)
Race Race
(Face Face Face the music)
Race Race
Race Race
(Face-F-Face the music)

Race
