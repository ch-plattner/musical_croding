She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance? 
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance 

She was older but rich beyond compare 
She'd drop a thousand dollars at the saloon just 2 get her hair did 
He was good at compliments, better in the bunk 
She laced him with a crib in Paris, he hipped her 2 the funk 

Way 2 fine he was 4 her 
A dirty dog in expensive fur 
As long as she's providing chips and whips 
We can do this funky thang 
As long as she was playing the host 
He figured he would make the most of them hips and lips 
He hooked her up, rocked her coast 2 coast 

Ugly... 
So ugly, rich beyond compare 
She's dropped a couple hundred thousand dollars on a silver whip 
Just 2 match the color of her hair 
She said "Eye got plenty of what U need. 
Put the spoon down honey, c'mon, let mama feed U" 

She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance? 
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance 

Where was Eye? Oh yeah... 
A gentleman he was 
He never spoke about her nose 
So prominent because in the dark it'd glow 
If she was only tan instead of so lily white 
Her name was Doris but he called her "Fluo" 
As in "-Rescent" - That ain't right 
Fluorescent every night 
A situation bound 2 fail 
As sure a Doris' skin was pale 

Money might talk, but what does it say? 
U better get busy if U wanna get paid 
"Boy, Eye was fine back in the day" 

She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance? 
That's the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance 
Now, dance 

Dance 

He spent her money oh so well 
Take a bath in cold Kristal 
He took a trip 2 burn an old flame in 'Frisco, like wow 
But Doris caught him in her arms 
She shrugged her shoulders and said "No harm" 
Just put Ur name on this pre-nup and we can all hit the disco 

She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance? 
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance

So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?

Now, dance 

Dance
