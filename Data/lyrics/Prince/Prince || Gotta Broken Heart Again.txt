
I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz we're only supposed to be friends
You see he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz I ain't got no money to spend
You see I spend it all on long distance phone calls
Beggin her to please come home, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinking about uou
The little things you said
The things you do to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you outta my head
Oh, oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious
It feels just like the end
Cuz once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say
