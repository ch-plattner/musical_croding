Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up until the other day
There remained an empty space within my bed
Then I took one look at you
And naughty things that we could do

I took one look at you
And all the things that we could do
Dance within my head

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea, I'm yours

I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything you want
You're the teacher, show me how

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea
I'm yours
