We came to shut this down

Everybody knows
This is how it goes
Ain't no playing around
Just keep your eyes on me
If you wanna get pleased
I'm bout to shut this down

My hand is money
My ice is cold
Whatever you holdin'
You better fold
Cuz when we drop this
It's gonna make a sound
All around the world
When we come to town
We come to shut this down

You looking at me
But you never see
How i got so funky
It's a mystery
Must be genetics
My DNA
Electromagnaticsim
You can't get away

I get you baby
All sweaty and hot
I'm gonna get you where you never get got
Baby

We come to shut this down
If you got the jelly
I got your jam
I don't think you understand, we gonna do
This man
Gonna shut this down
We ain't playin around
U gotta that crew
Come on pretty
We gotta do the do
Let me do what we do

We come to shut this down
My hand is money
My ice is cold
Whatever you holdin'
You better fold
Cuz when we drop this
It's gonna make a sound
All around the world
When we come to town
We come to shut this down

Whatchu waiting for
Get out on the floor
Move your body round
Y'all know how we do
This the old school
Straight purple mack baby
We come to shut this down
