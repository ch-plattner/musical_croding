
Mister, mister,
Love U mister

Come on

[Chorus:]
Call Mr Goodnight
He'll make U feel alright
Make U throw Ur head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell Ur girlfriend
U can try with all Ur might
Just can't keep a secret
'Bout goodnight, goodnight

Hey, baby, hey baby, hey, baby, sitting all alone in my courtyard
Lookin' as if U have every right
All over the world they call me Prince
But U can call me Mr Goodnight

Surely the dandies that escort U places
Imparted a rumour or 2
About the parade of lovely faces
That follow me ... surely they do?

What say U 2 that, lips so inviting
It's all I can do not 2 stare
What say U 2 them, past, present and future
That U don't care (I don't care)

If so, U'll be the first, and I'll give u the keys
2 the whip of Ur dreams, alright?
All over the world they call me Prince (yeah)
But U can call me Mr Goodnight

[Chorus]

Now I don't wanna put to U 2 sleep with a bunch of chatter
And a rap that really don't matter
But now that U know who I am U need 2 make plans
And all Ur other pennies should scatter (scatter)

A limousine about 2 pick U up
And then took U 2 a private jet (2 fine) (yeah)
And then U gonna meet a little Spanish man
Who will offer U wine and Moet

In an hour or 2, U'll be taken to a suite
That will rock all Ur wildest dreams
And on the bed 3 dresses 2 choose 1, pick 1
Then U get a call from me (ring)

Tell me which dress U chose
So I can put on, put on my matching suit
All the real guys hold Ur hands up
U know how Mr Goodnight do it

[Chorus]

I love U baby
I don't want nobody else

Call Mr Goodnight (U can call him) (any time at all)
Call Mr Goodnight (yeah, yeah, yeah) (I love U mister)

MP3: Mike Philly in the band like jams at midnight
Before the main attraction U'll see
Slow it down somewhere here on Earth
Just 2 check how ur reaction be

And if ur heartbeat goes up a notch or 2
There ain't no telling what I might do
I got a mind full of good intentions
And a mouth full of raisenets (better not tell U)

We can watch 'Chocolat' on the big screen
Before we convene in the pool (yeah)
The waterfall'll wash Ur cares away
Already I love U, I do

[Chorus]

The energy in this field's been known to flicker lights, aye
A slip O' me with no rest, acapella moans and a break of sighs (goodnight) (call, call)
Undeterred nevertheless a masterpiece on butterscotch thighs (call, call)
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
It's time for Mr Goodnight
