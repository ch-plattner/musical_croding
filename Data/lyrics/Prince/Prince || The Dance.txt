
Eye don't wanna give U my love
'Cause Eye don't wanna lose my mind
Ohh

Eye don't wanna give U my love
'Cause if Eye do it's gonna b the last time

Eye never want to feel this way again
If Eye can't b a lover
Eye don't wanna b Ur friend, no
Eye don't wanna b friends, no

Eye don't wanna hold Ur hand
'Cause Eye just wanna follow U everywhere

Eye don't wanna c U dance
Eye don't even really want 2 take the chance
Of fallin' in love with U baby

'Cause if U ever said beautiful words 2 me
If Eye wanna b Ur fantasy, yes
Eye wanna dance
Yes

Oooooh, baby

Eye don't wanna give U my love

Eye don't wanna go 2 fast
'Cause if Eye do U just might stay
U just might stay
Eye guess Eye have a lonely dance
The longer that Eye feel this way

Eye never want to feel this way again
If Eye can't b a lover
Eye don't wanna b Ur friend

Eye don't wanna b friends, no

Eye just want this 2 end

Eye don't wanna give U my love
'Cause Eye don't wanna lose my mind

Go home, baby
U know U can't handle this
