How did I ever come this far without U, baby?
What was I thinkin', what was I tryin' 2 be?
Never did U ever give me reason 2 doubt U, baby
U are my destiny and this I truly see

I can see we're like 2 petals from the same flower, baby
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
U're my saviour, U're all I ever need (Saviour)

I used 2 say, no one lover could have me, no one lover
That was before my eyes had seen the light
2 make love with another, uh uh, I couldn't do it, no way (Couldn't do it)
U're my saviour (saviour), U're the only one that does it right

Can't U see we're like 2 petals from the same flower, baby?
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
U're my saviour, U're all I ever need

What would I be without your love around me?
(Oh, what would I be, oh, without your love?)
What would I see, U constantly astound me
(Oh baby, U know U constantly astound me)
Saviour [repeated]

Yeah!
Well, oh!
(Saviour)

Oh, how did I (how did I) come this far
Without U, baby? (without U, baby) I don't know
What was I thinkin' (what was I thinkin')
What was I tryin' 2 be? (I don't know)
But what I do know is that...

(Can't U see we're like) We're like 2 petals from the same flower, baby
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
(2 drops of water from the same sea)
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
U're my saviour, U're all I...
U're my saviour, U're all I ever...
U're my saviour, U're all I ever need (Saviour)
Saviour, U're all I ever need

Saviour, U (I do)
U are my flower, baby (flower)
Ooh, every, every hour (hour)
Oh, yes U are
Won't U come and justa... (Won't U come and justa...)
Rain, I said rain!
(Won't U come and justa...)
Rain, rain, rain!
(...rain some of your sweet love down on me?)
Down on me! [x2]
Saviour! Saviour! Saviour!
Yeah! [repeated]
Down on me!
