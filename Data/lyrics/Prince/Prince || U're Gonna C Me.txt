
I know that I'm not gonna sleep 2nite
Cuz u're not by my side and that ain't right
I thought that we bought this bed 4 two,
But what good is it if I'm not with u

Gimme a page on my 2-way
I'll hit u back with no delay
When u hear all eye've got 2 say
U're gonna c me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got 2 get u all alone
And when eye do baby it's on
U're gonna c me...U're gonna c me

There's never a minute that I find
That u don't ever cross my mind
If u could just hold me tight u'd c...
There's nothing harder 4 u than me

Gimme a page on my 2-way
I'll hit u back with no delay
When u hear all eye've got 2 say
U're gonna c me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got 2 get u all alone
And when eye do baby it's on
U're gonna c me...U're gonna c me

Gimme a page on my 2-way
I'll hit u back with no delay

U're the reason I took a rope and lassoed the moon
2 prove that when it comes 2 u
There's nothing I won't do...
I'd stare in2 the sun if u would be mine
It's not so great a leap since 2 all others I am blind

I know that I'm not gon' sleep 2nite
