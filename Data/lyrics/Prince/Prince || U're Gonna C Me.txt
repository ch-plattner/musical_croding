
Eye know... I'm not gonna sleep 2nite 
Cuz u're not by my side and that ain't right 
Eye thought that we bought this bed 4 2 
What good is it if eye'm not with you 

[Chorus]
Gimme a page on my 2-way 
Eye'll hit you back with no delay 
When you hear all eye've got 2 say 
U're gonna c me 
Whether in person or the phone 
I've got 2 get you all alone 
And when eye do, baby, it's on 
U're gonna c me 
U're gonna c me 

There's never a minute that eye find 
That you don't ever cross my mind 
If you could just hold me tight u'd c 
There is nothing harder 4 you than me 

[Chorus]

U're the reason I took a rope 
& lassoed the moon 
2 prove that when it comes 2 you 
There's nothing that eye won't do 
Eye would stare in2 the sun 
If you would be mine 
It's not so great a leap 
Since 2 all others eye am blind 

Eye know eye'm not gonna sleep 2nite 
Cuz ur not by my side and that ain't right 

[Chorus]

U're gonna c me
