
How beautiful r u? there's more than 
A thousand replies 
Could it b ur lips or ur golden eyes? 
When eye think of an answer 
That's when eye get so surprised 
Another wonder of the world realized 
That's y 

Eye just don't want you here 
Eye just don't want you near me baby 

Cuz eye'm scared eye'll cry 
And live you like crazy 
Flying above all fears 
Eye haven't seen any tears, not lately 
Eye don't wanna land not even maybe 

How desperate am eye? 
Eye wonder if you r what keeps me alive 
Alone eye can't get as high 
Even tho eye've tried 

It's different when u're grown 
The wine don't taste the same 
When u're alone 
The size of the bed now seems like 
The biggest that eye've ever known 

[Chorus]

There's so much more 4 you and me 2 explore 
Ooh baby baby 
When you walk thru that door 
Eye am gonna give you what u're waiting 4 

Baby lemme break this down 

Eye am gonna say this once 
Then eye am gonna leave this town 
If you can learn 2 open ur eyes under water 
Then you and me won't drown 
Without each other 
Eue promise eye'll c you on the other side 
Just believe in me and trust this ride 
Eye am so sincere right now 
Eye just... 

Eye just want you here 
Eye just want you near me baby 
Eye'm scared eye'll cry 
And love you like crazy 
Eye'm flying above all fears 
Eye haven't seen any tears not lately, no 
Eye don't wanna land, not even maybe 
Donny hathaway's "song 4 u" ain't the same 
Without you
