Gimme that number, we can party all night long

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long
Checkin' 4 bikinis, layin' in the sand
Rub it like a genie, livin' while we can

Afternoon in the city, somewhere in July
Policemen actin'... yeah, U know, de-elevate a brotha's high
The mama's in the short dress, blowin' in the breeze
The papa's just a-prayin' 4 the gust that will bust that butt out, please, oh!

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long
Checkin' 4 bikinis, layin' in the sand
Rub it like a genie, livin' while we can

Here we go - Oh
All 7 - Hey
Baby, baby - Get naughty
Mmm, uh

Everybody's got a black book in case of emergency
In case the sun is shinin' at the beach and the honeys are out 2 play
The cool boys just a-watchin' all the pretty moves U make
Frontin' in the sun, jammin' 4 the one lover that U wanna take home

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long
Checkin' 4 bikinis, layin' in the sand
Rub it like a genie, livin' while we can

Here we go - Hey
All 7 - All night long
Baby, baby - Summertime
Uh, uh

Sex in the summer, sex in the summertime
It will be fine

Checkin' out Mahalia's greatest - "In The Upper Room"
When my boy Kirk calls singin'
"Hope we get 2gether soon (soon, soon)
We can fire up the Honda and pick up Rhonda
We can jam on a brand new tune
Improvise all through the night, it'll be just like havin'..."

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long
Checkin' 4 bikinis, layin' in the sand
Rub it like a genie, livin' while we can

Oh oh oh oh - We'll get it on
All 7 - Party, darlin'
Baby, baby - Oh oh oh oh
Uh, uh

Can't U feel the new day dawning? All believers will see
An end 2 suffering and every disease
Every waking hour will soon be spent kissin' each other
Angelic sisters and brothers
Clap your hands 4 one another, we'll be havin'...

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long
Checkin' 4 bikinis, layin' in the sand
Rub it like a genie, livin' while we can

Oh oh oh oh - Busy busy
Give it 2 me - All night long
Ooh yeah
Rub me, rub me - Livin' while we can, baby

Sex in the summer, gettin' it on
Gimme that number, we can party all night long

Sex in the summer

Sex in the summer
