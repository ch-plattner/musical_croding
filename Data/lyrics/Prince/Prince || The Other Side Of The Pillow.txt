Cool as the other side of the pillow
Smooth as another glass of wine, oh yes sir
I'm so glad U're my baby, oh yeah
I'm so glad that U're mine
Bad as Bonny when she ran with Barrow [Clyde], yeah
When U kiss me, feels like I'm committing a crime, oh yeah
U use furniture in new ways, yes you do
I can't find the adjectives enough to say
I'm so glad U're my baby...okay (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Cool as the other side of the pillow (oh baby)
So smooth there's another glass of wine (bubbly, bubbly)
I'm so glad U're mine, U're my baby (oh yes I am), oh yes I am (oh yes I am)
I'm so glad U're mine

Cool as the other side (U're my baby) of the pillow
Smooth, I wanna drink U all out
How did U learn that trick with the ... chair?
I don't care
Just as long as U do it again

Cool as the other side, cool as the other side, cool as the other..
Cool as the other, cools as the other side...
As the other side of the pillow, baby
Cool (cool),
Glas of wine
I'll get tipsy and I ... [whistling]
Cool as the other side of the pillow
Cool
