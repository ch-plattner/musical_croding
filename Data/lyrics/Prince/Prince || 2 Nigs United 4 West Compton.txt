Honey, do U know I let Robert cut my hair this morning?
(Honey, look at this one here) (I'm lookin' Joe tryin' 2 see)

Oh girl, where'd U get those shoes?

U know he had me lookin' so bad (Honey, she's so free)
I'm so tired

These are "come-and-fuck-me" pumps (Who, Robert?)

Maurice thinks: (Mm, I think that's right, honey)

Go on up 2 her, say something

Maurice, what, what can I serve U? (Umean he's male?)

Cat, what's happenin' babe? (Bitch, would U play something?)

Get outta my face! (Honey, it's not that type of party)
(Talk 2 me, talk 2 me - do U remember me?)

What cha mean? (Honey, he could teach U the answer 2 life)

Honey, U see these pumps? (Bitch!)
(Answer? Honey, U ain't gonna quit)

I wanna, I wanna: (Who U callin' bitch? Ho bitch!)
