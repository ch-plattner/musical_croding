Come now all ye strays of the world, there's a place 4 U
In Love's kingdom, boys and girls, all are welcome 2

Strays of the world, strays of the world
La la la la la

Surrender all ye sad of heart, 2day hold back no tears
The past is gone when we can start conquering our fears

Strays of the world, strays of the world
La la la la la

Strays of the world, strays of the world
All ye boys and girls, all around the world
Are welcome 2 come on in, come on in
Strays of the world, strays of the world
(Strays of the world)

Fear not all ye lonely ones, Love will find us soon
This will kiss the risin' sun and make love 2 the moon

Strays of the world (Come on, come on)
Come on, strays of the world (Come on, come on)
Come on in (Come on)
The door is open (Open up that door)
Hey yeah! (Hey yes, hey yes)
Let me hear U say "Yeah!" (Hey yes)
Let me hear U say "Yeah!" (Hey yes)

Strays of the whole world

Strays, strays, strays of the world

Come
