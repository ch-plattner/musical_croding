[Curly Fryz:]
That’s why I never let a man pick out my clothes

[Prince:]
Roll up in the town early afternoon (hey hey hey)
Looking for the pimp dress that'll make you swoon (hey hey hey)
Found a little number and a fancy brassiere (hey hey hey)
Lookin' like a mack all up in here (lookin' like a mack all up in here)

[Chorus - Prince:]
Whole block lookin' and the girls are hot
Pick one come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you want a lot of what's cookin'
She's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin' like a mack, like a mack

[Curly Fryz:]
Whatcha lookin' at me? Oh!
Step in lookin' like who? Whoa!
Drop it down then I pick it up slow
We run the town, city, states and the globe
Tryin' holla, I’m like, “What? No!”
Plus he lookin' like eww, gross!
I’m on the wave can you keep up with my flow
My music bang, you can feel it in your soul

And I rolled up in the town early afternoon
On the block lookin' hot like it's early June
At the top shinin' bright something like the moon
Can you picture with my lyrics bumpin' my cartoons
With my ace cause we're queens so we never get carded
Kill the scene then we leave call it “dearly departed”
Tryin' to dip but we can't cause we getting bombarded
You already know we coming the hardest

[Chorus - Curly Fryz:]
Cam light flashing and my click is hot
Pick one and come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what's cookin
‘Cause she’s lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', aw

[Prince:]
Look at little Willy walking down this way
Only bring a blonde on a good day
Not another autograph, cue the DJ
Everybody dance when I say
Whole block crushing and the girls are hot
Dancin' with each other cause the boys are not
Tryin' to trade numbers for the drinks they bought
But, whatcha supposed to think in a club full of thots

[Chorus - Prince:]
Pro black fashion and the girls are hot
Pick one, come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what's cookin'
Cause she's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', like a mack

[Curly Fryz:]
Here’s my crew dressed in all black like we mobbin'
Pockets got the mumps so you know we never starvin'
Noddin' and bobbin' our heads to the beat
You see how we rockin' shows, go and get up out your seats
Life is like a movie when we step upon the stage
I got fifty different styles that I got up on display
We gon' make the party jump so you know we're here to stay
Stackin' paper up while y'all on the same page, come on

[Chorus - Curly Fryz:]
Cam light flashin’ ‘and my click is hot (hey)
Pick one and come and show me what you got (come on)
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what’s cookin’
‘Cause she’s lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, aw

[Prince:]
Tryin' to trade numbers for the drinks they bought (hey hey hey)
Drinks they bought, dri-drinks they bought (hey hey hey)
Club on a, club on a, club on a
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Club on a, club on a, club on a
She's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', like a mack

Lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin'
