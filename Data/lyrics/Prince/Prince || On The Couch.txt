
Come on baby.. ooh, ooh, ooh 
Don't make me sleep on the couch 
No.. No.. No.. 
Love jones is on the TV again, baby 
Ooh, I wanna go down south - yeah 

Come on baby 
Come on baby 
Its so undignified to sleep alone 
O yes it is 
That's what all the people ain't got nobody do 
U know they do 
Talkin' (talkin') on the telephone 

Don't make me crash 
Don't U do it baby 
(Don't U do it, uh-uh) 
Don't make me sleep without ur kiss 
O darlin' without ur kiss (Don't U make me do it) 
Tossin' and a-turnin' 
Every inch of me yearnin' 
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Don't u make me
Suffer for this
I know, I know, I know, I know that 
We agreed to be married (U know I know) 
Shouldn'ta let me unzip ur dress 
Y'd U do it, baby (Y'd u do it) o yeah 
confess u tease 
unless u please me 
Don't make me sleep on the couch
