
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
The beat you're giving is the rhythm of life
Everybody get happy

If you really come to party
This is the place to be
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

Tonight the stars are out
There's music in the air
The sounds of joy and celebration
Are drowning out despair

If you're the king of hate
Or if you're the queen of misery
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

This party's sick
With all the [Incomprehensible]
Get the police quick
Don't let them shut us down

Don't do it
No
Rock it

Tonight I love everybody
That's right, everyone
I don't care what you came here for
As long as you have fun

Everybody get free
Everybody get free
Everybody love me

There ain't no shame
In having a good time
There's only us to blame
If we make it up right
Oh, I ain't lying

There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

Shake it like you don't know better
Woop de woop
Shake it like you don't know better
Woop de woop

There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Me

Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Me

Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
