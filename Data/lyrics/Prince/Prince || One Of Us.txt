If God had a name, what would it be
And would we call it 2 His face
If we were faced with Him and all His glory?
What would U ask if U had just one question?

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Tryin' 2 make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like
And would U wanna see it
If seeing meant that U would have 2 believe in things like heaven
And Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Tryin' 2 make His way home

Yeah

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob (slave) like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Tryin' 2 make His way home

Like a holy rollin' stone
Back up 2 heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept 4 the Pope maybe in Rome
But He ain't home, He aint home, He ain't home!
No, no, no, He ain't home! [x2]
Oh yeah, oh!

(What if God was one us?) [x4]
