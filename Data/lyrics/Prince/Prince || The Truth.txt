Turned out 2 be a lie...
How will U know the Truth?
If U were given all the answers
And U stopped 2 wonder why
But how will U know the Truth?

Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice U make ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no MF piece of pie

[clock ticks]

What If time's only reason?
Was to give us all somethin' 2 fear?
And if so y'all, the end of the journey's so clear

Questionaire, What did U stand 4?
Questionaire, Who did U save?
When it gets right down to-wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it U take more than U gave

Everybody got a right to love
Everybody got a right to lie
But the choice U make aint no piece of cake
It ain't no MFMF [O(+> screams the following] piece of pie [computer blips]

Mmmm oh
Gotta (Gonna?) tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth

If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts & move to back to Neptune
