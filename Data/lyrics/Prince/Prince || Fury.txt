
U must have heard it on the news this morning
Congratulations! New star is born
Sun 2 his shadow, rose 2 a thorn
There ain't no fury like a woman scorned

Y'all must have dug it, when u did your thang
It's like a song, everybody wanna sing
When the music's over, ur ears ring
With a voice that's saying, 'Queen got no King"

He got a message saying, u tried 2 reach him on the 'phone
He didn't wanna answer cuz he's so afraid
U'd probably tell him just 2 leave u alone

I bet u heard he got another band
They're makin' money, they're makin' plans
U feel left out, but u need 2 understand
Word on the street - he's still ur man

Look out, here comes ur rainy day
But u think you got a good reason 2 say
Always in ur heart, come what may,
Even though his might get broken

Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow 2 the sun, lets do the 1
Hell ain't got no fury

Will this song have a happy ending?
Will his heart need a-mending?
What's the name? Only she knows
Only the woman knows, only she knows

2 sides 2 every story
One man's gloom, another man's glory
Sun 2 his shadow, rose 2 a thorn
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
No fury like a woman scorned
