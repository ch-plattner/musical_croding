If U're 18 and over, come here
I got something 4 your mind
(Come)
U should do that baby
No more will U cry
(Come)
The spirit is calling
Here's a reason why
(Come)
If U had a chance 2 see the future would U try?
(Come)
If U will, so will I

(Come)
When I call U up, I wanna tell U what 2 wear
(Come)
Don't be surprised if I tell U 2 go bare
(Come)
Long as U wash between your soul and through your hair (I'm gonna do it)
(Come)
I'll do my duty there

(Come)
U should do that baby
No more will U cry
(Come)
The spirit's calling
Here's a reason why
If U had a chance (come) 2 see the future would U try?
(If U had a chance 2 see the future would U try?)
(Come)
If U will, so will I
(If U will, so will I)

(Come)
(When U) When I lay U down I'm gonna tell U what 2 feel
(Come)
(Don't U) Don't be surprised if I make U my daily meal
(Come)
(Lickin' U inside) Lickin' U inside, outside
(Outside) All sides (All sides), up and down (up and down)
(Come)
With my tongue in the crease, baby I go 'round
When I go down, down, down, (Come) down, down, down, da-da-down

(When I do, no more)
No more will U cry
(Come)
Spirit's calling
Here's a reason why
(Come)
If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?
(If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?)
(Come)
If U will, so will I
(If U will, so will I)
So will I

(Come)
U should do that baby
U should do that girl
(Come)
(Come)
U should do that baby
(Come)
(Come)
U should do that girl

(Come)
When I suck U there
I don't wanna hear U scream (Don't wanna hear U scream)
(Come)
Don't talk or breathe
Don't cough or sneeze
Oh, just dream, dream, dream
Baby, my tongue's gonna do things that U never seen (Seen)

(Come)
(When I) When I blow that mind baby
(Come)
I'm gonna drive U crazy
(Come)

U should do that girl (No more will U cry)
(Come)
U should do that baby (Here's a reason why)
(Come)
(If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?)
{do that girl, do that girl}
(Come)
U should do that baby (If U will, so will I)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(No more will U cry)
(Come)
(Here's a reason why)

(If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?)
(Come)
(If U will so will I)
Now break it down

(When I blow that mind baby)
(Come)
(I'm gonna drive U crazy)
(Come)

Can I suck U baby?
(Come)
Can I fuck U baby?

(Come)

Shout it (Come) ou-ou-out
(No more will U cry)
(Come)
(Here's a reason why)
(Come)
And if U had a chance 2 see the future would U try?
Oh, (Come)
If U will, (So will I) if U will, so will I (So will I)

Like a (Come) splendid, open ended
Celibate friend (No more will U cry), pretending
Not 2 know (Come) it (know it) when I blow it (blow it)
In your eyes (Here's a reason why)
Like a strawberry (Come), chocolate
Fender jazz, mashed potato, fuzztone (Come)
All over your thighs

Oh baby
That's the only (Come) Come I know
When I'm deep inside that
Yeah, that's the only (Come) time
The only time U go
"Ooh, baby U're so good"
"Ooh, baby U're so good"
Aw, shut up (Come)
This is just so U Come

Come
Come
No more will U cry

It's no wonder there's a puddle there
Holding it in 4 so long
U know U can let it go
It won't be wrong
(Come)
It's just U and me baby
Tonight and 4ever more
(Come)
U should do that baby
Fuck it
On the floor
(Come)

Or better yet, why don't U do it on the chair?
(Come)
U should get that shit started
U can change your underwear
(Come)
Yeah, U can always change your underwear
(Come)

It don't mean your rep cuz U kiss in a restaurant
(Come)
It don't mean your rep just cuz me tallywhacker suckin' is all U want
