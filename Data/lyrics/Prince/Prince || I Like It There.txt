Anyone can tell I care
Twice an hour I'm thinkin' of ya
Around your waist I wanna be there

On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

Anyone can see what's come over me
Don't u know it's 'cause of u
I'm in a daze but that's the way it's gotta be
Let me count the ways I'm diggin' u
Diggin' u, baby
I'm diggin' u, baby
I hope u're diggin' me too

Baby,
I like it there
I like it there
I like it there
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

Can I count the ways that I'm diggin' u
I hope u're diggin' me too

Yeah,
I like it
I like it
I like it
That's right
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

Every damn day I please u
What can I say Shakespeare hasn't said before?
Like an embryo baby
Don't abort this dire need 4 u
All my emotional ejaculate on the floor (on the floor)
And what's more, what's more
Your heavenly body, baby
I swear (I swear), I swear
I like it there
yeah

(I like it there) Don't think I don't when I do, girl
(I like it there) U know how much I love ya
(I like it there) More than I love my hair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I like it there
I like it there (I like it there)
I like it there

On your heavenly body I swear (baby, baby, I swear)
I like it there
