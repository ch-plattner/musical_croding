Is it me or did the room just get darker?
Is it me or did I just lay down and die?
Is this a dream or did the world just crumble at my very feet?
How in heaven will I ever be alright?

There is lonely and there is lonely
And then there is how I feel right now
Perhaps only Cain when he'd slain his brother
Could ever come close 2 knowing how ... yeah

There is lonely and there is lonely
And then there is how I feel right now
Perhaps only Cain when he'd slain his brother
Could ever come close 2 knowing how

There is lonely and there is lonely
And then there is how I feel right now
