
Pardon me, I wanna talk to you
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you
What I'm going to do
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you
I don't care cuz
I really wanna hold you
And I'm so scared
[Girl], he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I wanna do
Oh, I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it
Do it to you right
Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, c'mon baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I wanna mention

I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right
Do it all night
I,I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right

I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right

gotta do it, do it
Do it all night
Do it to you right

Do it all night
Do it to you right
