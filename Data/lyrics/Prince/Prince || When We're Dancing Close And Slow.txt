
When we're dancing close and slow
I never want to let you go, no, no
I feel your warm embrace
The softness of your face
Tell me, baby, are we here alone?
When we're kissing long and hard
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel

When we're dancing close and slow
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I want to come inside of you
I want to hold you when we're through
Can't you feel my love touching you?
