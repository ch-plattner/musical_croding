
How can I stand 2 stay where I am?
Poor butterfly who don't understand
Why can't I fly away in a special sky?
If I don't find my destiny soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

I want to live life to the ultimate high
Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Maybe I'll kiss u some wild special way
If nobody kills me or thrills me soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

If that's alright

Lovers like us dear are born 2 die
If they don't find us what will we do?
I guess we'll make love under the cherry moon
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon
