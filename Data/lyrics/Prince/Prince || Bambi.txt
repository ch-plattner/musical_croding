I knew from the start
That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue.
You had another lover and she looked just like you
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

It's so hard to believe
Maybe it's because you're so young
Or maybe I'm just too naive
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun

Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

All your lovers - they look just like you
But they can only do the things that you do
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man

Bambi, I know what you need
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed

Yeah!
