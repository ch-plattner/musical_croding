Ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-oh-ooh [2x]

It's late and I'm running out of clever things 2 say
The kind that will bring a girl like U 2 tears
There's only one more glass of this rose
Let's throw it on the fire with our past
And dance the night away until...

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we R - 4ever, always

It's late and I think it's about time 4 U and me 2 get closer...
2 get closer than we ever did before (ooh)
Whenever there's a tide U can let it ride inside your interior
Lay back, relax upon my shore (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh baby, I wanna make love 2 U right here
One inside the other one - no fear, we're here until...

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we R - 4ever, always

Blow out this candle sunlight
And come lay down next 2 me
And paint another rainbow - ooh-wee (ooh-wee)
Eclipse this light with extasy

[...]
Come on, come on
Let's lay down
I'm walking out of what to say
That kind of lucky rhyme
Make a chippy wanna say:
"Whisper in the belly
2 me rocking rose"
Do U like I do
Come on and dance the night away
Let's lay before they get to close the door
U and me, we got 2 get down on the floor
Come on, let the tide ride in and off the shore
I wanna love U once again - and then some more
Lay your head back I got my hand behind your head
Like U do the limbo supple on the bouncy bed
Let's bouncing on the summer spring
And when U start 2 fall
U come like a cold winter due in Montreal

(Come on baby)
(The sun, the moon and stars) - hey-hey, hey-hey
(The tide ride) - hey-hey, hoo-hoo
(The tide ride - hou)

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we R - 4ever, always

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we R - 4ever, always
