That eye just can't explain?
What r these new inspirations
That eye can't get out my brain?
How am eye gonna sleep with this feeling
Rushing all through my veins?
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't u wanna go get saved?

The night is calling u 2 act
Act upon every urge
U can't get no satisfaction
If u ain't got the courage
Eye don't know what u're afraid of
Eye don't know what u've heard
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't u wanna know the word?

Who's gonna save us when them spiders get next 2 u?
Spinning their sticky webs around what u do
We gotta safeguard against 4ked tongue and the treachery of the wicked 1
Get up, come on let's do something

Don't matter how far u have 2
The truth has got to be told
Don't matter how shiny ur lips
They'll never b streets of gold
They might try 2 get us crazy
Cuz they don't know what eye've heard
We got this new xhaltation
Eye'm talking about the word

Who's gonna save us when them spiders get next to u
Spinning their sticky webs around what u do
We gotta safeguard against 4ked tongue and the treachery of the wicked 1
Get up, come on let's do something

Get up, come on let's do something
No reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on let's do something
Come on, go, let's get saved
Get up, come on let's do something
No reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on let's do something
Come on, go, let's get saved

Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't u wanna hear the word?
