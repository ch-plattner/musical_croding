
I just can't get to sleep
Feels like a couple of weeks I been tryin'
The sound of this train is key
Keeping everybody from hearin' me cryin'
'Cause every other beat of my heart
I know that we should never be apart
And if it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train and never get back on
And never get back on

Sleepin' with your face on my phone
A face that I never should've left alone
Pillowcase full of your cologne
Yes I got a crush and it'll never be outgrown
Every other beat of my heart
I know that we should never be apart
if it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train and never get back on
never get back

Stop this train, Stop this train

Nothin' makes sense to me nobody's got a clue
'Cause nothin' and nobody makes me feel like you do
Thought I'd be high as the sky
Rock 'n' roll forever and never die
Used to never need a reason to fly
Now I see that you're the only reason to try
Doesn't matter who's right or wrong
I never wanna be the one singin' this song
If it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train and never get back on
