Come on!
Yeah!
C-c-c-c-c-come on!
Would U please look at this mother next 2 me
Frontin' more booty than Peru got keys
Damn, if I don't get that
Wait right there and I'll be right back
Got a new trick in the back of my car
It's kinda like a movie but U're the star
Lights, camera, make a scene
The Endorphinmachine

Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Step right up and I'll strap U in
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
Unless of course U don't believe in it
As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
U'll believe in somethin' before this night is through
Press one 4 the money, press 2 4 the dream
And get ready 4 somethin' that U've never seen
The Endorphinmachine

Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby (Go baby)

Tommy Barbarella, turn it on

Uh huh, uh huh
Hold up, wait a minute
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
U there with the cynical disposition
Perhaps U'd like 2 join us in a mission
Of fishin' 4 logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, U're feelin' like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time U must defend
Your right 2 die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't gonna hurt U
Go baby

Come on, come on (Endorphinmachine)
Well, I told ya (Go baby)
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby, go baby, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Don't make me!

Prince esta muerto (Prince is dead)
Prince esta muerto (Prince is dead)
Que viva para siempre el Poder de la Nueva Generacion
(Long live the New Power Generation)
