If eye never get 2 hold ur hand 
If eye never get 2 b ur man 

That's ok cuz eye've got other plans 
Right now, right now 
If eye never get 2 kiss ur lips 
If eye never get 2 feel ur hips 
Close 2 me 

That's ok eye ain't gonna trip 

Not now no how 

Cuz eye'vv for 
4ever 
Eternity is just one kiss away 

So they say 

The opera, jill scott or the fair 
Cyprus, if eye never get 2 take you swimming there 
If you never know how much eye care 
Eye swear 

It's not fair 

If eye never get 2 make you laugh 
If we never get 2 take a bubble bath 

Eye don't wanna part with you 
Not 2night 
If you gonna b a part of my past 

Eye just want 4ever 

Eternity is just one kiss away 

So many things 
We can do in the new world 

Eye can b ur future lover 
U can b my future girl 
If eye never get 2 c ur smile 

Underneath the white veil 
Walkin' up the aisle 

Eye just might go crazy 

Eye might go wild 

So stop lookin at me like that 
Unless you want me 2 bite that 
4ever 

Eternity is just one kiss away 

A million 2morrows 
Is better than one day 
4ever
