
Hey baby what's ur name? 
Do you wanna play a game? 
Play it like we don't know when 
We'll ever get 2 play again 
Xperimental and so brand new 
The things eye wanna do with you 
Like a physical kind of blue 
Come on baby let's get 2 it 

Eye want a lover that can improvise 
Eye want a lover that can make me cry 

Baby eye don't care what you learned in lovemaking school 
U and me we 'bout 2 jam 
Make love like the first woman and man 
Eye don't wanna know ahead of time 
The notes you play should b a 
Reaction 2 mine 
Nothing planned or contrived 
Then both of us will arrive 
At r destination 

Eye wanna feel like eye've been hypnotized 
If you think you can then let's go 4 a ride 

Love like jazz... love like jazz... love like jazz
