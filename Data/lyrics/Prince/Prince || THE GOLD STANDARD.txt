Everybody get ready 2 move (Go, go, go, go...)
Oh yeah
Everybody, everybody

Listen

We know what y'all be thinkin', nude is the brand new yawn
Everybody's just drinkin', inhibitions just gone
U don't need 2 be rude, U don't need 2 be wild
Whatever U do, don't compromise and done with style

The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up, let Ur body move
U
I'm talkin', talkin' 2 U
Got 2, got 2 let Ur body move

We know what y'all be feelin', there use 2 be a time
Music was like a spiritual healing, the body, the soul and mind (Some medicine)
U don't need 2 be rude, U don't need 2 be wild
If what U play take Ur troubles away and make somebody smile

The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up, let Ur body move
U
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' 2 U
Oh yeah

Shut Ur body down, make U walk around, let me feel all U bobbin' and Ur troubles gets old
24 carrot hashtag, put Ur phone in Ur bag, ain't nobody got 2 tell U put Ur hands in the air, say "Ow!"
When the beat's 2 much, U need 2 drop that cup, one left and right, hands up, everybody just...
Everybody just...
Swing Ur hip 2 the left and right, if U know about the "Bus Stop," there's a tight hook
Now everybody just shake
Shake
New power slide
New power slide
Ha, ha, ha
Here come the chorus y'all

The gold standard, crazy amazing, upper echelon groove
The gold standard, crazy amazing, turn it up, let Ur body move

Turn it up, let me see that body move
Let me see Ur body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Let me see Ur body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
Body, body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move

Turn it up, let me see that body move
Turn it up, let me see that body move
