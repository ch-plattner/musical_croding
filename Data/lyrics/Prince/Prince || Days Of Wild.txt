(Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!)

Break down! Huh, this is a bust (Hold onto your wigs!)
All U sorry motherfuckers up against the wall
If U don't play, bite the dust
Cuz in a couple of simple fuckin' phrases
I'm gonna hip U 2 the fuckin' plays of
The brand new mad style - y'all say!
(These are the days of wild)
Hell yeah!

(Hold onto your wigs!) [x2]

Pop guns and weed? Brother please!
We're 2 wise 4 nonsense
The other 90's was better suited 4 that biz
Back when Dick was fuckin' Liz
Before soda pop had fizz
Don't blame it on your jockstrap full of jizz
Mentality so insane
I got a Tech-9 2 and it's called my brain
Shoot another brother? Not 2day
Death from envy is the only way
I can tear shit up y'all, that's my style
These are the days of wild - put'em up!

(Hold onto your wigs!)
These are the days of wild

Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so
I only knew one and never told her though
I thought about it many times (Diss me?)
That's the kind of shit 2 make U check your mind
Is your blood type the type that flows?
Is your blood type the type just stereo?
A woman every day should be thanked
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked
And if a woman ever said I did
She's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid
I'ma tear shit up y'all, that's my style
These are the days of wild!

Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat
Up until the day another wanna laugh behind your back
Sayin' we all look the same
God bless America, home of the brave
I'd rather dress 2 make a woman stare
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare
It's a freezer burn compared 2 cool
If U still got loot, then who's the fool?
Everybody wanna take the stand
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man
I'ma tear shit up y'all, that's my style
These are the days of wild - put'em up!

Stop the cameras, turn the lights off
