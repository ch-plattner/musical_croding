
It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
It took 5 months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took 5 minutes when I saw your face again
2 fall in love all over, I guess with U I'll never win

March was a cold one in more ways than one
Went down 2 the nightclub lookin' 4 the sun
Lookin' 4 a light that could brighten up a day
That's been darker than a hole since U went away

April usually brings showers
This time it was a hurtin' kind
This woman said she wanted my baby
I told her I'd have 2 be deaf, dumb, and blind
2 fall in love with someone that I barely knew
The baby would never really have a father
Cuz I still, cuz I still, cuz I still, still, still, huh
Be stuck on U

It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
Get off my mind, baby
Fallin' in love all over... U I'll never win

May was her name, she was jumpin'
Jumpin' from plane 2 plane
Actress or model or somethin'
Can't even remember her first name

June brought an Easter bunny
Needless 2 say, hmph, that girl was late
Told a made-up story 2 a busy-body of our only date
What a sketch!

July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
But it only made me, made me want U more
She's gone, she's gone but U're still here
I want U very..., huh, it's U I fear

But it took 5 women 2 get U off my mind
It took 5 months, 5 months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took 5 minutes and I saw your face again
I fell in love all over with U, I guess I'll never win
(I'll never win)
