Inside lookin' out my window
I don't see nothin' but rain
Sun up in the sky just-a-shinin' (Just-a-shinin')
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain (Mm-hmm)

Like an innocent man that's on death row
I don't understand what made U go
And wanna leave me, baby
Leave me in the dark
Can U tell me, tell me?

U took my sex and my money (Money)
Took all my self-esteem, yes U did
U had the nerve 2 think it was funny (Funny)
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir

U absolutely drove a man 2 tears
All I really know is that U sincerely
Wanna hurt me, baby
Oh, yes U do
U wanna hurt me in the dark

Sunshine - Somebody make the sun shine
Dark cloud - Somebody take this dark cloud away

Just as sure as Noah built the ark (That's how sure)
That's how sure I am U broke my heart

How could U, baby, leave me in the dark?
Baby, it's so dark
So dark, so dark (Dark)

Feel like the sun ain't never gonna shine
U left me in the dark
So dark, so dark (Dark)
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had 2 part
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window, it's so dark
So dark, so dark (Dark)

Sometimes I want 2 curse the ground U walk on
Even when I know that everything U feel, I feel it 2

I wanna curse U, baby
Ooh, U left me in the dark
And now I want 2 curse U, baby (I wanna curse U, baby)
4 leavin' me alone, alone, alone (U left me in the dark)
Oh, yes U did
And now all I wanna say is
In the dark
Ow! U left me [x2]

It's like being on death row (In the dark)
I don't understand why U had 2 go
I don't understand why U (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why U (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why U hurt me, hurt me, hurt me, hurt me here!
Just leave me (In the dark)
(In the dark)

So dark, so dark (Dark) (In the dark)
So dark, so dark (Dark)
(In the dark)
