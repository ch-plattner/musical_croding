I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I used 2 be frightened by the devil
And drawn 2 those who weren't afraid
Remember when u told me
That love was touching souls?
Well, surely u touched mine
Part of u pours out of me from time 2 time in these lines
U're in my blood like holy wine...u're so bitter and so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
And still b on my feet...still be on my feet
