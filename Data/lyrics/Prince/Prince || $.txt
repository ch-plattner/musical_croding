
Here she come, the most popular girl 
In the whole wide world 2day 
U don't know if she would but what's good if she'd some & look ur 
Way 
U're standing over there tryin' 2 b gangsta coppin' ur favorite lean 
U give her the head nod 
O my god you're the craziest thing 
She's ever seen but ur 

Dancing 
And she's loving you all night long 
In ur little world she's ur best girl 
It's all money 
Ain't nothing wrong 
Ur dancing and she's loving you all night long 

Funky dolla bill it's real you'all 
Easy come, easy gone 

Where you go everybody wanna know 
So they can put it in a magazine 
Next 2 the ad 4 the latest fad 
In black hair care - vaseline 
With this car these rims this grill you'll b 
The illest on the scene 
Whatever whatever all you need is ur music 
And you'll b a party machine and you'll b 

[Chorus]

How many times you look 4 happy 
And you never c the rich folx there? 
But if the dj really dropped a needle all the tru players just don't 
Care 
When all the news just gimme the blues and make you wanna pop a pill 
What difference does it make who gots the most bank, it's just ink and 
Chlorophyll 

[Chorus]

Pawns aside who's the king the 2 and 4 
Wit hot sauce from the bay 2 baltimore 
Take ur woman 4 she hit the front door 
And whoop ur whole crew cuz they fat and slow 

Dancing loving you all night long 
It's all money ain't nothing wrong 
Dancing loving you all night long 
Easy come easy gone
