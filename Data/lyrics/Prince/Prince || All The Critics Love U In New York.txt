U can dance if U want 2 - All the critics love U in New York
U don't have 2 keep the beat, they'll still think it's neat - in New York
U can wear what U want 2, it doesn't matter - in New York
U could cut off all your hair, I don't think they'd care - in New York

All the critics love U in New York

Why U can play what U want 2 - All the critics love U in New York
They won't say that u're naive if U play what U believe - in New York
Purple love-amour is all u're headed 4 - but don't show it
The reason that you're cool
Is 'cuz you're from the old school, and they know it

All the critics love U in New York

U can dance if U want 2 - All the critics love U in New York
U can dance if U want 2 - All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U, all the critics love U
All the critics love U in New York

It's time 4 a new direction
It's time 4 jazz 2 die
4th day of November
We need a purple high

Don't give up - I'll still love U

All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U, all the critics love U
All the critics love U in New York

Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit

([fuck me over])

All the critics love U, all the critics love U
All the critics love U in New York

Whaddayou lookin' at, punk?
Look out all U hippies, U ain't as sharp as me
It ain't about the trippin', but the sexuality - turn it up

U can dance if U want 2

All the critics love U in New York

All the critics love U in New York

(Yes, we're certain of it, he's definitely masturbating)

All the critics love U in New York
Take a bath, hippies!
All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U in New York
All the critics love U in New York
New York
New York
New York
New York
New York
