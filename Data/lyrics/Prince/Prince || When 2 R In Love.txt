
So fair she looked tonight,
The brightest star appeals to your sex.
Before we do anything,
Let me just talk 2 U.

When 2 R in love
They whisper secrets
Only they 2 can hear
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love (love)
Their stomachs will pound
Every time the other comes near
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love
Falling leaves will appear 2 them
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)

When 2 R in love
The speed of their hips
Can be faster than a runaway train

Drop, drop, drop, drop, water, water, water

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?

When 2 R in love
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
Of penetration (let alone the act)
Let alone the actual act

When 2 R in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
(Love) in love - can U hear me?

(hold me)
(yeah)
(just like that)
(don't move)
