
What's the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing U down?
Is the mailman jerking U 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check
In someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Was it a boy when U wanted a girl? (Boy when u wanted a girl)
Don't U know straight hair ain't got no curl (No curl)
Life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody living there? (Anybody living there)
U can't get over, if U say U just don't care (Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school
And I'll show U a boy aware!
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

What U putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes (Is that where your money goes)
The river of addiction flows
U think it's hot, but there won't be no water
When the fire blows
Dig it

Everybody wants to be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it
