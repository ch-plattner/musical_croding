That you really don't give a damn
They say you really put me down
When I'm doing the best I can
I gave you all of my love
I even gave you my body
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?
What more do you want me to do?
I play the fool when we're together
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
I couldn't do you no better
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

You know, I try so hard
To keep you satisfied
Sometimes you play the part
Sometimes you're so full of pride
And if it's still good to ya
Why you wanna treat me so bad?
You used to love it when I'd do you
You used to say I was the best you'd ever had

I play the fool when we're together
I give you everything I can, yeah
And if it's still good to ya
There's something that I can't understand

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
