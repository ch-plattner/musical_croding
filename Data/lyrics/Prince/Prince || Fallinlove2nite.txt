Don’t, don’t you wanna
Fall in love tonight
She said, don’t, don’t you wanna
Fall in love tonight
Special night, my favorite crew
The moon threatened to dance her out of her shoes
In his ear, he was about to hear
An offer that he could not refuse

She said...

Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight

She said...

Underneath the taffeta
There ain’t no better hiding place
If I see the moon, I’ll just laugh at her
Wanna wake up to your, your pretty face

Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light

She said...

We can sleep all day tomorrow
Dream about this fantasy, fantasy
We don’t have to backspin, apologize, or borrow
Uh, ’bout to go hard, y’all ready for me

Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light
