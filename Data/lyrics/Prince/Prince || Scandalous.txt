
Come. Closer.
Feel what U've been dyin' 4
Don't be afraid, baby
Touch it and explode
Understand, understand that I love U
But more than that - I want U
Everybody always told me
"Good things come 2 those who wait"
But I've got so much on the menu
I just can't wait, I just can't, I can't wait baby
I can't wait baby
I can wrap my legs around U girl
Cuz sugar, U know U're just the kind of lover
That I've been looking 4
2 night why don't we skip all the 4 play, mamma
And just get down here on the floor

Scandalous
I'm talkin' about U and me
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see
Anything U've ever dreamed of
I'm willing 2 be
2 night it's gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy

My dearest, my dearest

(Whisper) Whisper a question
With my body (body) I'll scream a reply
Anything's acceptable
Just ask me and I'll try it
2 hell with hesitation
2 hell with the reasons why

Scandalous
I'm talkin' about U and me
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see
Anything U've ever dreamed of
I'm willing 2 be
2 night it's gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy

Baby, baby, baby

Oh girl, the things U make me do!
Genius is the only way 2 describe U
Anything U've ever dreamed of baby
Just ask me - I'll do, I'll do,
I'll do it 4 U baby

Anything at all
Spirits rise and spirits fall
Anything U ever dreamed off, I'm willing 2 be
2 night is gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2 night I'm, 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy!

Scandalous
I'm talkin' about U and me
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see
Anything U've ever dreamed of
I'm willing 2 be
2 night it's gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy

Scandalous, marvelous
