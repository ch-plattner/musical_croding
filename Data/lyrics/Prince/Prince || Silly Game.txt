I never thought U would be the one
That I'd wanna run 2
I never thought U would be the one
That would make me care
And even tho U done me wrong
4 some strange reason I can't xplain
I get happy knowing U phoned
Cuz your voice could kill my every pain
Why do we play this silly game?

I never thought U would be the one
That I'd wanna give 2
A diamond ring, anything that U ask me 2
But there U were, bragging 2 your friends
Making up a story that's so lame
That I was down 2 be your sugardaddy
One way ticket to ghetto fame
Why do we play this silly game?

Every other night U weren't at home
Out in the streets, just acting grown
Never with a bodyguard or chaperone
Then I hear a rumour that breaks my heart
Instead of taking care of yourself
U're tearing yourself apart
Now why U wanna
(Why U wanna, why U wanna ...)
Now why U wanna go and do that, love?

Why do we play this silly game?

I never thought U would be the one
(That I'd wanna run 2) that I'd wanna run 2
I never thought U'd be the one
That would make me care
No matter how far I run
I'll never be the same (I'll never be the same)
In the end, in the end, there's only us 2 blame
Why do we play this ...
Why do we play this silly ...
Why do we play this silly game?

Yeah
Ooh-ooh
Tell me why? (Tell me why?)
Oh why? (Oh why?)
Oh why - why?

Why do we play this silly game?
Game
