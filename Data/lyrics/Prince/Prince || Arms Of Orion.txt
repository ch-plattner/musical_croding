'2 hold us both together'
'Although we're worlds apart'
'I'd cross the stars 4 U'

"In the heart of a sleepless moon"
"I'll be with U 4 ever"
"This is my destiny"
"'Till my life is through"

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

'When I am lost and feeling alone'
'I just look to heaven'
'I find my comfort there'
'God only knows where U are 2 night'

"God only knows where U are 2 night"
"Maybe time will tell me"
"'Till then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer 4 U"
('I'll say a prayer 4 U 2')

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

Orion's heart is bright enough
2 shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
2 light the way 4 love

'Orion's arms are wide enough'
2 hold us both together
"Although we're worlds apart"
('I'd cross the stars 4 U')
"I'd cross the stars 4 U"

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
"Since U've been gone I've been drowning" ('lost')
"In the sea of tranquility" ('lonely')
"Drowning without U here my dear" ('baby')

'The arms of Orion'
'That's where I wanna be'
'That's where I wanna be' ("the arms of Orion")
'That's where I wanna be' ("the arms of Orion")
'Since U've been gone, babe'
"Since U've been gone"
"I've been drowning", ('drowning'), "drowning"
Drowning without your love
"The arms of Orion" ('arms of Orion')
