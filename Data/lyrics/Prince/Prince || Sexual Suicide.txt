
Baby, U take a walk
Take a walk and leave me behind
Baby, U gonna walk, yeah
Gonna walk right out of your mind
U better have 2 feet
We got no reason, reason 2 lie
Baby, U take a walk
Think I'm gonna take a sexual suicide

Baby, if U only knew
All the love, want a love that's deep in my heart
Ooh baby, bein' here with U
Wouldn't be nothin' could tear us apart
Alright, uh, every night
Cool surrender, lost in your arms
U, U'll be surprised
Doin' it in the cuffs, sound your alarm
Baby, gonna take a walk
Think I'm gonna take a sexual suicide

No body like my body, baby
Ain't no ride like my ride
Super skin in my car, baby
If U're drivin' me, then maybe
Sexual suicide

Ain't it a shame
That U won't play the game
Got 2 much pride
U, U make your bed
But U got 2 see the sexual, sexual suicide
Suicide, sexual, sexual suicide

U take a walk
We can talk
