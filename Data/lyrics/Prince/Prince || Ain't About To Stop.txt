[Prince:]
Closed over, day done
New day is dawning and the fun has just begun
Onto the next generation X
Didn't leave me nothing and nobody to respect
Looking to be proud, dirty projects
Hoping, hungry, feed my stomach
Y'all can see my mom's chest

[Prince:]
I come from north Minny
And I never run from any
And I ain't about 2 stop right now

[Prince & Rita Ora:]
If your life is a B-side, my dream is the A
I got a rockstar, celebration cannot drink away
I come from north Minny
And I never run from many
And I ain't about 2 stop right now
Ain't about 2 stop, ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop, and I ain't about 2 stop right now
Ain't about 2 stop, ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop right now

[Rita Ora:]
Low class, in the past
From the bottom up, we gettin' rough and kickin' ass
Never fail, cause see these females
We still gotta little bit of dirt on Nicki's hundred dollar nails
Ladies, fashion, once I get the cash in
Nothing is too good for Rita if she got the passion

[Prince:]
I come from north Minny
And I never run from any
And I ain't about 2 stop right now

[Prince & Rita Ora:]
If your life is a B-side, my dream is the A
I got a rockstar, celebration cannot drink away
I come from north Minny
And I never run from many
And I ain't about 2 stop right now
Ain't about 2 stop, ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop, and I ain't about 2 stop right now
Ain't about 2 stop, ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop right now

[Prince & Rita Ora:]
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, Ritabot, Ritabot

[Prince & Rita Ora:]
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Ain't about 2 stop, ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop
Ain't about 2 stop right now
Pick out my clothes
