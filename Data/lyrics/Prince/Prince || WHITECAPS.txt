
I saw whitecaps on the water today
Fifteen minutes after you went away
Couldn't find a reason to make you stay
It's windy now, but it's gonna be okay

I saw a black butterfly lose its wings today
Singed by the candle underneath the archway
Wherever they land, they'll have to stay
Who can say, but what a price to pay

Whitecaps on the water
But that's okay
Ain't never been a storm I'm runnin' from
Come my way
Weather man said it would be easy
Over in a day
It's windy now, but it's gonna be okay

For the life of me, I just can't recall
It's still a mystery, that's
â€˜Cause dark gallows lead to brighter halls
And masquerade, masquerade

Whitecaps on the water
But that's okay
Ain't never been a storm I'm runnin' from
Come my way
Weather man said it would be easy
Over in a day
It's windy now, but it's gonna be okay

I saw whitecaps on the water today
Fifteen minutes after you went away
