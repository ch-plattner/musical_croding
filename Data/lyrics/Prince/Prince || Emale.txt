Ooh aah ooh [x2]
The emale left so clearly upon a computer screen
Read like a threat that crept into her like a sex machine
Wanted: Any woman who's first name begins with a "Z"
From the sound of the keys, a pawn makes a move
Her reply brings on the groove

The king takes the pawn

It's on, it's on, it's on!

He couldn't wait 2 tell her 'til after he got the nella
Her love would only even the score
It seemed her darling fella
He stole a hellalotta bucks from the corner store
The declaration of war that followed
She never believed, oh

In the darkest corners where widows mourn
That's where he whispered her name
He said, "We can do it here, my dear
But I fear your tears will fall like rain"
They fall like...

"Because I must tell U (Tell U)
While I'm deep in your smell
U got the man I want 2 inflict with pain
I'm running a game with my paper
I'm turning the boy 2 vapor
Now I wanna do the same 2 U
If U don't tattoo my name upon your train"
