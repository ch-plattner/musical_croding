
There's nothing for the record
And nothing to condemn
It's in between this waking life
And REM
But you walked into the party
To tell me to live up to our dreams
We 'bout to get it started
Turn my guitar up so I can make this woman scream!
So I can make this woman scream!

It's time to check your cell phone
Red Bull and Patr√≥n
Ain't no rapper tryna be a singer
Gonna make her moan
Sade and Babyface
R&B ain't got no place
Put some hard rock on
You better cover your ears
Cause you're about to hear a woman just scream!
Scream!

She said if I don't ever get to kiss you
I'm really gonna make a scene
I said damn you just want me to be
Another rip in your jeans
That's when she ordered strawberries, chocolate and whipped cream
My [?] all turned up
And this woman screamed, screamed, screamed, screamed, screamed

She likes to party hard
She's a HardRockLover
Party hard
She's a HardRockLover now
She likes to party hard
She's a HardRockLover
Party hard
She's a HardRockLover now

Party hard
She's a HardRockLover
Party hard
She's a HardRockLover now
