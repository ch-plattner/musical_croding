As war drums beat in Babylon 
Cinnamon girl starts 2 pray 
Eye've never heard a prayer like this 1 
Never b4 that day 

Tearful words of love 4 people she had never met b4 
Asking God 2 grant them mercy in this face of a holy war 

Cinnamon Girl 

Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage 
Never knew the meaning of color lines 
911 turned that all around 
When she got accused of this crime 

So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi 
What's the use when the god of confusion keeps on telling the same lie? 

Cinnamon Girl 

Don't cry, don't shed no tears 
1 night won't make us feel 
Cause we know how this movie's ending 

Cinnamon Girl 

As war drums beat in Babylon 
And scorch the blood red sky 
Militants bomb the foreign gun 
Both sides truly die 

Cinnamon girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores 
Then she prays after the war that there will not b anymore 

Cinnamon Girl
