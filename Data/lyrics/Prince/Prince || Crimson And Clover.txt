Ouh uuuh
Come on
I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
I hope she walks over
Cuz I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and Clover
Over and over
Baby, I think I love you
I want to know for sure
Come here and stick it to me one time
You move me
Such a sweet thing
Makes me want to sing
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Uh
Baby I, I think I love you
But I want to know for sure
O come here, stick it to me one time
Ah .. you don't move me (?)
Look up!
