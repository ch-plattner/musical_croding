All the things people say, controversy
Am I black or white?
Am I straight or gay? Controversy

I can't understand
Human curiosity, controversy
Was it good for you?
Was I what you wanted me to be?

Do you get high?
Does your daddy cry?

Some people wanna die
So they can be free

Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven

Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us

Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever
