
Damned if I do
Tell me what's up with the teenage indecision
I'm mad in love but U won't give me permission
U said, "Be here at 9"
Then scream at me 4 not giving U more time, more time

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
U say U want me 2 love U
But when I try, U won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye

Damned if I do

Tell me the truth, how many U do it 2?
I smell vermouth everytime I don't get 2 kiss U
Enough's enough
If U don't want my lovin', then I'll give up, I'll give up

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
U say U want me 2 love U
But when I try, U won't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye

Goodbye

Damned if I don't try 2 make U see yourself the way I do
Open minded, worldly, always ready 4 taboo
Tell me what's up, are we gonna go 2 heaven?
I'll fill your cup, I won't do it like Kevin

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
U say U want me 2 love U
But when I try, U won't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Maybe we should say, "I do"

Tu siempre estas hablando de lo que tenemos que hacer
(U're always speaking about what we should do)
Bueno, tu sabes
(Well, U know)
Pero lo que tienes que hacer
(But what U should do)
Que? (What?)
Es buscarte una menta para la boca porque apestas!
(Is get a breath mint because your mouth stinks!)
Que es lo que tu estas diciendo?
(What are U saying?)
Por favor... cometelas todas!
(Please... eat them all!)
A mi no me apesta la boca!
(My breath doesn't stink!)
