If ur Last December came
What would u do?
Would anybody remember
2 remember u?

Did u stand tall?
Or did u fall?
Did u give ur all?

Did u ever find a reason
Y u had 2 die?
Or did u just plan on leaving
Without wondering y?

Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did u feel redeemed?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one

Did u love somebody
But got no love in return?
Did u understand the real meaning of love?
That it just is and never yearns?

When the truth arrives
Will u b lost on the other side?
Will u still b alive?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one

In ur life did u just give a little
Or did u give all that u had?
Were us just somewhere in the middle?
Not 2 good, not 2 bad?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as ONE
