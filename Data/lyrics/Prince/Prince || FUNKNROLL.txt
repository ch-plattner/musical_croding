So finally beloved we meet at last
Middle of the here, nevermind the past
Only way to get to where you never been
Is to party like you ain't gonna party again

[Chorus:]
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll

Whether you are coming by bus or train
Shade throwers hating like they're going insane
Million dollar party to their nickel and dime
Another mother further you're committing a crime

[Chorus]

Only way to last 'til the break of dawn
Put your phone down now and get your party on
Who you gonna call when it's obvious dear?
Everyone you know is rocking up in here, so let's funk

[Chorus]
