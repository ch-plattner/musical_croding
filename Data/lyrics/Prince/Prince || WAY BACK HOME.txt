
Any person or object whatsoever
That requires your attention
Is something that has veered
from its path
And preordained destiny
of total enlightenment

I never wanted a typical life
scripted role, huh...trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to b left alone
See my beds made up at night
Cuz in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find, trying to find
My way back, back home

So many reasons why
There's so many reasons why
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
Without fear I am
Gonna conquer with no fear
Until I find my way back home
Until I find my way back home
Find my way back home

Most people in this world are born dead
But I was born alive
I was born with this dream
With a dream outside my head
That I could find my way back home
My my way way back home

Is this the way?

Power to the ones, power to the ones
who could raise a child like me
The path was set
But if u look the truth will set us free
I've heard about those happy endings
But it's still a mystery
Lemme tell u about me
I'm happiest when I can see
My way back home
Can u see my way back home
Can u see my way back home
