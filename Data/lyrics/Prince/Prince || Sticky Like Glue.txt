
Wheels go down
There but I'm loving another dream of you
All night long
Out of town
I had to go but now I need a cup of some
Black and strong
Beside me
I was used to waking up with you here
Now you're gone
Why oh why
Didn't you hurry along with me this time?
Right or wrong
As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinking about you, baby
When we're together, everything is cool
Beautiful, lover, friend
I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky like glue
Bright blue eyes
Staring down into mine saying, "Good morning,
How are you?"
I can't lie
Waking up in a plane without a warning
Ain't too cool
Cast ashore
Without a paddle and no more excuses
We just drown
What's the score?
If you're still willing to lose then
Come around
As a matter of fact, I just can't live without you, baby
I'm wondering if you feel the same way, too
I'm hugging this pillow tight
The way we did last night
The sweat of each other sticky like glue
Sticky, sticky. 1,2...
That was the coolest movie ever
The one we saw last night
The closer you got to me, the less we saw, alright
The scene you remember most is none of 'em
That ain't a boast, girl
I'm just in front of them others
I am a gracious host
Everybody under me, make a toast
As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinking about you, baby
When we're together, everything is cool
Beautiful, lover, friend
I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky like glue
Break down...
I got something I wanna say to you, baby
You might wanna dig me later
I think you better dig me now
Listen..I can't get to sleep unless your body is right here next to me
It's crazy, baby
I know it's dysfunctional, but I just can't see myself with another girl
Oh, what in the world is wrong with me?
Tell me what to do
Is it me or you?
We fight so much, and then we're through
It might come as a shock to you
But I still love you. Yes, I do.
Don't you think I ain't when I am
One more thing and then I'm out
You get us wet with your pride
Then you hang us both outside to cry cry
What's that sound?
Said it must be raining raining tears tears tears
But you need to try. Please, please don't cry
Cause I ain't going nowhere.
