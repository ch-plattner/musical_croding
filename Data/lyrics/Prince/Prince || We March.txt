Uno para todos, y todos para uno [One 4 all and all 4 one]
March, we march

(Whoa) [x6 in BG]
March, we march [x2]

If this is the same avenue my ancestors fought 2 liberate
How come I can't buy a piece of it even if my credit's straight?
If all the water's dirty and I wanna lay the pipe, my dammy
The river that I drink from, will it be the same as your mammy?

Now's the time 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marchin' 4

If this is the same sister that U cannot stop calling a bitch (Bitch)
It will be the same one that will leave your broke ass in a ditch (Ditch)
If U can't find a better reason 2 call this woman otherwise
Then don't cry, U made the bed in which U lie

Now's the time 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marchin' 4

(Whoa) [x4 in BG]
March, we march (Come on)
March, we march
Yes we do!

Dig..
Now we clarify 4ever, in other words as long as it takes
We ain't got no use 4 ice cream without the cake (Umm)
We ain't got no time 4 excuses, the promised land belongs 2 all
We can march in peace but U best watch your back if another leader falls

March, we march
[Feet stompin'!]
March, we march

He said it, she said it and I say...
Now's the time (now's the time) 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason (Yeah) and frees the mind (free your mind)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line (Get in line!)
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)
All is what were marchin' 4 (Whooaa)

Next time we march (Oh yeah) (Whoa)
Kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)
All is what were marchin' 4

The fun don't stop the bacon
That's when the money gonna stop the shakin'

I know that next time we march, yeah
