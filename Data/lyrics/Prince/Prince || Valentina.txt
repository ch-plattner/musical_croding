She should give me a call 
When she get tired of runnin' 
After you down the hall 
B4 you came on2 the scene it was a hollywood mess 
Ur mama was a movie queen 
She was one of the best 

Every boy had the hots 4 her, 
Around the world even girls adored her 
Mexican bombshell 
Come 2 conquer the west 

Hey valentina tell ur mama 
She should give me a call 
When she get tired of runnin' 
After you down the hall 
And she's all worn out 
From those late night feedings 
And she ready 4 another 
Rock 'n roll meeting 
Oh valentina tell ur mama 
She should give me a call 

Ur uncle sam used 2 hold it down 
Every day 

Watch the bootyguards 
Scarecrow the buzzards away 
Like an aeroplane the time flies over 
So many guys they couldn't get 
Ur sweet little mama 2 stay 

Curvier than 
A fender stratocaster guitar... 
Reality bender... from no greencard 
2 superstar 

Broken up slang even when 
The king of hollywood ain't that tall 
Sho as betty's ugly 
Ur mama's bigger than 'em all 
Hey valentina 

Tell ur mama she should call up mia 
In advance 

If penelope wants 2 cruz 
There ain't no way that we ain't gon dance 
Tell ur mama should should give me a call 
That's all
