Seems 2 happen 2 me each and every time we make love
I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn u, baby u're so fine
Damn this kooky love affair
All I ever want 2 do is play in your hair
2 people crazy in love
Into 1 another like a hand in a glove
Damn this kooky love affair
(damn u)

Like animals just born 2 breed
Come 2 think about cha baby
U're my only need
I'm on fire 'til u come and put me out
All I'm trying 2 say is that my psychadelic shouts
When u damn me
Damn u
When I'm in your arms it's all that I can do
When we're makin' love, I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn u, baby u're so fine

Damn u, baby u're so fine

That one's dedicated 2 all the lovers
That was beautiful
This one's dedicates 2 the whores
What you just...
Pimprag, check (pimprag)
Just once will you talk to me?
Tootsie pop, check (tootsie pop)
Not at me, not around me, not through me?
Raise your cane (cane)
What do you believe in?
God
Who is your God?
U
Is this reality or just another facade?
