
A few months ago or maybe it was years
It was a heartbreak and so many tears
How she gonna make it out here on her own
A body like that should never be alone
A kiss on the stairway, another manâ€™s embrace
How was she in know, just what was taking place?
Too busy with the jugular and how it taste
To remember what she saw in the X's face

The X's face
The X's face

Long time ago or maybe yesterday
You and I in chariots, on our way
Proper celebration for what we've learned
But for every battle won, there are scars and burns
For every broken heart, there's another will mend
Who needs enemies when you got friends
For every open door there's something in the way
Last time we checked it was the X's face

The X's face
The X's face

Everybody know about the X's face
Black don't crack
Bass don't bate
Go and take that banana
Then get back in your cage
Oh Lord
Ooh ooh ah hah ah ah
The X's face
Go and take that banana, take it
The X's face
Get it, I said you could have it
Oh no
The X's face
