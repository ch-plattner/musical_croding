It was only because I'd never held your hand
That was part of the plan
I had 2 get it right if I was 2 be your man
And if I ever kissed your lips
I needed time 2 cross the others off my list (off my list)
A higher high 2 the trip (trip)
I wanted U 2 go, that was my wish - yes it was

(Ooh my) Friend, lover, sister, mother/wife
Air, food, water, love of my life

If I ever shared a bed
It was only cuz I wanted 2 live up 2 what the people said, oh yes
(What they say?) [x5]
Now I'm livin' instead
Everyday just 2 say U're the only one who's in my head
(The only one) [x2]
Oh yes U are

And if I ever made U cry
All I have 2 do is think about it and I just wanna die (I just wanna die)
(I just wanna break down and die, die, die, die)
How I'd ever make it by (I don't know) without U, baby (without U, baby)
I don't know (No!), I hope I never have 2 try, yeah
(Please don't ever leave me)
Oh, listen 2 me

(Ooh my) Friend, lover, sister, mother/wife
(My sweet, sweet friend, lover, sister, mother/wife)
Air, food, water, love of my life

The eyes of my child I see every time U look at me
(I see a sweet baby smile)
A sweet baby smile like a light that shines 4 all 2 see

(And if I ever held a hand) If I ever held a hand
Oh, 'twas only cuz I'd never held yours
That was part of, part of the plan
I had 2 get it right (right) if I was 2 be your man because...

(Ooh my) Friend, lover, sister, mother/wife
(Friend, lover, sister, mother/wife)
My, my, my, my air, my food, my water, love of my life (I love U)
(Everlasting life)

Teacher (teacher), healer (healer), feeler (feeler), sight 4 sore eyes
(Let me look at your eyes - U're so pretty)
Oh, yes U are, baby
(Ooh my) Don't U know U're my friend, my lover, my sister, love of my life (mother/wife)
Yeah, baby, yes U are

["Te amo" is "I love U"]
(Ooh my) Friend (te amo), lover (te amo), sister (te amo), mother/wife
(Hug me, hug me, hug me baby, U are my life)
(I'll stay with U 4ever) [x2]
Till death do us part, baby (Yes sir!)

My friend, lover, sister, mother/wife
