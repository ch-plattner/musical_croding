Everyday is a winding road, is a winding road, is a winding road, oh
(Is a winding road)

I hitched a ride with a Crazyhorse showgirl
She says she's been down this road more than twice (Time)
She wanted 2 know if I could tell the future (Tell the future)
I said, "I've never been there before, but the brochure looks nice"

Jump in, let's go (let's go, baby)
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high (high), everybody gets low (Low)
These R the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer 2 feeling fine
(Oh-oh)
(Listen now)

She's got a daughter she calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering y people feel so all alone (All alone)
Feeling like a stranger in their own life

Jump in, let's go (Let's go, baby)
Lay back (ooh-ooh), enjoy the show
Everybody gets high (High), everybody gets low (Low)
These R the days (Days) when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer 2 feeling fine

(Jump in)
(Everyday is a winding road, is a winding road)

I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on compliments and herbal tea
I've been wondering if all the things I've ever seen
Were ever real (Were ever real, were ever real ...)
Were ever really happening

Jump in, let's go ([...] let's go, baby)
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These R the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road (Come on, come on)
I get a little bit closer (get closer baby)
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer 2 feeling fine

Everyday is a winding road (Is a winding road, is a winding road)
Everyday is a faded sign (Faded sign, let's go)

Da-da, da-da
Everyday, everyday
(Da-da, da-da)
Everyday, everyday
Oh-yeah
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday

Do U love your brother? (Everyday, everyday)
Do U love your sister? (Everyday, everyday)
Do U love us? (Everyday, everyday)
Do U love God? (Everyday, everyday)

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer (ooh, yeah)
Everyday is a faded sign (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Closer)
Everyday is a winding road (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Come on
We can make it
We can New Power Soul
(Dance, dance, dance ...)
Dance on the funk
Dance on the funk

Everyday is a winding road
