Stop it baby

U're a VIP at least 2 me
Come here and show me some ID
Eye know U're fine from head 2 pumps
If U were mine we'd bump bump bump
U're much 2 young 2 peep my stash
U're tryin' 2 write checks Ur body can't cash
U can't hang with this, girl

Lolita
U're sweeter
But U'll never make a cheater out of me

Cool 2gether, yes, eye must admit
Long time ago, we'd be the shh... uh oh
Like Frank and Ava, we'd paint the town
Just on the floor, gettin' way down
Dom Perignon and caviar
The finest clothes and fancy cars
U know, one of them '56 pink caddies, baby!

Lolita
U're sweeter
But U'll never make a cheater out of me

Ur eyes Ur mouth
Ur curly hair
U're bad no doubt
But eye must beware

Lolita 
U're sweeter
But eye won't mislead ya
Eye'll feed ya, if it'll please ya
But then eye'll say c ya
U're a fine, mama mia
But U'll never ever ever
No, U'll never ever ever
No, U'll never make a cheater out of me

Lolita! (yea?)
How bad r u, girl? (bad!)
Then what u wanna do? (whatever u want!)

Imagine me on the tip of Ur tongue
If eye took a sip then eye would be on the run
Hellhounds barkin' 'round my door
Eye can't sip U once 'less eye sip U some more

Lolita
Better get out of here
'Less U wanna dance
