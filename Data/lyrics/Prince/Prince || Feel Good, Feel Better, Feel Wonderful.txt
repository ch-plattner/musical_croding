Eye could tell by the color of ur 
Nrg field 
U thought this game was over 
Chemical peel 
U tried 2 do me like my good brother steve 
But eye got another funky 
Trick up my sleeve 
Expecting me 2 freak on you a little bit more 
But you get nothin but well-wishes 
& flowers galore 
Eye mean no harm 
Eye still got ur back 
U can come and drink my wine 
As a matter of fact 

Just feel better, feel good, feel wonderful 

Eye don't know what you thought 
When you spit in my face 
But this dimension ain't the time 
Or the place 
Eye don't know who told you u could 
Stand next 2 me 
Cuz eye got a guitar that could 
Part the sea 
Don't mean no disrespect 
Eye ain't tryin' 2 brag 
But that might b the same one that 
Tapped on the crag 

And brought 4th the water 
That quenched ur thirst 
And we'll keep feeding ya 
But first things first! 

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful 

If you think about how much time it took 
4 you 2 try 2 get a page in my book 
Eye feel so good right now 
Eye just can't recall 
What the __ eye was thinking when eye 
Threw you the ball 

It hit 3 bystanders after you touched it 
Now they wanna sue me but they love me 2 much 
Cuz they know eye wish them heaven and all of its gold 
Same 2 u, come on let's groove 
2 the purple rock 'n roll 

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful 

Better than good, better than good, 
U know you should feel wonderful 
Keep ur mind in the vertical motion 
Always looking up
