Eye'm just trying 2 get U 2 think about doing things
That U've always wanted but could never find 

Eye'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure (seek and destroy)
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Until eye discover the land beyond expertise and chastity

Eye'm sure U had another lover (another lover)
Let me tell U baby, all trick aside
Eye can get U out of Ur body
Have U ever felt like U were dyin' and felt satisfied?
