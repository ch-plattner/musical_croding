That these hills belonged to her still
And even though injustice took them hills away
"One day we'll get them back," he said
"And the sun's gonna shine that day"
"When we say, right the wrong"

Before she laid him down to rest
She heard his voice in the wilderness
Sayin "I got six feet of it back"
"And now we can right the wrong"

Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long U won't hear nothin' but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would u rather die knowing that u did or keep living in shame

Did you hear the one about the boy just 17
Three years hard time for stealing ice cream
First offence and all his dreams are gone
How long before they right the wrong?

Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long U won't hear nothin' but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would u rather die knowing that u did or keep living in shame

Right the wrong

2, 3, uh

1, 2, 1-2, come on
(Right the wrong baby)

Far be it from me to say
It seem like we could stop the flow of snow in the sky today
But I guess the weather man he likes the rain
Ain't that insane
Now sing

Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long U won't hear nothin' but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would u rather die knowing that u did or keep living in shame?

(Come on, come on, come on)
Did you hear me baby?
Right the wrong
I'm 6 feet in the grave
I'm 6 feet in the grave
(right right, right right)
(right the wrong right the wrong)
(right the wrong right the wrong)
Right the wrong (right the wrong right the wrong)
(right the wrong right the wrong)
(right the wrong right the wrong)
(right the wrong right the wrong)
Right the wrong (right the wrong right the wrong)

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust (right the wrong right the wrong)
This young man with a talented soul (right the wrong right the wrong)
Died when he wanted 2. (right the wrong right the wrong)
The [life/light]that lives (right the wrong right the wrong)
So he shall not be pitied
Nor shall the guity be forgiven
Until they find it in their hearts to
Right the wrong
