If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life
U say u'll call me and then and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Coupled with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
With the undertaker, which one will it be?
U can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

Give back the chains - if you don't you will die
Nothing should come between you and I

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me

If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me
(3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)
Cuz I sho 'nuff say u will

(3 chains o' gold)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)

I've got 3 chains o' gold
They gonna shine...

Forever, forever, forever

(3 chains o' gold)
