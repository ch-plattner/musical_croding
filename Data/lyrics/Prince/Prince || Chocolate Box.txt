So, what's the deal, y you frontin' keep it real 
Do you wanna get funky with me? 
If you think eye got something that you want, 
Suga nothin' here comes 4 free 

Eye been around this way 
Got lost and found 
Lemme c if you remember my name 
U can try 2 get it but eye can't let you hit it 
Cuz you never gon' b the same 

Eye got a box a chocolates 
That'll rock the sox of any 
Girl that wanna come my way 
And eye ain't got no time 2 waste 
If she ain't makin' bank and scared of 
What a brutha got 2 say 

She want the b-o-x-a-chocolate everyday 

So what's the deal r you sportin' some wheels 
Or r you ridin' in a limousine? 
This ain't prom night and eye don't wanna 
Fight so you betta get ur dirty clean 
Eye hear ur words goin' up and down ur 
Skirt ur gonna get a chance 2 prove it 
U best believe if you wanna get wit me 
It takes a real woman 2 do it 

[Chorus (q-tip)]

So what's the deal r you gay or poppin' pills? 
Y you still wanna take my hand? 
This discotech is 'bout 2 make me a wreck 
My feet r singin' louder than the band 
Eye c you got the feelin' 
Flashin' lights up on the ceiling 
Say you gotta get ur weekend now 
What difference does it make? 
U know you can't make chocolate cake 
If ain't nobody ever showed you how 

[Chorus x2]
She want the b-o-x-a-chocolate everyday
