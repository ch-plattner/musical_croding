
It really don't matter who you get with 
Cuz it just ain't meant 2 b 

It really don't matter 
Cuz you never shoulda woulda, 
Even coulda been like me 

Eye can get you what you want anything 
At all girl all you gotta say is please 
Ask ur mother ur sister ur brotha 
There'll never b another 
Never b another like me 

Late afternoon slipped outta my bed 
Turned up the stereo 
About 2 raise the dead 

Slipped in the bathroom 
Put some olive oil in my hair 
Walked in the closet 
Tryin' 2 find something 2 wear 

Then I check my emale 
2 c where the party b 
Change the names 2 protect the guilty 
And get ready 2 creep 
Should eye bring somebody 
Or dance alone? 
It don't matter 2 me u'all 
Cuz 2nite is on 

[Chorus]

Bout a half past ten and eye'm on my way 
Heard you had a fine little puerto rican dj 
If she ain't got prince's new song 
There is gonna b a scene 
Cuz eye can't stand nobody cussin' 
At me when I'm clean 

Arms all around me 
Soon as eye hit the door 
Good thing I ate my spinach 
U're thicker than b4 
Oh what's this boy doing 
Y he makin' that face 
Don't he know eye have crazy friends with me 
Ready 2 tear up this place? 

[Chorus]

Can't you c this is inevitable 
What's the use in wastin' time? 
U and me we could be com4table 
All that takes is 4 you 2 make up ur mind 
So now what's the matter? 
U and me, we both dimes 
Said we were 
All them other pennies should scatter 
We ought not waste this time 
That's y... 

[Chorus]
