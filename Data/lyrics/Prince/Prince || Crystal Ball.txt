Expert lover, my baby
U ever had a Crystal Ball?
Ooh, expert lover, my baby
Ever had a Crystal Ball?
Expert lover, my baby
U ever had a Crystal Ball?

As bombs explode around us and hate advances on the right
The only thing that matters, baby, is the love that we make 2night
As little babies in make-up terrorize the western world
The only thing that matters, baby, is love between a boy and girl

Oh, expert lover, my baby
U ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All 4 fun and fun 4 all

I can't remember my baby's voice cuz she ain't talkin' no more
Only the sound of love and prayer echo from the yellow floor,
yellow floor
Huh, she's sayin' - "Dear Jesus, save us from temptation
Dear Jesus, save us from hell
Save us from the madness that threatens us all
Can U hear us? It's hard 2 tell
In your name we pray"

Expert lover, my baby
Ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All 4 fun, fun 4 all

As soldiers draw swords of sorrow
My baby draws pictures of sex (Yes, she does)
All over the walls in graphic detail - sex!

Everybody say it now
Expert lover, huh, my baby
Ever had a Crystal Ball?
Under... undercover, ha, no maybe
All 4 fun and fun 4 all

The only thing U can be sure of is the love we make 2night
