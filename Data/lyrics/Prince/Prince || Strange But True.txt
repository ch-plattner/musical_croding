
Okay, let me say this quick - before I start 2 cry
U're the only one that I gave it 2, the one I fantasised 4
And time away from U has taught me
What I should have known
That this hole I'm trying 2 fill with another - yeah, it's grown
And I got your package
But when I tried 2 write back I bailed
See, trying 2 express the future, sometimes language fails
And over this time I've learned
My life force is increased by knowing U
Every door that closes, another one opens
Strange but true
Strange but true

No regrets because I forget the unfamiliar faces
Those petty lies and alibis, just golddiggas chasing
Dreams of sovereignty, they tried to come between U and me
A curse therein set forces a chain of events
That only freed me when I remembered
Where I was and who I am
The only Prince that will ever rule this holy land
All understand and all standunder this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God...
All negativity bows
Strange but true, let's see what U can do

U may have lost me, but I found myself
The ones who love me without condition - this is my wealth
And with these words I will win
Repeat them over and over again
All understand and all standunder this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God...
All negativity bows
All negativity bows
All negativity bows

Strange but true, let's see what U can do
Strange but true, let's see what U can do
All negativity bows

(Strange but true)
(Strange but true)
Strange but true (true, true...)
All negativity bows

(Strange but true, let's see what U can do)
All negativity bows
(All negativity bows)
Strange but true
Strange but true

(Strange but true)
(Strange but true)
Strange but true
