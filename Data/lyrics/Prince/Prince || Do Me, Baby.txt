Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around

Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do Me Baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on and do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Here we are looking for a reason
You to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby please stop teasing me

What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

So do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on, do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more
I said

Do do do do me baby
(Do me baby)
Do me baby all night long
(Give it to me)

Do me baby
I want you now
Do me baby
Give it to me

(Do me baby)
Do me baby, don't wanna do it all alone
I want your love
Do me baby
Give it to me

(Do me baby)
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want u now)

You're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you gonna do
You just gonna sit there and watch?
Alright
Are you sure you don't wanna close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not gonna stop until the war is over
Help me!
There okay okay
I'm so cold, just hold me
