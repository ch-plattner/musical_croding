In a pale blue spotlite
A figure spins around a voice calls out 2 u,
"Baby...do you like the sound?"
The undulating acrobat ready 2 do ur bidding says,
"Come, U must let me dress u
But 1st I must do a fitting...
Do u like fast? Or do u like it slow?"

I know it's better if we make it up as we go...
And oh, by the way tell me now what's ur name?
I'll let it sweeten my tongue just once
And never speak it again
Since this is our little secret
Untarnished memory in a pale blue spotlite
Let me hear u scream, if u're ready 4...
One nite alone... with me
