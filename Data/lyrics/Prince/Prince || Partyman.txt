Lawrence..."

Young and old, gather 'round (yeah)

Rock a party like nobody can
Rules and regulations - no place in his nation
Partyman, partyman

Somebody holler if U wanna party

"Ladies and gentlemen, no pictures, please!"

Get it up, oh yeah
Partyman, partyman
Get it up, get it up

I rock the whole world, north, east and south
In the west - 17 horns blowin'

Partyman, partyman

Get it up
All hail the new king in town
