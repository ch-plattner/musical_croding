1-2-3-4!
1-2-3-4! 1-2-3-4!

(Loose!) Everybody wants 2 know what's wrong with U
(Loose!) They see U actin' like a crazy fool
(Loose!) When the music hits U don't know what 2 do
Push your way up 2 the front and shake your motherfuckin' 'do
Loose!

(Loose!)
Fuckin' 'do Loose! (Loose!)

(Loose!) Bangin' gangs, slangin' wangs and rock
(Loose!) Won't gain U nothin' but an angry cop
(Loose!) Get your education first then buy a pair of shoes
Push your way up 2 the front and shake your motherfuckin' 'do
Loose!

(Loose!)
Guitar solo

(Loose!) How the hell U gonna tell me what 2 do?
(Loose!) I got the clothes, I got the bank and the crew
(Loose!) If U look real close, I even got your garden tool
Push your way up 2 the front and shake your motherfuckin' 'do
Loose!

(Loose!)
C'mon everybody
Loose! (Loose!)
