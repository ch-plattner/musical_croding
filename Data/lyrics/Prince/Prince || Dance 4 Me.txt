[Chorus]
Eye like it when you dance cuz it gets me hot 
Eye like it when you shake everything you got 
Eye like it when you dance cuz it's so sexy 
Eye like it when you dance 4 me 

Eye like it when you think eye'm all alone 
Ur the voice eye hear from the telephone 
Tellin me all ur deepest fantasies 
Eye like it when you dance 4 me...hallelujah 

Eye like it when eye hear a knock 
On my door 
U r standing there in ur christian dior 
Dark sunglasses in the pale moonlight 
Eye like it when the scene is right 
U can take ur wrap and lay it on the chair 
If anybody finds it eye don't care 
What we do 2gether makes history 
Eye like it when you dance 4 me 
Hallelujah 

Ur flamenco eyes r all like jazz 
With every other sip of what's in ur glass 
The sexier you get 
The more ur in2 my stash 
Eye like it when you dance for me 
Hallelujah 

(dance... dance 4 me... dance... dance 4 me) 

[Chorus x2]

Dance... dance... eye like it when you dance 4 me
