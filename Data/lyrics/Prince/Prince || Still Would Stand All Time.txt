It's just around the corner, it's just around the block
Vthis love that I've been waiting for, a Love solid as rock
A Love that reaffirms that we R not alone
A Love so bright inside U it glows
And night and day would run together, and all things would b fine
Still would stand all hate around us
Still would stand all time
Still would stand all time

It's not a thousand years away, it's not that far my brother
When men will fight injustice instead of one another
Its not that far if we all say yes and only try
Then Heaven on Earth we will find

(all time)
(still, still would stand all time)

No one man will be ruler, therefore love must rule us all
Dishonesty, anger, fear, jealousy and greed will fall
Love can save us all

Oh, love, Love, oh Love if U would just please give us a sign
Still would stand all time
Heaven, heaven on Earth we all want 2 find (we all want 2 find it)
Still (still) would stand all time

We R not alone people (we're not alone)
Tell me can U see the light (can ya see the light)
If U just open your eyes (still would stand all time)
So much U will know, so much U will show
Love, Love, its not that far away if we all say yes and give it a try
(Got ta give it...a try...yes!) still would stand all time (I say still)
(so many times) so may times, I thought I could not make it
(still would stand all time)
Life was closing in I just knew, I just knew I couldn't take it
That's when Love opened it's arms, and if U dont go in child
Still would stand all time (still would stand all time)
U better run to the light, leave your past behind
All things will be fine
Still would stand all time
