I know U're out there
I can feel Ur eyes on me
Seen that face a 1000 times
If only in my dreams

I know U really want me
I can feel Ur hands on me
I really wanna touch U 2
In a way I'm much 2 shy 2 speak

And even though
I'm all alone
4 what it's worth
U're somewhere here on Earth

And I like it

I know U're out there
I can feel U getting closer 2 me
I'm just wondering what U're waiting 4
U know I am free

In this digital age, U could just page me
I know it's a rage, but it just don't engage me
I like the face to face
Do you want 2 do this at Urs, or my place?

It's been so long
Since I been with somebody
Like a million years
Now U're here on Earth

U're here, U're here

[Renato piano]

Somewhere here on Earth
And I like it, I like it

Listen..

I know U hear me
Like a whisper in Ur ear
U don't have to fear me
U'r everything I hold so dear

I know U already love me
U're probably just 2 cool 2 say
Somebody somewhere put U down
But that's ok, that's ok

Cuz whenever U feel
It's time 2 heal
No, no more
As long as I'm here on Earth
