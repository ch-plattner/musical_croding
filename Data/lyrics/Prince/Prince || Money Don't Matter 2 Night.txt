Unlucky 4 him again
He never had respect 4 money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough
2 treat his lady right
He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter 2 night'

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night

Look, here's a cool investment
They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in ever color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that...

Money don't matter 2 night (don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
And it sure don't matter 2 night

(ooh-wee-ooh, don't matter)
(it don't matter 2 night, no)

Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
2 send a child off 2 war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying 4? (is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live 4
Then long life will come 2 pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And u think u got it bad

Money don't matter 2 night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (make certain that your soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
... it sure don't matter 2 night

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday, yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night
