Because I turned my eye toward U
Because I seek your hand
Every other woman envies U
And me, every other man

A massive circle of jealousy
Is coming round again
Those prickly fingered scallywags
That masquerade as friends

Make a promise this very night
That they will no longer pose
A threat to either 1 of us
Then let the chapter close

For all the midnights, in the world
This 1 will serve us better
If U choose to be my girl

Like Susan's petals
A wonderful life, the 2 of us shall lead
The children of the future've all the
Spiritual food they need

The secrets that the 1s before
With grace, they've come and shown
2gether with love 4 1another
We shall make them known

With the love and happy days
I number the grains of sand
Writing 12 times ever more
If I could be Ur man

Amethyst and rubies
Crystals and black pearls
I trade them all, just to spend with U
All the midnights, in the world

All the midnights, in the world
