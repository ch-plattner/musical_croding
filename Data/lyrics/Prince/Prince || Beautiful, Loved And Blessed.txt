
Wake up
Ur beautiful, loved and blessed
Feel me? (I think I do)

When U found me I was just a piece of clay
I was 4mless, U gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)

But 2 much power (tell it)
Can can sometimes turn 2 shame
2 much desire
Sometimes makes U feel the same (come on)
But 4giveness is how U win the game
I begged 4 truth, now I know the truth
And that is when U came and said I was...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day b4
Cause U made me confess that I am...
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're really free indeed
All U gotta do is just plant the seed

A constant battle 2 stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying 2 break U down
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up
I just wanna b happy
Come take this bitter cup from me

If I were ever 2 write my life story
I could truly say through all the pain and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
Cause when U whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day b4
Cause U made me confess that I am...
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're really free indeed
All U gotta do is just plant the seed

Everything U made U said, "That's good"
B4 the fall of man U said, "That's good"
Everytime I walk in faith, that's good
U let me see another day, that's good
B4 the earth was made U said,
"Tamar, I will lead the way and U'll go far"
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U rescue me from the darkness
And our heart just must confess
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're free indeed
All U gotta do is just plant the seed

Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say

Beautiful, loved and blessed
U rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I always pass the test

That's what I am, beautiful
That's what I am, beautiful
I don't mean 2 put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am...
Beautiful, that's what I am
That's what I am
When U wanna give up, don't cause U know
U always got a friend

That's what I am, that's what i am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
That's what I am, that's what i am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
