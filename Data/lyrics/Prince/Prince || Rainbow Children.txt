The Rainbow Children

Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise,
Flying upon the wings of the New Translation
See them fly, fly
The covenant will b kept this time
Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise

Rainbow children, it's time 2 rise!
Rainbow children, it's time 2 rise!

As prophesied, the Wise One and his woman were tempted by the Resistor. He, knowing full well the Wise One's love 4 God, assimilated the woman first and only. Quite naturally, chaos ensued and she and 5 others were banished from the rainbow.4ever.

Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise
Flying upon the wings of the New Translation
See them fly, fly
The covenant will b kept this time
Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise

Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise
Flying upon the wings of the New Translation
See them fly, fly
The covenant will b kept this time
Just like the sun, the Rainbow Children rise

Who is ur real father?
The everlasting one
The one who came from nothing
And yet from this one, everything comes

The one who commands ur momma
With the simple phrase "I am"
And every time that she obeys
She gives birth 2 the Son of Man
Who is this?

Reproduction of the new breed leader/Stand up and organize!
Reproduction of the new breed leader/Stand up and organize!

The Agreement -
With every birth, we keep it so/Never changing one piece of it
In fear of what would unfold/The scales would then become unbalanced
And thus would begin the fall/The sin of one would become
The sin of one and all

Rise, rise, rise.
Rise, Rainbow Children, rise
Rise, Rainbow Children, rise

The Wise One who understood the law that was handed down from God long ago, held fast in his belief that the Lord would bring him another one who loved him so.
