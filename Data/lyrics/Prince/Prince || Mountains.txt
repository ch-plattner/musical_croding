Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
17 mountains stood so high.
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made u cry
U said the devil told u that another mountain would appear
Everytime somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would 1 day overflow with all your tears,
And love will always leave u lonely

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
happiness sometimes hard 2 find. (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air,
it's enough to make you want to lose your mind

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (Oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Guitars and drums on the 1

(Bobby on the drum - ah!)

It's only mountains (oh yeah) and the sea. (and the girls sing)
There's nothing greater, u and me

[starvation]

Mountains
