Hollyrock ain't all it seems (Lordy)
Don't get 2 serious, it's just a dream
Don't forget your friends, they're all U've got (Lordy)
Listen 2 the story of a man I am not

Party all night, hangin' out
In the streets more than I be at home
I take a pill 2 wipe away my doubts
But a pill can't cure my bein' alone
Vodka and 7 straight 2 my brain
Put me under false impressions, hide all my pain
Somebody help me, I'm losing control

This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!

Everybody got the big dreams (Hey Lordy)
But nobody got the bucks
Love and trust will help U make it in a world (Everybody)
Where there ain't no love, ain't no love

Dig...
A man came up 2 me, smile in his eyes
He told me I was a saint
So I'm quittin' my friends much 2 their surprise
I can't live up 2 the picture that they paint
Ah somebody help me, I'm losing control (Ow!)

I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!

Lordy
La, la, la, la, la (Sucker)
Got 2 drive
(It's just a dream) [x3]
Look out

Do U wanna party?
Do want a pill?
How about a false impression?
(Thrills, spills, chills)

This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!

Ow! Yeah
Up a little bit
(Dream factory, oh)
Party all night, hang up on the side, I said "Uh"
(Do U wanna party?)
I can't make up my mind
(How about a false impression?)
I can't seem 2 live with no pictures (Thrills, spills, chills)
Somebody got 2 help me! (Just a sucker)
I'm losing control (Just a sucker)
I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!

Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!
(Just a sucker, motherfucker!)
