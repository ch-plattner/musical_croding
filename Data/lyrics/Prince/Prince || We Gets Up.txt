Come on!

We gets up, everybody get down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come 2 your town
I said the lost is found

We gets up - ain't no need 2 trip
We're the one deserving of the championship
We gets up - so U feel the gift
All the competition, they got 2 quit

We gets up, everybody get down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come 2 your town
I said the lost is found

Yeah! How U think we comin'?
Smash em' like U wanna sting

We just bad - we so bad, we good
Comin' 2 wreck shop in your neighborhood
NPG - and we're makin' it understood
Ain't no one can stop us, how U think U could?

We gets up, everybody get down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come 2 your town
I said the lost is found

Yeah, NPG, New Power Soul, K-k-k-kick it!

Oh yeah!
Gimme the break, gimme the break, huh

If y'all take a left, we gonna go right
But we'll keep this mutha rockin' till the broad daylight

People, wave your hands
Ain't nobody better in all of the land
See them go ...[boom]! Yeah, we crushin' the man
That don't believe we get up, yes we can!
We gets up, up, up, up!

Oh yeah! [x2]

We gets up, everybody get down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come 2 your town
I said the lost is found

We gets up [x5] (Oh yeah)
Alright

We gets up!
