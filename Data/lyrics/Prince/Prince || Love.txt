
Stop telling me what U want me 2 hear
Stop telling me what U want me 2 fear
Stop trippin' on something U overheard
Love is winning without a word
Stop giving me Ur "wish list"
Love is free from all this

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... whatever... U want it 2 b

Love is not a game U can play on the floor
U gotta stop keepin' score
If U wanna, If U want 2 play me like U did b4
U better stop and walk out the door
U can skate around the issue if U like
But who's gonna get U high in the middle of the night?

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... whatever... U want it 2 b

I c U standing with Ur back on the wall
U better, better get Ur hands up and clap if that's all
And uh, if U don't wanna get Urs, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna b no drama 'cause we have a good time

What's the point of giving me ultimatums?
Smiling at my friends when U really hate 'em
Trying 2 convince me that eye should 2...
What's the point?

Stop worryin' about what people say
When it ain't gonna stop them anyway
Love can do anything if U try
Come on... Spread Ur wings... Let's fly, fly so high

Flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... whatever... whatever...

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... whatever... U want it 2 b

Whatever U want it 2 B
Alright
Let's skate

I c U standing with Ur back on the wall
Better get Ur hands up and clap if that's all
If U don't wanna get Urs, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna b no drama 'cause we have a good time

Bounce

Ahh, bounce it baby
Aww, shake that thing c'mon
Good god
