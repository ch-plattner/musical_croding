Hot with U

I wanna get hot with U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doing things U thought U'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U

I wanna get hot with U [4x]

I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna get U underneath the cream
And do the marshmallow
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U
I wanna get U 2 do something
U thought U'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night ... nude
I wanna get hot with U

I wanna get hot with U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doing things U thought U'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U

I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna make U climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in U ...
I wanna get hot with U

I wanna get hot with U [4x]

Know the body banging, got U singing
No shouts from the neighbours, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now U know U can't stop her
Trying to turn me on - I never had this, so stop this
I'm supposed 2 tremble cuz they call U 'The Artist'?
Let's wild out - can U handle ruff riding?
Treat U like a freak of the week and had U hiding from me
I can do whatever U like, if U could take it
If I could be your girlfriend, U could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think I'm ready 4 U 2 make me an example
I mean - come on - why front on
I'd never place time - queen in your life
I mean - will never
The days that U feeling for me ... neutral
That I'm ready 2 call U daddy
Even get got with U

Meet me early morning in a 4th dimension plane
Astral travelling hottie, I know U know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet U
And then we'll rearrange
Everything U know of love
I'll give U reason 2 change

Hot with U
I wanna get hot with U
(I wanna, wanna ...)
I wanna get hot with U
(I want U)

I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room, yeah
That's what I wanna do, eye-eye
I wanna get hot with U
Hot with U, ooh

I wanna get hot with U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doing things U thought U'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U

Take a drive 2 the ocean
And drown U in a wave (Hot with U)
Of 100,000 compliments, boo
I want U every day (Hot with U)
And 2 be cool
And the only way 2 do that is every night (hot with U)
Get hot, get hot (Hot) with U (Hot)
Yeah baby

I wanna get hot with U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doing things U thought U'd never do (Never)
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room (Oh, honey)
Multicolored lights and an ocean view (Can't U see)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U

Hot with U
(I wanna get hot with U)

I wanna get hot with U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doing things (ooh) U thought U'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh" (ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with U

Wanna get hot with U
