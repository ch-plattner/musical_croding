And He was just another
Another nice guy
What if you're right
What if it's true
They say the truth
Will only make a fool of you
And what if that's true?

What if He takes His place in history
With all the prophets and the kings
Who taught us love and came in peace
But then the story ends, what then

But what if you're wrong
What if there's more
What if there's hope
You never dreamed of hoping for
What if you jump?
Just close your eyes
What if the arms that catch you
Catch you by surprise?
What if He's more than enough?
What if it's love?

[Hannah Welton:]
What if you dig
Way down deeper
Than your
Simple-minded friends
What if you dig
And what if you find
A thousand more
Unanswered questions down inside
That's all you find

What if you pick apart the logic
And begin to poke the holes
What if the crown of thorns is no more
Than folklore that must be told and retold

But what if you're wrong
What if there's more
What if there's hope
You never dreamed of hoping for
What if you jump?
Just close your eyes
What if the arms that catch you
Catch you by surprise?
What if He's more than enough?
What if it's love?

Cause you've been running
As fast as you can
And you've been looking
For a place you can land
For so long but what if you're wrong

What if you jump?
Just close your eyes
What if the arms that catch you
Catch you by surprise?
What if He's more than enough?
What if it's love?
What if it's love?
