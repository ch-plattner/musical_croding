Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead
Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead (I'd Dig U)
Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead

A long time ago, U took six months a walkin'
Talkin' on the other side
What started as an experiment
Turned into a heaven-sent message that saved your ass from dyin'
Somebody said

"In life there's always peaks and valleys...
And if you're lost they won't show U the way"
That same somebody said "I'd dig U better dead
But I'd much rather see if your God is what U say, say, say"

And with the awesome power they struck
1st they offered up the buck
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)
A toke or 2, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)

One minute you're hot
Tell the truth and you're not
That's the noose that they hang on a goose like U

That same somebody said "I'd dig U better dead
But I'd much rather see if your God is what U say, say, say"

Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead
Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead
Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead
Dig U better dead, I'd dig U better dead

And whatever U do, don't make somebody happy
Don't dress 2 freaky and make their daughters stare
Then U'll find out how deep the valley truly be
If U plan on catchin' the bus, U better have plenty fare

I'd dig, dig U better dead
