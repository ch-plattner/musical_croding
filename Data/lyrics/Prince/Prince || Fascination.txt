Fascination
I want U
Fascination
I want U, I do
Fascination chamber lands on the round that kills
The art U hoped 2 mirror like
Leaves blood upon the sill
The dream U keep dreaming, is better than the life U lead
The papers run out a day and 13 hours, B4 the weed, it's so high

Fascination
Still I want U
Fascination
Still I want U, I do

The head U thought was rolling, is now reason 2 b bored
The rapper that gave that head will thank his manager b4 the lord
And the headache that U moan about feels much better than the treatment would
The pills gonna leave a side effect
That'll take another pill 2 correct
And the whole thing is leaving U feeling less than good
And U still high

...Nation
Fascination
Fascination
Fascination

Do U mind if I just watch U shake it
Shake it [4x]

...Nation
I want U
Fascination
I want U, I do

The most vital thing U thought
Is the epitome of doom
U can wake-up in cold sweat
Cause 1 of them is in U're room
Singin on the tele
Making more bucks than sense
So called king gives birth 2 so called ... prince

A breakup's bitter taste
Still here when the love is gone
And the breaks U wish 4
Finally comes among in song
Working it out
Work, work, work, working it out
Fascination
