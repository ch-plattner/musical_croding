
Open your heart, open your mind
A train is leaving all day
A wonderful trip through our time
And laughter is all U pay

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day

Now dig
Loneliness already knows U
There ain't no reason 2 stay
Come here and take my hand, I'll show U
I think I know a better way, y'all

Around the world in a day
(listen 2 me, babe)
Around the world in a day
(all the babies sing it now)

Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
No-sha-sha
No shouting
No shouting
No - no shouting

The little 1 will escort U
2 places within your mind
The former is red, white, and blue
The ladder is purple, come on and climb

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
Come on, sing
Around the world in a day
Say papa, I think I wanna dance

(summer she is sweet)

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
All the little babies, sing around the world
Around the world in a day

A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
A nation of alms, the production, sharing ideas, a shower of flowers
