
Get it on
Right on

A zero point approaches
And the field around you drop
Thoughts become reality
And it feels like time has stopped

When all that's on the radio
Is electromagnetic pop
Steady, your teeth are gnashin'

Compassion
Get it on
Compassion
Right on

Love for the greater number
Freezes over and cools
And everyone around you acts
Like a bloody fool

No sanctity to the left of you
No righteousness to the right
The only thing that's left in fashion

Compassion
Get it on
Compassion

Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
So much better than nothing

Everybody can win
With a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
Start up a brand new something

When ego, fear, and judgment
Become the rule of law
Watch the polar ice caps
Heat up, melt down, and thaw

When the greedy one forgets
That he's the reason for it all
The only gold that's so worth stashing

Compassion
Get it on, get it on
Compassion
Right on, right on

In the high-seated lawless no love can be found
Nature will rise against nature and get down

Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
It's so much better than nothing

Everybody can win
With a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
Start up a brand new something

If you got compassion
Let's get back in fashion
The new international anthem

Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
It's so much better than nothing

Everybody can win
With a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
And start up a brand new something

Whatever skin you're in
(Whatever skin you're in)
We all need to be friends
(Black and white and yellow, we can be friends)
All happy again
It's so much better than nothing

Everybody can win
With a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
And start up a brand new something
