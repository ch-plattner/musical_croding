
In a room full of harlots and fantasy
Destiny beckoned us there
Curious child on the balcony
We took the dare

Careless I was 2 caress thee
Yet never regretting the time
The joy that we shared, it was meant 2 be
And not a crime
No, it's not a crime

If memory serves us, we will align
2 the truth that we most often share
Curious child, U are on my mind
Do U care?
