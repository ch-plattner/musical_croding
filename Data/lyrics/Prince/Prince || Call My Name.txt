
Call, call my name 
Call it, call my name 

Eye heard Ur voice this morning calling gout my name 
It had been so long since Eye heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no 
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken b4 
B4 the day Eye carried U through the bridal path door 

And ever since that day Eye haven't wanted anyone but U 
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth 

[Chorus]
Eye just can't stop writing songs about U 
Eye love U so much 
Eye just can't wait 2 get my arms around U 
And feel Ur touch 
If eye don't c U real soon baby girl 
Eye might go insane 
Eye know it's only been about 3 hours 
But Eye love it when U call my name 

Eye heard a voice on the news saying people want 2 stop the war 
If they had a love as sweet as U they'd 4get what they were fighting 4 
What's the matter with the world 2day? 
The land of the free? Somebody lied 
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home 
They'll only c U and me making love inside 

[Chorus]

Eye've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night Eye saw it with U 
It let me know Eye'd never seen the moon b4 
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws 
But 2 compare it 2 a beauty like Urs would give 1 pause 
Nothing about U is false, that's why Ur love is real 
God 4bid if U belonged 2 another Eye'd have 2 steal U 
Eye'd have 2 take U from Ur man 
Eye might b tempted 2 break the law round here 
Because Ur beauty, it gives 1 pause 
It slows me down 

[Chorus]
