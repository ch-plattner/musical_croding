Ever since I was a little baby
I had 2 have double everything
When they tell me that's enough
That's when I wanna fill my cup
2 the top, Johnny, hear me sing

Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - see U in the purple rain
Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - break the chain, break the chain

Ever since that Eve did unto Adam, alright
What somebody been sho'nuff doin' 2 me (Watch it!)
I've been tryin' 2 break the chain
Get my little ass out the game
I'd rather sing with a bit more harmony, oh

Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - see U in the purple rain
Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - break the chain, break the chain

Johnny please, huh, when I was on my knees
My back was broken and my spirit ill at ease
And now it seems just like the autumn leaves
Your money's turned from green 2 brown and now U best believe

Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - see U in the purple rain
Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Emancipation - break the chain, break the chain

(Emancipation) [repeat in BG]
Break the chain, oh yeah
Well, sho'nuff
See U in the purple rain
Emancipation - free 2 do what I wanna
Break the.. break the.. break the chain!

Hey!
Alright!
Hey! [x4]

Emancipation
Free - don't think I ain't!

Emancipation
