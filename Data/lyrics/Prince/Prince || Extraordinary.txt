Extraordinary
The love U make 2 me it's some kind of scary
I would B a fool 2 leave U 4 I was born 2 love U
This is true

Extraordinary
The way U make me feel
I'm so very glad it's real
And not a dream
Even though it seems I am dreaming
People try 2 break us up
Valentines a little rough
But we survived 'cos we had a love

Extraordinary
I'd give the world 2 U
Each and every thing U do is so very nice
U make my clock tick 12 twice
Then disappear time and everything else
When U R near
