Maybe I'll want cha 2morrow
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
On the deep blue sea

Perhaps U noticed that I never look U in the eye
I'm just afraid that I might die of my love 4 U
I wanna kiss U, but baby, I dare not try
Or my dreams most surely will come true
So that's why...

Please don't hold my hand cuz I will
Damn sure understand and kill
The other boys in the band who want U 2morrow, 2morrow

They can't tap it - not 2morrow
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
U're mine 2morrow

On a deep blue sea I wanna be swept away
With U I could pass the time of every night and every day (All
time)
Never remembering the songs 2 sing, let alone what notes 2 play
I'm gonna die of my love 4 U, baby

Stay with me 2night, my dear
But please don't hold me tight cuz I fear
My heart just might feel joy instead of sorrow 2morrow

I don't wanna be happy - not 2morrow (not 2morrow)
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
I'd rather cry 2morrow

2morrow is the day I say after 2day
That U and I can play like we wanna
With under garments thrown, the seed can be sown
Slippery in the sauna (Oh)

If I could just look U in the eye
But baby, I dare not try
Cuz then my dreams will surely come true (All time)

Please don't hold my hand cuz I will
Damn sure understand and kill
The other boys in the band who want U 2morrow, 2morrow

2morrow
