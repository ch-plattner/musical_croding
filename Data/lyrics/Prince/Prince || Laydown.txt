You need to, you need to
You need to laydown
You need to, you need to
You need to laydown

You need to laydown
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town

From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now

You need to
You need to laydown
Come on

You need to
You need to laydown
I see ya

You need to shut it up
Your cup ain't full enough
Let me show you what I learned
From laying in the cut

You need a six string
And let that sucker ring
The holy funking roll
Let it get the people up

You need to laydown
You need to
You need to laydown

To say this name borders on blasphemy
Everybody wanna be me
If your girlfriend didn't have the surgery
Maybe she could see what I see

You need to, you need to
You need to laydown

You need to laydown
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town

From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now

Yours ain't really the grove we dance to
We need something more funky to move to
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
That purple bounce, bounce

Rio de Janeiro
Euro and [Incomprehensible]
This dirty little groove for you
Let's do it now, come on, boo

Bounce, bounce
Come on, now, come on, now
Bounce, bounce
Come on, now, come on, now

Bounce, bounce
Come on, now, come on, now
Bounce, bounce
Come on, now, come on, now

You need to laydown
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town

From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Let's go
