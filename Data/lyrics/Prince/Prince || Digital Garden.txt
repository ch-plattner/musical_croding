
Love, like a rose in bloom
All of the Rainbow Children will feel it soon
2 the east, word traveled about this energy
Until it reached the Banished Ones
Who just wanted this love 2 cease

They now fallen in2
The Resistor's dream
And they built a Digital Garden
Or so it seemed

In this brilliant darkness
So-called angels of light
"Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies"

And all the Rainbow Children
Will stand and fight
4 everlasting, everlasting life
4 the one who sits on the right
4 Him we're willing to do the work

The Banished Ones approaching the palace shouted obscenities. They tried 2
confuse the Rainbow Children and dethron their king. Using the lies promoted
by the whosepapers, hellavisions, and scagazines- The Banished Ones
constructed a Digital Garden around the palace that extended throughout the
world. Furthermore they demanded compensation 4 their time spent in the
palace b4 the exile. This was noise! "So be it," said the Wise One, and
gladly obliged with an INVISIBLE DEED. The Banished Ones accepted and
returned to their place of birth in MendaCity. As 4 the Rainbow Children,
they began deconstructing the Digital Garden. Door to door they went in
search of those willing to do The Work
