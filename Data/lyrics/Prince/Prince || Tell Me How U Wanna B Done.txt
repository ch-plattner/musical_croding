Tell me how U want 2 be done

Baby, how U wanna, how U wanna be done?
Just say the word and we can start from number 1
And go the distance, baby, until U tell me 2 stop
I'd lose myself inside U till U get all I got
Talk 2 me, baby (ooh), tell me how U wanna be done

(How U wanna be done?)

Shall I go in a circle like the merry-go-round
That U and your girlfriends used 2 ride all up and down?
Talk 2 me, baby, tell me how U want 2 be done (How U wanna be
done?)

Shall I write the alphabet? (A B C D E F G)
Or shall I just write my name?
U tell me, U're the ruler in this telephone game
I could be a slave when it comes down 2 U (Slave)
I'll do any and everything U want me 2 do
U know why? (Why?)
Cuz I want U 2 have fun
So how U wanna be done?
(Yeah, baby, yeah!) (How U wanna be done?)

Baby, how U wanna, how U wanna be done?
Just say the word and we could start from number 1
And go the distance, baby, till U tell me 2 stop
I'd lose myself inside U till U get all I got
Talk 2 me, baby (yeah), tell me how U wanna be done

(Yeah, yeah)

I want U 2 imagine U're making angels, angels in the snow
And kiss a hundred revolutions nice and slow
Then I see U on the beat do a def striptease
No, no, leave the Chanel around your neck - please, baby, please
Now do something I've never seen before (How U wanna be
done?)
Crawl over 2 me on your stomach - more, baby, more
Now pull me down on top of U and grind really fast
(Tell me how U wanna be done)
Take both hands with all your might and squeeze my... yeah!
Roll me over until U're back on top
Then I want U 2 kiss me until I make U stop
That's how, that's how I wanna be done (Tell me how U wanna be
done)

(How U wanna be done?)

Baby, how U wanna, how U wanna be done?
Just say the word and we can start from number 1
And go the distance, baby, until U tell me 2 stop
I'd lose myself inside U till U get all I got
Talk 2 me, baby (ooh), tell me how U wanna be done

Baby, baby

Baby, how U wanna, how U wanna be done?
Just say the word and we can start from number 1
And go the distance, baby, till U tell me 2 stop
