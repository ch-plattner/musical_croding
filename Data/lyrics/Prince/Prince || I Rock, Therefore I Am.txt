I rock (I rock) therefore I am (therefore I am)
Right or wrong I sing my song the best I can

I don't want suggestions about my hair
If the whole world buys your bullshit I don't care
I'd rather put on something that you won't dare

All you mean to NPG to the maximum want you to understand somethin'-asta
[Come/When] me say [no/love] me say unto another
Watcha them attack each and every vulture
Or do you wants forget that P-R-O starts via pro
Teachin' things in life you'll never know
What for they dabble they don't understandsa
They caught me comin' from the other Minnesota
My flava will burn their earsa
Awhen it comes to music this sir is no stranger

Is the same kids you compliment
The same ones that you were meant
To rob an education from
In a private school as opposed to one
That yearly spits out another group of fools
Into a system designed to fail
Wait a minute, I just got some e-mail
Somebody selling 12 CDs for a dollar
Make me wanna holler (Yeah)
Alright to the maximum

I don't need you to tell me what clothes to wear
I don't want suggestions about my hair

(Rock) Make some noise if you're ready
NPG rocks the city
Rugged and raw lift up your bra
Show me your titties
Don't be a dumb son
Grab your condoms and Bacardi
Here's car keys, let's party
You fake players walkin' streets in mean mug
I be makin' records gettin' (mmmh) in the hot tub
(Rock) In this Minneapolis snow I'm fellin'
Ready set to blow up like Mt. Saint Helen
On your cord snorin' your flow borin'
Sort of like channel 5 at 4 in the mornin'
(Rock) Adult [made under / [...] on the par] give up hope
Grab the devil by the throat
Make him play the scapegoat
(Rock) In the runnin' with the bucket of cuttin's
Wishin' I had duckets to live like Kirby Puckett
(Rock) Here comes the rumors I'm down with NPG
I sign the contract, I'm doing the LP
But woe, what a minute bro' go slow
Ten dollars for the blow, no dollars for the ho'
(Rock) In the club trick holdin'
Lookin' for a black magic [woman gang] strong [with/is] dick holdin'

I rock therefore I am (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
