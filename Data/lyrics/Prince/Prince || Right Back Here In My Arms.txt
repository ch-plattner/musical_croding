Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms) [x2]
Right back here, yeah

Don't want U 2 write me no letters
Don't want U callin' my farm
I just want U, I just want U
I just want U right back here in my arms
Alright

I ain't checkin' 4 the sweet talk, baby (Right)
Talkin' 'bout how U're missin' my charms (Right)
I just want U, I just want U
I just want U right back here in my arms ("That's my only mission")
I just want U, I just want U
I just want U right back here in my arms

(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby

I know U got a lot on your mind (Right)
That's why I wanna give U some time (Right)
Till I get 2, till I get 2
Till I get 2 hug that body so fine

I know U need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showin' my face (Right)
I just want U, I just want U
I just want U right back here in my arms

Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms)
(Right, right)
Right back in my arms (Right back here in my arms)
Right back, right back
Right back here in my arms
(Right) (Right back here in my arms)

No, no, no 2 the postman bringin' me letters
U know a brotha gonna feel much better
If he keep his mind on, U know, whatever
Anything as long as it is makin' it wetter
Cuz I can't stop thinkin' about what we do
There ought 2 be a law against the hoochie ooh! (Ooh!)
Can we groove? I don't wanna do U no harm
I just want U right back here in my arms

Oh baby (Right back here in my arms)

Don't want U 2 write me no letters
I just want U, I just want U
I just want U right back here in my arms

Ooh yeah, right back here in my arms
(Right back here in my arms)
I just want U right back here in my arms (Right)
Right back here in my arms
(Right back here in my arms) (Right)
Right back, right back (Right)
I'll try 2 write U back
(Right back here in my arms)
