
You ready?
Naw... you ain't ready (naw, you ain't ready)
I mean ready for us

(You know you want me like a new pair of shoes)

This could be us
But you be playin'
This could be us
But you keep on fooling around

You're the cage to my dove
I'm just saying
Forever and ever in love
Oh baby yea
This could be us

(You know you want me like a new pair of shoes)

This could be us
This could be us

You, you say you ain't ready
Ready to go steady, you ain't ready for us (no)
Cause what I got make you weak in the knees
Take your energy (oh baby), make you sleep for a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it, metaphysically

(This could be us)
This could be us
(This could be us)
This could be us

I, I know you're lovin your freedom
Cause your freedom, is paying your bills (on funky dolla holla)
(Yes it is)
Boyfriends, you think you don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think you will (show you right)

This could be us yes
But you be playin' (oh yeah...)
This could be us (you sho' nuff could be)
But you keep on fooling around

We, we come upon a crossroad
And we got to decide (decide), which way to turn
(Which way, "yes" which way to turn)
Are we gonna go (Are we gonna go)
Go (Are we gonna)
Over the bridge (Over the bridge)
Over the bridge (Over the bridge)
Before, before it burns
(Don't you let it burn) let it burn, baby

(This could be us)
This could be us
(oh yea)
This could be us
(Oh you gotta stop playin baby)

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That a woman needs love (L-O-V-E, love)
Like a river flow, like a river flow
(Inside) If it's good, that's all she thinkin' of

Metaphysical cookie makin' creme
Sleep alone if you wanna
Nothing mystical let me lick it pretty clean
(Like a new pair of shoes)
After that, (You can put me on my back)
(You gonna want to show me off to the world)
You can put me in the back with the candy in
My purple psychedelic pimp sac
When I, Ooohhhhh

This right here
This could be us
This could be us

This could be us (oh yeah)
But you be playin' (yes you do now)
This could be us (honey, honey, honey)
But you keep on fooling around

You're the cage to my dove
I'm just saying (I'm just saying)
Forever and ever in love
Oh baby yea
This could be us

(This could be us)
This could be us
(This could be us)
This could be us

This could be us

This could be us

You're the cage to my dove
Only one I been dreaming of
Forever and ever in love
Ohh baby, yea
This could be
This could be
This could be us,
But you don't have time for
Me... no... more
The happy & the free
