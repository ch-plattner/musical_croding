
Close the shop, let's take a drive
Take a break from 9 to 5
It's so great to be alive, oh yeah
We could rent some roller skates
We could skate around the lake
If we don't know how, we'll fake it, oh yeah

Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin', oh yeah

Let's forget about the time (time)
Let's relax and ease our mind (mind)
We deserve to just feel fine, oh yeah
We could stroll the mezzanine (stroll)
Buy some dirty magazine
Laugh behind it while we're eatin' ice cream (ha ha ha ha)

Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin' oh yeah

See the man with the blue guitar
Maybe one day he'll be a star
Give him your ice cream and
I'll give him the keys to my car
There's so much hate goin' round
Hard to not let it get you down
Least we can do is make a joyful sound, oh yeah

Strollin', strollin', we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin', oh yeah

Strollin', strollin'
Rockin', rollin' (we could have fun, we could have fun)
Oh yeah (just strollin')

Close the shop, let's take a ride (strollin', strollin')
Take a break from 9 to 5 (we could have fun just strollin')
It's so great, so great to be alive (Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')
(we could have fun just strollin')
Rockin', Rollin' (Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')
(we could have fun just strollin')
(Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')
(we could have fun just strollin')
Oh yeah
