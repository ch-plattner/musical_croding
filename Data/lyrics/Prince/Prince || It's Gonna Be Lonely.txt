
We've been together for quite some time
I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
And I'd be so lonely

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
'til I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
It gets me every time
I betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are

Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
Giving me everything that I need
Oh pretty baby, can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely
Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I never could resist
Oh, baby don't go!

We've been together for quite some time
It'd take forever to get you off my mind
Oh, girl!

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you by my side
Don't you know that I could die, baby

Without you loving me
Can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

It's gonna be lonely, baby
So lonely, baby
