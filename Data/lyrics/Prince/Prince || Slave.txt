Everybody except 4 me
I just want a chance 2 play the part
The part of someone truly free

Like candle slowly burning, I can feel my world unravel
Hemisphere upon hemisphere lie beneath my soul, soul
My enemies kept it turning, but now they pound the gavel
And judging me accordingly, I know, I know

Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart
Everybody except 4 me
I just want a chance 2 play the part
The part of someone truly free

Hey! [x3]
Oh

Burning slowly candle, handle careless they did
Merrily down 3 heartbreak boulevards
Like fashion statements, they lie "U be lookin' so good 2night, kid"
I do my best 2 party, it's just that everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart

Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart
Everybody except 4 me
I just want a chance 2 play the part
The part of someone truly free

Except 4 me (Except 4 me)
I just want a chance 2 play

(Just wanna be free)

Slowly candle burns, where'd they learn hypnosis?
How'd they keep me under 4 so long?
Break the bread I earn, just keep me far from closest
I need their kind 2 illustrate what's wrong - what's wrong?

Well, I'll tell U they just keep tryin' 2 break my heart
They just keep tryin' 2 break my heart, ow!

(Everybody) [x2]

Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart
Everybody except 4 me
I just want a chance 2 play the part
The part of someone truly free

But I can't let U break my heart

(Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart)
Slave! (Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart)
Slave! Slave! (Everybody keeps tryin' 2 break my heart)
Slave!
