(Style) Style, uh!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Style, dig it
(Style) Style, come on
Uh, style
Style is not something that comes in a bottle
Style is more like Jackie O. when she was doin' Aristotle
Style is not a logo that sticks 2 the roof of one's ass
Style is like a second cousin 2 class

U got it! - Style, come on
U got it! - Style, say what?
U got it! - Style, come on
U got it! - Style, check it

Style ain't sittin' court side with the owner of the team
Style is owning the court and charging 'em all a fee
Style is not lusting after someone because they're cool
Style is loving yourself 'til everyone else does 2

U got it! - Style, come on
U got it! - Style, maybe
U got it! - Style, well well
U got it! - Style

Bridge:
Style don't get drunk on a Saturday night
Try 2 dress up every Sunday mornin' bright
Style don't get married then break the vow in a year
Style is keepin' a promise
Raise your hand y'all if U hear me

(Style) [x2]

Style is not biting style when U can't find the funk
Style is the face U make on a Michael Jordon dunk
Style ain't the jeep U bought when U know your broke ass got bills
Style is lettin' your lover drive while U talk on the phone and chill

U got it! - Style
U got it! - Style, maybe
U got it! - Style, come on
U got it! - Style

Bridge:
Style is a gold-tooth smile with an attitude
Style is a peaceful wild postin' the rude
Style is growing your own food
Style is a non-violent march
Style is an accurate account of what's inside every heart (Style)

Style is not a lie
Style is a man that cries
Style is the glow in a pregnant woman's eyes

(Style) [x4]

U got it! - Style, come on
U got it! - Style, do that, do that
U got it! - Style, got it?
U got it! - Style, mad, come on

(Style) U got it! - Yeah
(Style) U got it!
Style is a peaceful wild y'all
(Style) U got it! - Style
(Style) U got it!
Style is not thinking about style
So let me stop (Style)

(Style) [repeats in BG]
It's nice man
What U call that?
Style, I like that
It's about me?
(Keep, keep, keepin' on, people gotta keep, keep, keepin' on)
Right on (U got it!)
I ain't got no job, but I got style
Style, yeah

(Style) U got it!
Oh yeah
Hang on, hang on...

Style is buying your moms a house
Style is a clean mouth
Style is puppy breath
Style is no fear of death
Style is Ali's jab
Style is hailing a cab (Style)
Then U know, givin' 'em the finger when they pass your ass!

(Style) (U got it!) Bonnie, Bonnie
(Style) (U got it!) Oh yeah
(Style) Shirley, shake your ass, Shirley
(Sytle) Shirley, Shirley, I love U, Shirley

(Style) (U got it!) [repeat in BG)
Style is Mayte in the shower
Style is a soul new power
Style is when all black men are free
Style is U and me

(U got it!) [x3]
