
Another Friday night
Another tired line

Baby, U sure look good,
Hey baby, what's your sign?
How many ask 4 your number
Before they even know your name?
How many out there tired of playing
This silly o-old time game?

Hey, and when the lights go down
And it's justa U 2
It's when U and your lover, yeah
Do what [... wanna] do

That's when U feel the heat
Hotter than July
That's when U and your baby, baby, baby
When your baby get a ride
Yeah, when your baby get a ride

How can U tell him no
When he loves U so?
Buy U anything
Anything U want
His eyes all aglow
He'll know U're good 2 go
Duh-dun
Duh-dun
Duh-dun
In front of a restaurant, yeah

Girl, U'd better know
Really, until U do it couple o' times in a row
It's just the same
It's just a game
Go back to do whatever, sleep outside your door

When the lights go down, yeah
And it's just U 2
That's when U hear the sounds
Of what true lovers do, yeah
And when U feel the heat, yo
Hotter than July
That's when U and your baby
When your baby get a ride
Yeah, hey, and when your baby get a ride now

Then when your baby get a ride

That's when your baby get a ride
That's when your baby play with U tonight
