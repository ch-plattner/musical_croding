(Come with it)

The main problem with war
Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how 2 do it all over again.

No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution?

The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say (They say)
1 minute they want peace (Want peace)
Then do everything 2 make it go away

Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now people how is that resolution?

[Chorus:]
Either U do or U don't
Either U will or U won't
Making amends (Make amends)
Is a difficult pill 2 swallow

What can we lose if we try ?
With no water, a flower dies
With no1 2 lead resolution will follow

(Ohh, Yes it will)

Resolution

Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If U love it like Ur best friend

Handle Ur heart with care
It's as delicate as a wing
When the storms come again
Pray for resolution

Either U will or U won't (Either U will or U won't)
Either U do or U don't

Will U want resolution ? (Either U do or U don't)
Come On eveybody
All over the world (La,la,la,la,la)
All over the world (Do, do, do, do, do)
Tell me
How many people really want resolution?
