Let me see ya dance

New coat, huh?
That's nice
Did u buy it?
Yeah, right
U seeing that rich motherfucker again
U know who I'm talking about
That slicked back paddy with all the gold in his mouth
Don't try to play me 4 yesterday's fool
Cuz I'll slap your ass into the middle of next week
I'm sorry baby, that's the rules

I pay the rent in this raggedy motherfucker
And all u do is suck up food and heat
Say what? Oh yeah?
4 someone who can't stand them T.V. dinners
U sure eat enought of them motherfuckers
Who bought u that diamond ring?
Yeah, right.
Since when did u have a job?
U seeing that rich motherfucker again
What's his name? Bob?
Bob, ain't that a bitch?
What's he do for a living?
Manage rock stars?
Who?
Prince?
Ain't that a bitch?
That skinny motherfucker with the high voice?
Please, who do I look like baby?
Yesterday's fool?
Don't u know I will kill u now?
U're fuckin' right.

U think I don't?
Then what's this?
Oh, u quiet now

And go in there
And put on that wig I bought U

Ain't that a bitch?

(Come out with your hands up)
I'll kick your ass (This is your last warning)
Think I won't? (Oh no! The nigger's got a laser)
(Let's get the hell out of here)

Is Mr. George home?
Hello, Mr. George? [Note: The high pitched voice]
This is your conscience, motherfucker [that responds to his call, when]
Why don't u leave motherfuckers alone? [slowed down to about 2 rpm,says]
What's wrong with u? ["Operator, what city please?"]
Well, why can't we just dance?
Why can't we just dance?
No, fuck that, fuck that
I don't talk about u, I don't talk about u
Wit' yo' little almond-shaped head ass
Who the fuck do u think this is?
I'll kick your ass... twice

Bob, if u're out there
Let me see u dance
U said u were funky, c'mon

B-O-B, spell the shit backwards, what'd it say
Same motherfuckin' shit

Turn it out
