Why are you so arrogant?
(Th....Th...There he is!)
(Th....There he is!)
(Th....Th...There he is!)

What makes a man wanna rule the world? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Make him man enough to say he's 50-50 girl (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
What makes a man wanna curse and swear? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Then blame it on heaven cuz he's already there
Pimprag, tootsie pop, and a cane

What makes a man wanna play guitar? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Same thing that makes him wanna be a star (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
What makes him wanna see his name in lights? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
...it was the same thing that made Eve take the 1st bite
Pimprag, tootsie pop, and a cane

(Don't make me get up) (There he is, get him) (Don't make me get up)
Like a flame she came and I was no longer cold
That's a little shady, for this lady was only 16 years old.
