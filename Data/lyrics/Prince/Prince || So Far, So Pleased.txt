
So far, so pleased
I like the way U touch me
I like the way U tease
No car, no keys
I had 2 get us stranded
If U know what I mean
Big scar on my knee
Begging 4 a kiss is such a dull routine
Still I'm...
So far, so far, so far, so pleased

So far, so fine
I find another beauty mark
With every glass of red wine
So fast the time
Everytime I have to go, I go and lose my mind
It's hard, okay
That's what happens
When a boy and girl don't get 2 play
So far, so far, so far, so pleased

(Yeah)
(Come on, come on)

So far, so pleased
I like the way U touch me
I like the way U tease
No car, no keys
I could spend the night and leave at 10:15
So far, so far, so far, so pleased

Ooh-ooh yeah
So far, so pleased
Oh-ooh
