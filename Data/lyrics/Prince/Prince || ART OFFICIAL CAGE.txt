Cage
Cage
Åbn dette bur!
[Translation: "Open this cage!"]
Come on, let's go
Free the people, come on, let's go
Free the people
Free the people

I woke up in the city in a bit of a rage
Determined 2 free my mind from this art official cage
Tought by tought my teachers taught from an early age
A place in heaven far off in the future

Come on, let's go
Free the people, come on, let's go
Art official, art official cage

Ghettos 2 the left of me, malls 2 the right
Why's my kingdom come only in prayers at night?
What should I expect if I'm not willing 2 fight?
A place in heaven somewhere in the future

Art official, art official
Art official cage

Louder than a bomb since the day of my birth
Got me 2nd class when I got here 1st
Lovely score but how am I supposed 2 know what it's worth
Art official age in the future

Free the people, come on, let's go
Startin' from the top, gettin' higher so
Never goin' back underwater, no
Brand new boogie without the hero
As sure Minneapolis get this snow
I'm goin' up Lady Liberty's dress and blow, blow, blow

Art official, free the people
Art official, art official cage
Cage
Cage
Art official cage
Cage
We need U 2 tell us what U know
Cage
We need U 2 tell us what U know
Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage
Cage, cage, cage, age, age, age
