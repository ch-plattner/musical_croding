We don't give a damn
We just wanna jam
Party up

That army bag
Such a double drag
Party up

Party, got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Goin' uptown, baby
How you gonna make me kill somebody
I don't even know?

They got the draft, uh uh
I just laugh
Party up

Fightin' war
Is such a fuckin' bore
Party up

Party, uh uh, got to party down, babe
Ooh, it's all about what's in your mind
Goin' uptown, baby
I don't wanna die
I just wanna have a bloody good time

Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up

Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream, no cake
All lies, no truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?

Party up
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe, ooh
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe, ooh

Got to party up, yeah, ooh ooh
Got to party up, babe, ooh
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
'Cause we don't wanna fight no more

You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
'Cause we don't wanna fight no more

You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
'Cause we don't wanna fight no more

I said, "We don't wanna fight no more"
'Cause we don't wanna fight no more
