
I see your picture wherever I go
I'm not here to lecture, just letting you know
I know you're busy, the world's calling you
If you don't answer what will you do?

You wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Will you settle for a prince
And a sea of everything?

I read your letter, every word
No one writes better, at least none that I've heard
You sound so happy or is this a charade?
Will you still feel the same when the spotlight fades?

Will you wander the wilderness
Searching for a king?
Will you settle for a prince
And a sea of everything?

You and me are like two ships passing
Never reaching shore
If we ever, ooh, if we ever did
We'd just want more

No reason to care what people say
For the keys are so far, so far, so far away
No need to say, no need
To say I'd die without you, without you
Because I made, I made, what will you do?

Will you wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Or will you settle for this
And a sea of everything?

Will you wander the wilderness
Searching, searching for a king
Or will you settle for this
And a sea of everything?

I see your picture wherever I go
I'm not here to lecture, just letting you know
I know you're busy, the world's calling you
