When the things U know are right
are far from what they seem
When the past becomes the future
and time becomes a dream
When the light of God
is the only thing in life that will redeem
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn
When the voices U hear commands U
2 entertain thee absurd
When U do the action unlocks
thee apocalypse of that you've heard of
When the day lies before U
seems the dakness in a word
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn

Every pieces a puzzle and every name a clue
Every charge U make is karma
So be careful what U do
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn

(Welcome 2 the dawn) (Thank U)
