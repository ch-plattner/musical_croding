If your body needs water
Keep on dancing cuz u oughta
Keep the blood flowing down 2 your feet
Brother Lois should be around in a minute
With a bucket filled with squirreled meat

The blood is real good if u drink it real fast
But the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
If u kiss somebody, u wanna party all night
All right!

If u do 2 much, your skin will be sensitive 2 touch
The first person that touches u, u want 2 fuck
U take them 2 your crib and u tie them 2 a chair
Then u make funny faces til they get really scared
Then u turn on the neon, then u play with yourself
Til u turn them on

This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
Cuz I'm stripped down, It's all fun and games
Til the very next day, til, damn, u don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see u next Thursday night, maybe I won't
But that's alright, cuz in my possession, there's a signed confession
that says, I was the best u ever had

2 bad

This beat is on time, refined design
