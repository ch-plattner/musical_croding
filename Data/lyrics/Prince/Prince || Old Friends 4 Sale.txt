
The sun set in my heart this evenin'
Cuz an old friend of mine got lost in the jive
Little did she know, when U're stuck in the snow
Nobody gets out alive

Tears fall gently in my garden
As I wait in vain 4 my sweet baby 2 call
I guess what my own brother told me was true
He had been with my sweet baby and she never really loved me at all

Night fell so dark this evenin'
The moon wasn't shinin' nowhere
Sometimes that old light in the alley would light up this old heart of mine
But now I'm wonderin' if there's someone up there who really cares

The night fell darkest in Persia
What used 2 flow blue is now flowin' black
Many a doctor can try, but only heaven knows why
When it comes 2 love
Why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?

Can't somebody please tell me?

Maybe the morning air will make me feel better
Oh, I hope better than I feel right now
Last night a stranger took my picture and then he, uh..
He asked if I'd buy it, huh
I said I guess I don't know how

Old, old friends 4 sale
Get'em while the gettin' is hot
But U better watch out, they'll kiss U until they get what U got
And they'll show U the friends that they're not
Old friends 4 sale
