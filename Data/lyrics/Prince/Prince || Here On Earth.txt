
Imagine a young woman running 4 her very life
Tryin' 2 get away from the one who loves her
This young woman ur wife
In2 an alley cold and rainy
October just b4 dawn...
Leaping atop a mountain of bricks
Her clothes now covered with sick,
The danger hardly gone
She turns and curses the day she met u
And that she wishes she was never born...
Say it's just a dream...
U open up ur eyes and come 2 realize
U simply imagined this
So u lean over and give her a kiss
Here on earth, here on earth,
With u it's not so bad
Here on earth, here on earth
Eye don't feel so sad
Stay right here
Here on earth
