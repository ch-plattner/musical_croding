
All my friends tell me
About the loves they've had
Can't they see what they're doing to me?
It makes me feel so bad
'Cause I'm so alone
And brokenhearted
It ain't like my life is ended
But more like it never started
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating
I try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away
Still waiting
I'm waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
Waiting for the love to come around
Oh, love.
Waiting for the love to come around

People say that I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
But they don't know, they really don't know
That's all that I've been dreaming of
'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying
And I spend my days just a-trying
To find that love to call my own
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone

Still waiting
Waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love to come around.
(Waiting for the love) Don't you know that I'm waiting
(Waiting for the love) Say..
(Waiting for the love) To come around now

I need somebody to hold on to baby
Waiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm

Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love, sugar
Still waiting
If you're out there girl, please come to me
Still waiting
Don't make me cry no more
Still waiting
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
Still waiting
Wishing and wishing for days, baby
Still waiting
If you're out there, girl, please come to me
Still waiting
