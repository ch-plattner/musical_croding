
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' U

The music rocked us
Our eyes locked-thus
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

U whispered something
It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jackin' all over the place

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
2 commit the crimes of passion
That sets us free
Me lovin' U, U lovin' me (me lovin' u, u lovin' me)

The electric chair

I saw your friend 1st
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' u (I was watchin' u)
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo
I've got to have it
Somebody...

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

U know I'm guilty, yeah, (4 all my future crimes)
Guilty, (4 all my future crimes)
And if ya don't really love me
(Then give me the electric chair) oh!

Electric chair
