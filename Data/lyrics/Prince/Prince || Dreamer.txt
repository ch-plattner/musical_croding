
Eye was born & raised on the same plantation 
In the united states of the red, white and blue 
Eye never knew that eye was different 
Til dr. king was on the balcony 
Lying in a bloody pool 
Expected so much more from a loving society 

A truthful xplanation but you know what? 
Eye got another conspiracy 

If it was just a dream... call me 
Call me a dreamer 2 
With more rewards & accolades 
Than anyone b4 or after 
21st century, oh what a shame 
That race still matters 
A race 2 what and where we going? 
We r in the same boat 
But eye'm the only one rowin 
Last time eye checked you were sleepin' 
...but you can call me a dreamer 2 
Peanut butter logic served on a bed of lies 
Don't go down 2 easy 
When you see ur father cryin' 
Have you ever clutched the steering wheel 
Of ur car 2 tight? 

Prayin' that the police sirens 
Pass you by at night? 
While the helicopter circles 
& the theory's getting deep 
Thing they're spraying chemicals over the city 
While we sleep? 

From now on eye'm staying awake...
So you can call me a dreamer 2 
Wake up wake up
