
I don't like this much 2 drink
I was there
I know right now it's hard 2 think
I don't care
But it's time 4 U and me 2 wonder
Why we're here
Maybe we should roll 2 the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square (Let's roll)

Meet me there
If U dare
Calhoun Square!

It don't matter clothes U're wearin'
Or your hair
If U're freaky, they don't care and
They don't stare (Ain't nobody lookin' at U)
All that matters if U're happy
And if U're there (Are U there?)
Don't U wanna roll 2 the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square? (Don't U wanna? Come on now)

Hey!

Meet me there
If U dare
Calhoun Square!

Walk through veils of many colors
If U dare (Do U dare?)
Jasmine, peach and love 4 others
In the air (It's all in the air)
Don't be shocked 2 see your mother
In the chair (Sit down, baby)
Everybody roll 2 the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square (Oh Lord)

Hey, come on!
Oh Lord [x2]
Here me now

Calhoun Square, Calhoun Square [x2]

Meet me there
If U dare
Calhoun Square!
