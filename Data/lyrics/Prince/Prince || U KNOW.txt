No, like this

Surprise, surprise
Another treat, another trick
Huh, this is sweet
Which one's which?

4 the record, let me state that I never had a reason 2 break contractual endeavor or sever relationship with anyone I pleasure, pleasure

4 the playa, let me stop and say that I only paid attention when I heard U mention that he tried 2 take Ur treasure, treasure 
(Oh, no he didn't?)

(What then?)
And as a matter of fact I would have gave U back, but then he had a heart attack when U made him pack and said his shack without U would be better, better 
(See, what I really mean... uh)
See, what I really mean is that our future queen should never be in frustration with this rock 'n' roll machine ... no, no ... not ever, ever 
(Yeah, hmm... U know)
(What?)

U know how much I want U
U know how much I care
When he gone, U know I'm gonna flaunt U
U know, U know (U know)
U know how much I want U
U know how much I care
When he gone, U know I'm gonna flaunt U
U know, U know

If U really wanna find the answer 2 this cancer, then we must rewind

Then nevermind the 1st opinion, opinion 
(U better ask somebody else)

2 run this game requires fame, Ur soul and name and nothing gained unless it's sacrificed, my dear ... his only claim 4 his dominion, dominion

And any question of the deal is met with another demand 2 kneel and reprimand concealed allegations of U sinning, sinning 
(Huh... what's that all about?)
That's why, uh...
Feminine wiles R not surprised in recognizing that the power of the breasts is just a test that U'll be winning, winning 
(U got this)
Oh, baby!
(Will U feed me, baby?)
(Come on)
U know how much I want U
U know how much I care
When he gone, U know I'm gonna flaunt U
U know, U know
U know how much I want U
U know how much I care
When he gone, U know I'm gonna flaunt U
U know, U know

(There it is)
(Put Ur head down)
(Just thyself)
(Talk 2 me)
(Bye)

U know how much I want U
U know how much I care
When he gone, U know I'm gonna flaunt U
U know, U know
(Get it)
