
I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable. I guess I gave u all of my time
And now u plead insanity and u don't even know the score
Why can't u learn 2 play the game?
Baby, don't u know that u need more? (More, more, more)

U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
that can do the duty in your bed, yeah

We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
U try 2 fight it (try 2 fight it)
U say you've had enough (say u've had enough)
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
u want another someone (u want another someone)
Yo happily ever after be (Sure as there's a sun)
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm gonna be the 1)
I'm gonna be the 1 and if (u don't understand)
u don't understand face to face, (face to face)
Baby I'll tell u down on my knee, yeah

U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
that can do the duty in your bed
Solo, solo...

(sing it)

Oh Lord

U need another lover
U know there ain't no other
U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head
Hole in yo head. Hole in yo head
U need another lover like u need a hole, a hole, a hole, a hole
U need another lover
U know there ain't no other

There's gonna be a riot, if u don't clap your hands,
if u don't make that funky stand. Everybody.
U know there ain't no other
