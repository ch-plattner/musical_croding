Baby, U've got 2 rescue me girl, girl
A prisoner in love with the opposite gender

I ain't sayin' U're better, baby, but I ain't sayin' U're not
I ain't sayin' anything until U stop
Never forget that cuz baby, I'll be your jack of all trades
A mind and body well made

Crucial - baby, our love has got 2 be
Crucial - everything from A 2 Z
Crucial - U've got 2 show me everything, everything, everything

Is that Old Man River knockin' at your door
Sayin' that we got 2 let more than our feelings show?
Baby, 2night don't hold nothin' back, I know U've got some more
I'll give U mine if U give me yours

I ain't sayin' U're better, baby, I ain't sayin' U're not
I ain't sayin' anything until U stop
Baby, don't hold me back cuz baby, I.. baby I need a jack 4 all trades
A mind and body well made

Crucial - our love has got 2 be
Crucial - every little thing from A 2 Z
Crucial - U've got 2 show me everything, everything, everything
