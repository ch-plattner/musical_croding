Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinkin'
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least 4 2night
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Oh baby (Shy)

After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm goin' back 2morrow 2 make sure he's dead
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but U can call me ... "

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy

Shy - Lips say no but the body say might
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

The girl was rough, but he called her bluff
And he told her not 2 know was better
Fact or fiction he wondered
And that's when the rain and thunder got wetter
And at the top of the page he wrote ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

(Oh, say it now, yeah)
(Shy, shy!)
(Shy)

Ooh baby, don't U wanna be alone 2night?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night
