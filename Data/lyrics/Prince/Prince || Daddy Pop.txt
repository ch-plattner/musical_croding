
Oh Daddy
Oooh, sock it to me

See my brother talkin' plently head
Steady wishin' he could sleep in your bed
Steady wishin' he was in your car
Just a steady wishin' that he was who you are

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talkin' while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)

See all the people wonder why
You set your goals high - high as the sky
See the people runnin' from the truth
Livin' in the past
When they need to be livin' the new

Pop Daddy (oh yeah) - Daddy Pop
Brother steady talkin' while
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock

Pop - Daddy Pop
Pop - Punchin' in the rock and roll clock
Talk, guitar, talk

(oh daddy)

Daddy Pop is the writer and love is the book
U better look it over before you overlook

One - Oh Daddy
Two - Oh yeah
Three - Ooo, sock it to me
Four - Oh (come on), your the best

See all my critics wastin' time
Worryin' about the Daddy while he beat you blind
Get your life together - stop your cryin'
Whenever you say that you can't -
That's when you need to be tryin'

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (oh daddy)
Brother steady talkin' while (steady, steady, steady)
The girlies steady hop
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (punchin' in... punchin' in)

What kind of fool is this, that thinks Daddy will miss
What kind of boy would dis, a list, as long as his-tory itself
I got grooves and grooves up on the shelf (oh daddy)
Deep purple concord jams (oh yeah)
This party I will slam (I don't think)
I don't think you understand (sock it to me)
Whatever you can't do - Daddy can
The one and only Daddy Pop
(oh Daddy) One and only - Daddy Pop

Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (Oh no, my brother)
Brother steady talkin' while
The girlies steady hop (there ain't no stoppin')
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (Check the record, yeah!)
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock

Poppa Daddy's commin'
(Ring di di ding) comebody's calling
"The jester's on the phone!"
Oh yeah?
Rosie tell him I ain't home
He just one in a long line that wanna see me!

Daddy Pop

(Oh Daddy)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh Daddy)
(Oh yeah)

Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)
Daddy Pop (oh yeah)
Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)

As I step to the mic and lend a hand (oh daddy)
To the funky groove, let's make the whole house move
Yo band let me hear you say ooooo ((ooooo)) (oh yeah)
That's right, we're gonna turn this mother out tonight
We ain't leavin' 'til they (oh daddy)
Gonna have to turn off the lights
And if they do then what we gonna do?
((Trash it up cause we ain't through)) (oh yeah)
Yeah hit it, it's time to get with it, huh
I ain't no angel so 2 hell with playin' innocent (oh daddy)
Those who came to party know just what I'm talkin about
So come on y'all (oh yeah)
Wave your hand in the air, everybody
Wave your hand in the air (oh daddy)
For the funkiest band in the land and don't forget
The P-A-R-T-Y-M-A-N (oh yeah)

Peace (Daddy Pop) (oh daddy)
