Can a boy who drops out at school
At 13 years of age
Answer the 2 of life and death
When it slaps him in the face?
Who's 2 blame when he's got no place 2 go
And all he's got is the sense 2 know
That a life of crime'll help him beat U in the race
Help him beat U in the race (Help him beat U in the race)

Wave your hands 4 positivity y'all!
All the boys and all the girls (All the boys and all the girls)
U R the new kings of the world!
Shall the court sing together

"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
A whirlwind designed 2 slow U down
It cuts like a knife and tries 2 get in U
This Spooky Electric sound
Give up if U want 2 and all is lost
Spooky Electric will be your boss"

Call People magazine, Rolling Stone
Call your next of kin, cuz your ass is gone
He's got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side
Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, U better say died
Or U can fly high right by Spooky and all that he crawls 4
Spooky and all that he crawls 4

Don't kiss the beast
We need love & honesty, peace & harmony
Positivity
Love & honesty, peace & harmony
I said, hold on 2 your soul, U got a long way 2 go

Sho' nuff, sho' nuff, sho' nuff

Don't kiss the beast
Be superior at least

Hold on 2 your soul, y'all, court, sing
Hold on 2 your soul, we got a long way 2 go
Hold on 2 your soul
