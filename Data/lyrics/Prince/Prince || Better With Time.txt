
This might seem strange 
Since so much time has passed 
And since only one of us 
Still looks the same 
Ur words not mine, baby 
Ur still fine yes you r 
Like wine, you get better with time 
So young and so naive 
That eye never once believed 
That the memory of you would go thru 
Like wind goes thru the trees 

Maybe if you believe baby 
That eye would no deceive you 
U and eye side by side or somewhere 
In between 

Eye don't know if this is a bore 
But eye just can no longer ignore 
This fact so sublime 
U get better with time 

Anyone who's met you agrees 
That no one 4gets you most of all not me 
U can claim u're humble and hide 
But when it's true my dear 
It's not pride 

A jury of my peers would find me 
Guilty of so many crimes 
If eye chose not 2 remind you 
That you get better with time 

This might seem absurd 
2 someone so cultured 
And 2 one who would grace any stage 

When the hair that frames that face 
Dark brown or silvery lace 
What is age but a cage? never mind 
U'll b blind 2 not know that you get better with time
