(we r the new power generation)
Leave my tree alone...leave it alone...leave it alone
(we r the new power generation)
Don't u look at me
(we r the new power generation)
If you're sad and u know it and u think u want to blow it
Let your feelings out, love is there

Just go!

Kid! Yo Kid!
I got ta do this, I got the noise, I got ta do this
So pump the big noise, c'mon in the house...

This here rap's about the true confession
If ya listen close u 'bout to learn a lesson
U must know failure before success
Now this is the failure I must confess (well...)
I was hanging onto life trying deal with this
Playing the games, almost got dismissed
Cocaine was the thing that I took on
And nowhere was the place that I was going (preacher, cmon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed 4 the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top 2 the bottom 2 bottom 2 top
Success is where I'm headed there ain't no doubt
Success is something that we all want
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's somthing in it that's there 4 u
{on top of:
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise, somebody
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)}
Like I told ya before, I'm a tell ya again
Success is something that's deep within
So remember the truth you cant go wrong
The flesh is weak and the spirit is strong
I know it to do this rap, and I know its right
'cause I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
(cmon somebody lets party tonite)
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)

You want me 2 what?? (shake!)
What? (shake! shake!)
Awww, right

The New Power Generation has just taken control
