She got the brains - she got the looks
She knows all the right people - reads all the right books
She's got my name - she's got my number
But what she see's in me I sometimes wonder
She's a little too good for me
She's gonna change me if I let her
She's a little too good for me
But I'm getting better
I'm just a guy - I'm just me
I'm happy with my feet up on the table - in front of my TV
We're world's apart - we're night and day
She's dinner by candle light - I'm just a take-a-way
She's a little too good for me
She's gonna change me if I let her
She's a little too good for me
But I'm getting better
She's says I do something to her
All her friends say I'm a loser
