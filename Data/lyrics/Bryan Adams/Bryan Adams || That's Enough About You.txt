
Talking to you is like watching paint stay wet.
one way traffic is all I ever get.
I try to share my feelings but you're self obsessed.
I've had it up to here this thing's a mess.

I'm just trying to tell you that there has to be,
more to life than just me me me so hear this,
honey - I quit, we're through
listen to me - that's enough about you

You never did listen to a word I said,
dull over dinner and a bore in bed.
It's a no-win situation you just call collect,
was it too much to ask for a little repect?
