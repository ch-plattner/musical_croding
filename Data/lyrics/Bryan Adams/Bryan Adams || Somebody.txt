
I bin lookin' for someone 
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin' 
To ease the pain 
Now who can you turn to 
When it's all black and white 
And the winners are losers 
You see it every night 

I need somebody 
Somebody like you 
Everybody needs somebody 

I need somebody 
Hey what about you 
Everybody needs somebody 
When you're out on the front line 
And you're watchin' them fall 
It doesn't take long to realize 
It ain't worth fightin' for 

I thought I saw the Madonna 
When you walked in the room 
Well your eyes were like diamonds 
And they cut right through - oh they cut right through 

I need somebody 
Somebody like you 
Everybody needs somebody 
I need somebody 
Hey what about you 
We all need somebody 

Another night another lesson learned 
It's the distance keeps us sane 
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again - all again 

[Chorus]
