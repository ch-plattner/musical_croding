
i've been wandering around the house all night
wondering what the hell to do
i'm trying to concentrate but all i can think of is you
well the phone don't ring cuz my friends ain't home
i'm tired of being all alone
got the tv on cuz the radio's playing songs that remind me
of you

baby when you're gone - i realize i'm in love
the days go on and on - and the nights just seem so long
even food don't taste that good - drink ain't doing what it
should
things just feel so wrong - baby when you're gone

i've been driving up and down these streets
trying to find somewhere to go
ya i'm lookin' for a familiar face but there's no one i know

this is torture - this is pain - it feels like i'm gonna go
insane
i hope you're coming back real soon -cuz i don't know what
to do
