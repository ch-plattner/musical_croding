
You know you shook me
You shook me all night long.
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
And the way you love me baby
You makes a happy home

You know you love me
just like a hurricane
You know you love me baby
just like a hurricane

And the way you love me baby
the way you love me
You just miss it with my brain

You know you shook me, shook me, shook me, shook me
You shook me all night long

You shook me, baby
You shook me all night long.
And the way you love me baby
You makes a happy home

Come on!

Shook me
You know shook me

You shook me all night long

Yeah I know you love me

All night long
