
To really love a woman 
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - see every dream 
N' give her wings - when she wants to fly 
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman you tell her
that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her
that it's gonna last forever 
So tell me have you ever really 
- really really ever loved a woman? 

To really love a woman 
Let her hold you - 
til ya know how she needs to be touched 
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her 
Til you can feel her in your blood 
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes 
Ya know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman 
you tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her
that you'll always be together 
So tell me have you ever really - 
really really ever loved a woman? 

You got to give her some faith - hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right 
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you 
Ya really gotta love your woman...
