
I'd like to see you, thought I'd let you know
I wanna be with you everyday
Cause I've got a feeling that's beginning to grow
And there's only one thing I can say

I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - to hold you
I'm ready - I'm ready
Ready as I'm gonna be

She left me a long note when she left me here
Told me that love was hard to find
But baby it's easy and I'll make it clear
That there's only one thing on my mind

I'm ready - to love you
I'm ready - to hold you
I'm ready - I'm ready
Ready as I'm gonna be
