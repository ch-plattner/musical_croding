She got a nasty reputation and a talent for sin
She's the kinda trouble i'd like to be in
I wanna be a lover - I wanna be a slave
But she's the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave
So give it what you want boy - let's make it understood
That if ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good

She says there'll be no lying - no foolin' around
No seven day weekends - 
no nights on the town
Well that's the way I wast it - 
that's the way it's gotta be
If you're looking for trouble better get it from me
So get on your knees boy and do what you should
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good

No she makes the laws - 
she calls the shots
Do what she wants if you want what she's got
Can't have it both ways - you gotta chose
She can give you the rhythm or she can give you the blues
Oh, if you want sugar better bring it on home
Better keep it in the kitchen cuz that's where it belongs
You gotta make her happy boy
Just take it from me
Or you'll never get none of that tlc
If you're tryin' to get lucky 
- better knock on wood
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good
