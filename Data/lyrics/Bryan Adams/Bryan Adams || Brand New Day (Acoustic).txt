Johnny had a plan, gonna see the world
He knew he had to go
Gonna take his girl and then make the walk to Ontario
She said "why you looking at me that way?"
"You gonna go or you gonna stay?"

Get up, get up, get up, hear what I say
Wake up, wake up, wake up, go find a better way
Get up, get up, get up, it's a brand new day!

So we fly tonight on an east bound fray going anywhere
Driving through the night through the wind and rain and took him all the way there
Gone in the hours as the miles slipped away
In the sound of the wheels he could still hear her say

Get up, get up, get up, whatever it takes
Wake up, wake up, wake up, can your head shake? 
Get up, get up, get up, it's a brand new day!
It's a brand new day

Whatcha thinkin' about, man, you betta get out!
I'm gonna be someone, have my day in the sun
Whatever, you won't know if you won't try
So bye bye baby, bye bye baby, bye bye

Sometimes you lay awake thinkin' bout the things that you never told her
So on a starry night from the noisy bar you telephoned her
"You could come down, I'll meet your trainâ€¦"
She just laughed and said "some people never change"

Get up, get up, get up, hear what I say
Wake up, wake up, wake up, go find a better way
Get up, get up, get up, it's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day!
