
Who are you gonna run to, 
Now your ass is on the line. 
Who do you think you're foolin' 
We ain't got the time. 
Don't try to tell me, 
Who's wrong or right. 
Don't say that I 
There's no point in tryin' to change it at all. 

Tonight, tonight, 
Let's leave it alone, 
Leave it alone tonight, 
We can't change it at all. 
Forget the things I told you, 
Let's just sleep on it for now. 
It's your misunderstanding, 
I don't wanna hear you out. 

Two wrongs baby, 
They don't make a right.
It's hardly worth the heartache,
Let's leave it alone, leave it alone.
