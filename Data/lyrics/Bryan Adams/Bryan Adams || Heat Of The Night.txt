
I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream 
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream 
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light 
Cause you're livin' alone in the heat of the night 

Met a man with a message from the other side 
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind 
He said it's up to you 
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right) 
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night 

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around 
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down 
In the heat of the night 
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down) 
(Don't look back don't ever turn around) 

Had to pay the piper to call the tune 
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon 
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right 
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night
