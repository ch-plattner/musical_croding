
You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys
But if you wanna stop me baby - don't even try
I'm goin' one way - your way
It's such a strong way - let's make it our way

Can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we've plotted
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
Can't stop this thing we started - no way
I'm goin' your way!
You might stop the world spinnin' round
Might even walk on holy ground
I ain't Superman and I can't fly
But if you wanna stop me baby - don't even try
I'm goin' one way - your way
It's such a strong way - let's make it our way

Can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we've plotted
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
Can't stop this thing we started - no way
I'm goin' your way!

Oh - why take it slow
I gotta know 
Nothing can stop this thing that we got
