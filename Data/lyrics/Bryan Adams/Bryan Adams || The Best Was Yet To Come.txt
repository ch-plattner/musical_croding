Just a small town girl in the city lights 
The best was yet to come 
Then lonely days turned to endless nights
The best was yet to come 

How were you to know 
That you would be the lucky one 
Ain't it funny how time flies 
When the best is yet to come 

You can cry yourself to sleep at night 
You can't change the things you've done 
You had it there then it slipped away 
Yeah you left the song unsung 

Even through your tears 
I never saw you come undone 
What's so good about goodbye 
When the best was yet to come 

I find myself thinkin' about yesterday
When you were and livin' in a dream 
In the moment that it takes 
You find you made your first mistake 
Like the setting sun... 
You turn around it's gone 

Just a small town girl who had it made 
Or so the story goes 
She had it there then it slipped 
Oh - how was she to know 

Even through her tears 
I never saw her come undone
Ain't it funny how time flies 
When the best is yet to come 
What's so good about goodbye 
When the best was yet to come
