Then you've come to the right place baby
If the door is always open - if you need some company
Yeah you've come to the right place baby

Heaven knows I can't read your mind
We can turn it around darlin' one step at a time
Angel, oh angel can't you see
I can't live without you
Oh baby won't you help me please

When there's no one left to trust
Well I think you'll agree
That you've come to the right place baby
When you're down on your luck
Yeah just look around and you'll see
That you've come to the right place baby

Sometimes you don't know what you've got - 'til it's gone
But then you look around - and it was right there all along
Angel, yeah you gotta understand
I don't want be without you - oh won't you help me if you can

I ain't asking for the world - I just want you to believe
That you've come to the right place baby
When there's no one else to hold you
Well I'll be there yes indeed

Well you've come to the right place
Yes you've come to the right place
Well you've come to the right place
You've come to the right place baby
