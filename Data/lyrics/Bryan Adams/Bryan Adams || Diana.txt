
Oh the first time I saw you was in a magazine 
The next time you was walking 'cross my television screen 
I knew right then and there that I had to make you mine 
The day that he married you I nearly lost my mind 

Diana whatcha doin' with a guy like him 
Diana I'd die for you, please let me in 
Diana can't you see you drive me wild 
Diana I bet you're just a reckless child 

Yes, you got it made I've seen you promenade a time or two 
He might have lots of dough but I know he ain't right for you 
Cause I've watched you smile and shakin' hands when you do your social scene 
You wouldn't have to do that if you came and lived with me 

Diana just can't get you off my mind 
Diana why don't you leave it all behind 
Diana she is queen of all my dreams 
Diana gimme dreams, I'll set you free 

Since I saw that picture of you 
Nothing matters I just wanna lay ya 
We can make it, you and me 
So come on baby, come on baby, oh-oh yeah ...

(Yeah, here's how I see it)

Your one choice if you get away, leave it up to me
I'll bring you lovin' if you bring your limousine 

Diana whatcha doin' with a guy like him
Diana I'd die for you, please let me in 
Diana can't you see you drive me wild 
Diana I bet you're just a reckless child 

Diana oh yeah 
Diana you really got a hold on me 
Diana you gimme your tears I'll set you free 
Diana yeah - yeah
