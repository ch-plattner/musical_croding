Everywhere I go all the places that I've been 
Every smile is a new horizon on a land 
I've never seen 
There are people around the world - 
different faces different names 
But there's one true emotion that 
reminds me we're the same... 
Let's talk about love 

From the laughter of a child to the tears 
of a grown man 
There's a thread that runs right through us 
all and helps us understand 
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker 
to a flame 
From the very first sweet melody to the 
very last refrain... 

Let's talk about love 
Let's talk about us 
Let's talk about life 
Let's talk about trust 
Let's talk about love 

It's the king of all who live and the 
queen of good hearts 
It's the ace you may keep up your 
sleeve - till the name is all but lost 
As deep as any sea - with the rage of 
any storm 
But as gentle as a falling leave on any 
autumn morn... 

Let's talk about love - it's all we're 
needin' 
Let's talk about us - it's the air we're 
breathin' 
Let's talk about life - I wanna know you 
Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show 
you 
Let's talk about love
