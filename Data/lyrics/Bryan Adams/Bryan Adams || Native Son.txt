I've seen many moons through these wrinkled eyes 
The years have made me old but they've made me wise 
Now the white man lives where our rivers run 

For now better days have passed 
We walk the streets of broken glass 
Our people vanished as snow before the summer sun 
Like dogs we were driven from this place 
Such injustice, time will not erase 
All these changes cannot be undone 

When you feel the anger inside of you 
Hold your head high - let your aim be true 
Though your heart beats like a drum 
My native son 

Once there was a time my little one 
Before the wagons - before the soldiers' guns 
When this land was ours as far as the eagle flies 

No white flag - no broken truce 
With few words one can speak the truth - I don't hear it
Time won't heal it now 

With each new day that comes to pass 
Will the great spirit free us all at last? 
He said we were the chosen ones 

For all we had there's nothin' left 
We wonâ€™t forgive - we can't forget 
You know that your day will come 
My native son 

With each new day that comes to pass 
Will the great spirit free us all at last? 
What has happened can never be undone 

When I was young - not yet a man 
The sun rose and set upon our land 
We were the chosen ones 
My native son
