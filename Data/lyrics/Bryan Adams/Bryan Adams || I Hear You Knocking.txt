
You went away and left me long time ago 
And now you're knocking on my door 

I hear you knocking 
But you can't come in 

I hear you knocking 
Go back where you've been 

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye 
And now you're telling me all your lies 

I hear you knocking 
But you can't come in 

I hear you knocking 
Go back where you've been 

Ahhh yeah 
Let me hear it 
Ohhooo woo 
OOhh 

You better get to your use-to-be 
'Cause your kind of love ain't good to me

I hear you knocking 
But you can't come in 

I hear you knocking 
Go back where you've been 

I told you way back in 52
That I would never go with you

I hear you knocking 
But you can't come in 

I hear you knocking
Go back where you've been 

Yeah 
Awwhoooo
