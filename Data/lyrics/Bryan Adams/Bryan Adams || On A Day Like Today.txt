
Free is all you gotta be
dream dreams no one else can see
sometimes ya wanna run away
but ya never know what might be comin' round your way
ya ya ya

On a day like today
the whole world could change
the sun's gonna shine
shine thru the rain
on a day like today
ya never wanna see the sun go down
ya never wanna see the sun go down

Somewhere - there's a place for you
I know that you believe it too 
sometimes if you wanna get away
all ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay
all the way

On a day like today - the whole world could change
the sun's gonna shine - shine thru the rain
on a day like today - no one complains
free to be pure - free to be sane
on a day like today
ya never wanna see the sun go down
ya never wanna see the sun go down

Free is all we gotta be
dream dreams no one else can see 
but ya never know what might be comin' for you and me
ya it's gonna be

on a day like today...
