
We found our strength - we found our way at last
We found tomorrow - by building on our past
We paid our dues - we stick together - come whatever

We're still standin' - didn't fall to pieces
Never lost our reason - never stopped believin'

We found our wings and now we fly above the wind
You and me - we found what we're looking for

We gave it all - gave our very best
With every fall - we withstood the test
We broke the rules
Had to do it - to get thru it 

We found our wings together we found everything
You and me - we found what we're looking for
You made me shine - picked me up when I fell behind
With you - I never need to search no more

We're still standin' - didn't fall to pieces
Never lost our reason - never stopped believin'
Ah never stopped - believin'

We found our wings and together we found everything
You and me - we found what we're looking for
You made me shine picked me up when I fell behind
With you - I never need to search no more
You and me we found what we were looking for
