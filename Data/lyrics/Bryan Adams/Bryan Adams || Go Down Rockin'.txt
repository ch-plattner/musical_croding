If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down rockin'
I ain't gonna slow down, I'm gonna go down rockin'

No one gonna tell me what to say
Or tell me what to do
You can't tell me what to play
You think you know what I got a clue

If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down rockin'
I ain't gonna slow down, I'm gonna go down rockin'

You can't tell me where to go
You gotta put me in my place
You don't know but now you will never gonna know
If you got a problem better tell me into my face

If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down rockin'
I ain't gonna slow down, I'm gonna go down rockin'
If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down rockin'
I ain't gonna slow down, I'm gonna go down rockin'

No one gonna tell me what to say
Or tell me what to do
You can't tell me what to play
You think you know what I got a clue

I ain't gonna slow down
I'm gonna go down rockin'
I ain't gonna slow down
I'm gonna go down rockin'
