Everything's been said, A hundred times 
Everything's been said, A hunderd times 

Then I know, if I know you 
It takes one more time 
No one holds the night, 
The way you do 
No one holds the night 
The way you do 
Then I know, If I know you 
It takes one more night 

No one makes it right 
Like you do Like you do 
No one makes it right 
Like you do Like you do 
No one makes it right like you 

I guess you're moving out
So you say 
I guess you're moving out
So you say 
Oh I know if I know you 
I've got no more saying 

No one makes it right 
Like you do Like you do 
No one makes it right 
Like you do Like you do 
No one makes it right like you 

I said it once 
I said it always
