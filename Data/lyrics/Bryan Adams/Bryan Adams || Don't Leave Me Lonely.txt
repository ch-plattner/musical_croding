
I won't stand bein' broken hearted 
I won't be pushed around 

The rules were set when we got started 
But lately I have found 

We've spent too little time and too much heartache 
I feel we're losin' ground 

And lately I've been hearin' 
You won't be needin' me around 

Don't leave me lonely 
Just wanna be right by your side
Your one and only - tonite 

So don't leave me lonely 
I need you here all the time 
So don't leave me lonely - oh no

You say you need your independence 
Well I need mine 

Separate lives and separate feelings
I guess that's fine 

But that won't last - it's no solution
I know it can't survive 

And lately I've been thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time
