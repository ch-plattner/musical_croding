People believe what they wanna believe 
You gotta give thanks for what you're 'bout to receive
You might a bit off more than you could chew 
But deep inside you stay true to you 

You gotta - do what ya gotta do 
You gotta - do what ya gotta do 
You gotta - do what ya gotta do 

You might take a hit - you might take a punch 
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch 
Nobody knows what you've been through 
Or what it's like to be in your shoes 

You gotta - do what ya gotta do - ya 
Do what ya gotta do 
Do what ya gotta do 
Do what ya gotta do 

What goes around comes around 
You gotta keep both feet on the ground 
You might a bit off more than you can chew 
But deep inside you stay true to you 

You gotta - do what ya gotta do 
Do what ya gotta do 
You gotta - do what ya gotta do - ya 
Do what ya gotta do
