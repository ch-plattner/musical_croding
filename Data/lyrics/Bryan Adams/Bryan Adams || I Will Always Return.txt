I hear the wind call your name 
It calls me back home again 
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns 
Oh it's to you I'll always return 
I still feel your breath on my skin 
I hear your voice deep within 
The sound of my lover - a feeling so strong 
It's to you - I'll always belong 

Now I know it's true 
My every road leads to you 
And in the hour of darkness darlin' 
Your light gets me through 

Wanna swim in your river - be warmed by your sun
Bathe in your waters - cos you are the one 
I can't stand the distance - I can't dream alone 
I can't wait to see you - Ya I'm on my way home 

Oh I hear the wind call your name 
The sound that leads me home again 
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns 
Oh, it's to you - I will always return
