
I think I told you maybe once or twice before, 
They'll only hold you down, 
leave you wanting more. 
But you refuse to listen, babe,
so this is where you'll stay, 
If you weren't so bloody juvenile, 
you'd be some where today. 
If you want it, you got it,
If you want it, you got it, 
If you want it, you got it now. 

You think you want a break but I got news for you, 
I think it's time you start believing your reviews. 
Stood me up and shot me down so many times before,
But dropping names and playing games won't get you through my door.

If you want it, you got it, 
If you want it, you got it, 
If you want it, you got it now.
