Shake! 
shake! 

Listen while I talk to you 
I'll tell you what we're gonna do 
There's a new thing that's goin' around 
and I'll tell you what they're puttin' it down 
Just move your body round & round 
and just shake 

Aw mama shake 
That's the way to do it 
Shake! 
Aw you're lookin' good now, shake!

Shake it like a bowl of soup 
Make your body loop the loop 
Put your hands on your hips 
Kind a let your backbone slip 
Move your body like a whip 
and just Shake 
Um that's done it 
Shake! 

Yeah, you're lookin' good now 
Shake! 
Shake! 

Ding-a-ling 
Honey, shkin' is the latest thing 
and if you want to swing just loosen up your shoulders 
If you want to really roll 
You got to do the thing with soul 

Shake the shake with all your might 
and if you do it, do it right 

Just make your body loose and light 
and just Shake! 

Aw honey Shake!
Oh, shake! 
Aw that's the way to do it 
Shake!
