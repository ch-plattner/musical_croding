
You need a man that'll treat you like the woman you are 
Those little boys are just fooling around with your heart 
Whatcha gonna do now that you're all alone? 
You need a rock not a rollin' stone 
Yeah so when a boy 
just ain't enough 
You need a man made of stronger stuff 
Get ready 
Rock steady all night long 

Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true 
Rock steady 
Just me and you 

You need somebody who will help you with your heavy load 
Well I've been there baby 
Lord give me a rock and roll 
Well I can bend but I won't break
cause you ain't got what I can take 
So when you're tired of those little girls 
you want a woman that'll rock your world 
Get ready 

Rock steady all night long 
Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true 
Rock steady 
Just me and you 

Amateurs and dilettantes 
They can't give you what you really want
When all the other have been untrue 
I'll give you something you can hold on to 
Rock steady all night long 
Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true 
Rock steady 
Just me and you
