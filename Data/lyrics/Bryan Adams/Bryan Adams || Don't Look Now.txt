Now you took your love from me, 
When I needed it most, 
I wanted you so desperately, 
So baby, 
Don't look now cause I'm comin' around,
Baby don't look now cause I'm comin' around.

You planned it all so carefully, 
You just faded to black, 
And even in your wildest dreams, 
You never thought I'd be back 
So you thought you'd seen the last of me, 
Now ya better think twice, 
You can't fool me that easily, 
Now baby, 

Don't look now cause I'm comin' around, 
Baby don't look now cause I'm comin' around.

Now ya better think twice, 
You can't fool me that easily, Now baby, 

Don't look now cause I'm comin' around, 
Baby don't look now cause I'm comin' around.
