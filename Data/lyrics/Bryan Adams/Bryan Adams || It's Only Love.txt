There ain't no use pretendin' 
Don't ya worry - it's only love 

When your world has been shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over - it's only love 
And that's all - ya 
When your heart has been broken 
Hard words have been spoken 
It ain't easy - but it's only love 

And if your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember - that it's only love 

You can live without the aggravation 
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win 

You keep lookin' back in desperation 
Over and over and over again 

When your world is shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over - it's only love 

If your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember - that it's only love 
Ya - that's all 

Ya it ain't easy baby 
But it's only love - and that's all
