I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me
Must've 'bin blind 

She didn't give me a warning 
Said I shouldn't treat you wrong 
But when I woke up this mornin' 
She was gone gone gone 

She said... 
Take me back won't ya
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

She didn't tell me about it 
Am I supposed to read your mind 
You make me get up and shout it 
It's a crime crime crime 

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me 
Must've 'bin blind 

She said...
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

Won't ya take me back 
Won't ya take me back
