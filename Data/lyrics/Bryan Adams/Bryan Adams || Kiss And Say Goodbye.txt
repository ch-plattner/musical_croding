
I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darling, oh don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Many months have passed us by
(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
I've got ties, and so do you
(I'm gonna miss you)
I just think this is the thing to do
(Yes I do)

It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet,
maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me
Won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Understand me, I won't you try
won't you try
(I'm gonna miss you)
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
I take my handkerchief and wipe your eyes
(I'm gonna miss you)
Maybe you'll find,
maybe you'll find another guy

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's just kiss and say goodbye
