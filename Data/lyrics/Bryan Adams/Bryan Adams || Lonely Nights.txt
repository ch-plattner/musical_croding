
Will you risk your reputation? 
I don't know. 
You just don't know what you're sayin'
Anymore.

You know beggers can't be chosers, 
And that's fair. 
When we win we may be losers, 
I don't care, no no no. 
Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night, 
So come over and save me, 
Save me from another lonely night.
I hear every word you're sayin' 
They're all lies. 
But with every breath you're takin'
You're thinkin' of ways to say good night.
