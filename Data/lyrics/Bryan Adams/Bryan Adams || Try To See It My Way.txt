
Ooh ... Try to see it my way.
Ooh ... Try to see it my way. 

Well, I know you cover up
From all the things you did 
That tied you up. 
Just wanna let you know 
That I wanna keep you warm 
Until the sun warms up the dark. 

So move in a little closer,
Then you can think it over, 
Just try to see it my way. 
Think it over, 
Just try to see it my way.

Well, you said you needed time 
for all the things 
That run around your mind 
How can I let you know 
That I wanna keep you warm
Until the sun warms up the dark. 

So move in a little closer, 
Then you can think it over, 
Try to see it my way. 
Think it over, 
Try to see it my way.

Think it over. 
Think it over. 
Try to see it my way, my way. 
Think it over. 
Just Try to see it my way.
