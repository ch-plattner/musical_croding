
This is story about a boy and girl
Trying find a life in the big world
Somehow they're together
There ain't much to the mystery
Misery loves company
She just waves her hand and says whatever
Well this ain't love this ain't love this ain't love at all
And he says...
We're not Romeo we're not Juliet
Hw long does it take to fill this emptyness
We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets
We don't wanna say bye-bye
Babe it's just you and I
We're not Romeo we're not Juliet
He ain't pretty with his hard old heart
Second generation immigrant scars
And he knows that this ain't heaven - no
She's all skinny like a cigarette
And he's the only thing - the only thing that she respects
And he's trying to make it better
This ain't love this ain't love this ain't love at all
And she says...
We're not Romeo - not Juliet
You'd thought you'd seen it all - but you ain't seen nothin' yet
We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets
Now it's just you and I
We're nothin' unless we try
We're not Romeo - not Juliet
It has feel right but it never does
It has to be perfect but it never is
You wanna be sure but you never do
We're not Romeo or Juliet - it's just me and you
Ya it's just you and I
We're nothin' unless we try - oh no
We're not Romeo - not Juliet
No we're not - that's a fact
