
Lock the door and close the curtain 
No more lies, I'm tired of hurtin' 
I think you know what I mean 
There's an empty sound that lonely makes 

Don't know how much more that I can take 
And yesterday was just a dream 
Yesterday was just a dream 

Nothin's ever what it seems 
Tomorrow's comin' - it won't be long 
Yesterday is here and gone 

Words tumble out like an open book 
While the world was turning, something shook 
From a whisper to a scream 

Rain's beatin' down on the window pane 
Makes me wonder about you again 
And yesterday was just a dream 
Yesterday was just a dream 

Nothin's ever what it seems 
Tomorrow's comin' - it won't be long 
Yesterday is here and gone 

Tell me what's it for, this life we're living 
The world is cold and unforgiving 
And your smile is so serene 
Yesterday was just a dream 

Nothin's ever what it seems 
Tomorrow's comin' - it won't be long 
Yesterday is here and gone 
Ma, it's here and gone
