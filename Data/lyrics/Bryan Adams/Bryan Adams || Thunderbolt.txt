
Like a thunderbolt - comin' straight down from the sky 
Like a thunderbolt - don't it make you wonder why? 
Like nothin' you could imagine 
A shiver lookin' for a spine 

Hold onto the throttle - capture lightnin' in a bottle 
Let's lay it all on the line 
Like a thunderbolt - a shot right out of the blue 
Like a thunderbolt 

Tell me what you gonna do about it 
Like manna from the heavens 
The sweetest grape on the vine 
Gotta risk it for the biscuit - and I don't wanna miss it 
If it's meant to be, it's worth a try 

Like a thunderbolt - comin' straight down from the sky 
Like a thunderbolt - don't it make you wonder why? 
Thunder - straight down from the sky 
Thunder - make you wonder why 
Thunder - right out of the blue 
Thunder - oh whatcha gonna do? 

Like a thunderbolt 
Like a thunderbolt - comin' straight down from the sky 
Like a thunderbolt - don't it make you wonder why? 
Hit me like a thunderbolt 

A shot right out of the blue 
Hit me like a thunderbolt 
Tell me what you gonna do about it? 
Like a thunderbolt
