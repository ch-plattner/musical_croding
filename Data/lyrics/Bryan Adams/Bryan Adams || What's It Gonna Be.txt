
If it was up to me 
I'd say it's his decision
And maybe you should wait and see 
You haven't got a choice 
You gotta second guess him 
So go ahead 

What's it gonna be 
Well you need an answer 
What's it gonna be 
All you get is no reply 

If it was up to you 
You'd say you need protection 
When all you really need is me 
Now that's the bottom line 
It's your sincere intention 
So go ahead 

What's it gonna be 
Well you need an answer 
What's it gonna be 
All you get is no reply 

What's it gonna be 
Well you need an answer 
What's it gonna be 
All you get is no reply 

You've been waiting for so long 
Now you say you can't go on 
You can't go on, oh no
