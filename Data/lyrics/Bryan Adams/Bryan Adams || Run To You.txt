She says her love for me could never die 
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I

Oh - but her love is cold 
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause...

When it gets too much 
I need to feel your touch 

I'm gonna run to you 
I'm gonna run to you 
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night 
I'm gonna run to you 
She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down 
But you're the one that always turns me on 
You keep me comin' 'round 

I know her love is true 
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you 

I got my mind made up 
I need to feel your touch 

I'm gonna run to you 
Ya - I'm gonna run to you 
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night 

I'm gonna run to you 
Ya - I'm gonna run to you 
Oh when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night 
I'm gonna run to you
