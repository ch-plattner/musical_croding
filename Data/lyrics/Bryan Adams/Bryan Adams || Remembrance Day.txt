
For our king and our country and the promise of glory 
We came from Kingston and Brighton to fight on the front line 

Just lads from the farms and boys from the cities
Not meant to be soldiers we lay in the trenches 

We'd face the fighting with a smile - or so we said 
If only we had known what danger lay ahead 

The sky turned to grey as we went into battle 
On the fields of Europe young men were fallin' 

I'll be back for you someday - it won't be long 
If I can just hold on 'til this bloody war is over 

The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day 
There'll be no more fighting on Remembrance Day

By October of 18 Cambrai had fallen 
Soon the war would be over and we'd be returnin' 

Don't forget me while I'm gone far away 
Well it won't be long 'till I'm back there in your arms again 

One day soon - I don't know when 
You know we'll all be free and the bells of peace will ring again 

The time will come for you and me 
We'll be goin' home when this bloody war is ended 

The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day 
We'll all say a prayer on Remembrance Day 

On Remembrance Day - say a little prayer 
On Remembrance Day

Well the guns will be silent 
There'll be no more fighting 
Oh we'll lay down our weapons 
On Remembrance Day
