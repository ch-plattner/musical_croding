
c'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
c'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

the nite is alive - the world is asleep
dreaming of promises they can't keep
we gotta be tough we gott a be strong
it's only love we've been waiting on

c'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
c'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

it's only a dream - it's all in your head
it's only some words somebody said
we can believe what we wanna believe
and you can believe in me

c'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
c'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright
c'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
c'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright
