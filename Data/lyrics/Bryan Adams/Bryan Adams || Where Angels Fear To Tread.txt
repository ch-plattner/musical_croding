well i'm wrapped around your finger
i'm never letting go
you know i'm happy just to linger
and let the feeling flow

this must be an illusion
i know this can't be real
but right here and right now
this is paradise i feel

i never thought i'd find someone to move me
someone who could see right thru me
you found your way into my head
where even angels fear to tread

don't wanna go out walkin
don't wanna take a drive
don't wanna move from this sweet spot baby
while this feelin's still alive

the way we fit together
it's like we're meant to be
and right here and right now
this is paradise to me
