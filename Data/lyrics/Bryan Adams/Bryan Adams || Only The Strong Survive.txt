
When the pressure's on and you're all alone
Take a little ride into the danger zone 
When the moon is up and the skies are clear 
Just show me a sign and we'll be outa here 
Take me up on a wing and a prayer 
If you need a friend you know I'll be there

Hound dogs howlin' all through the night 
Eight miles high and I'm doin' alright 
Better move over 'cause you're goin' too slow
I feel the need for freedom now it's time to go 

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain 
Let your conscience be your guide 'til we meet again 

Your time has come - you can stand or you can run 
But don't keep it all inside 
Cause you gotta understand that there ain't no second chance
No-one gets outa here alive - only the strong survive 

Tearin' it up goin' down the track 
Gonna fly so high, I might never come back
If things get tough you can count me in 
Cause if you play the game you gotta play to win 

Take me up where only angels can fly 
If you need a helpin' hand I won't pass you by 

Your time has come - you can stand or you can run 
But don't keep it all inside 
Cause you gotta understand that there ain't no second chance 
No-one gets outa here alive - only the strong survive 

[Solo]

Take me up on a wing and a prayer 
If you need someone you know I'll be there 

Your time has come - you can stand or you can run 
But don't keep it all inside
Cause you gotta understand that there ain't no second chance 
No-one gets outa here alive 

Only the strong survive 
Only the strong survive 
Well I'm doin' what I can - you gotta understand 
Only the strong survive
