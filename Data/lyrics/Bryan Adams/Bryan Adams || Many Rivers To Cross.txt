But I can't seem to find my way 
Wanderin', I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
I got Many rivers to cross 
And it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
and I merely survive because of my pride.

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be in on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
But I guess, I gotta try

I got many rivers to cross but where to begin, I'm playin' for time
There'll be times when I find myself thinkin' of committin' some, some dreadful crime.

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be in on your own
My woman left me and she didn't, didn't say why
But I guess, I gotta try

I've got so many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wanderin' I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover

I got so many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for my years
and I merely survive because of my pride.

Many rivers to cross 
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wanderin' I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover

I got so many river to cross
