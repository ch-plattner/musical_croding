
You can't take me
Yeah

Got to fight another fight
I gotta run another night
Get it out
check it out
I'm on my way and I don't feel right
I gotta get me back
I can't be beat and that's a fact
It's OK
I'll find a way
You ain't gonna take me down no way

Don't judge a thing until you know what's inside it
Don't push me
I'll fight it
Never gonna give in
never gonna give it up, no
If you can't catch a wave then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in
never gonna give it up, no
You can't take me
I'm free

Why did it all go wrong?
I wanna know what's going on
And what's this holding me?
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I gotta fight another fight
I gotta fight with all my might
I'm getting out, so check it out
you're in my way
Yeah, you better watch out

Oh, come on!

Don't judge a thing until you know what's inside it
Don't push me
I'll fight it
Never gonna give in
never gonna give it up, no
If you can't catch a wave then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in
never gonna give it up, no
You can't take me
I'm free
