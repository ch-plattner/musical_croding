As every day goes by
How can we close our eyes
Until we open up our hearts

We can learn to share
And show how much we care
Right from the moment that we start

Seems like overnight
We see the world in a different light
Somehow our innocence is lost

How can we look away
'Cause every single day
We've got to help at any cost

We can bridge the distance
Only we can make the difference
Don't ya know that tears are not enough

If we can pull together
We could change the world forever
Heaven knows that tears are not enough

It's up to me and you
To make the dream come true
It's time to take our message everywhere

C'est l'amour qui nous rassemble
D'ici ?l'autre bout du monde
Let's show them Canada still cares
You know that we'll be there

If we should try together you and I
Maybe we could understand the reasons why
If we take a stand every woman, child and man
We can make it work for God's sake lend a hand
