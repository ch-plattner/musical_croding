She left her shoes out on the beach
She left my dreams just out of reach
She left her footprints in the sand
She was a bird right in the hand
I met a girl that made me laugh
She left a faded photograph
I thought I heard a siren song
I sang along but I was... 
I was only dreamin'
I was only dreamin'
Visions in my head
Talkin in my sleep
Turning in my bed
Life was so complete
Her shoes were on the beach
But I was only dreamin'
I met a girl that talked in rhyme
I met a girl who took her time
I saw the ocean in her eyes
I saw myself unrecognized
And all the stars up in the sky
Fell down like rain and made me cry
I held the world right in my hands
I held her close but I was...
