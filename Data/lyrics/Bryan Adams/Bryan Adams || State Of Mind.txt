I know that you're curious, 
So don't be serious, 
You know there's no cause for alarm.

When you're down - out 
Left here in doubt, 
All the things that are right will go wrong. 

Love is a state of mind, 
It's keepin' us both alive, 
Sometimes it's hard to find. 
Love's in a state of mind. 

Wait just a minute, 
You know that it's finished, 
So don't you go carry it on. 

Cause I'm down - out 
Left here in doubt, 
Well, we try but we can't get along. 

Love is a state of mind,
It's keepin' us both alive, 
Sometimes it's hard to find. 
Love's in a state of mind.
