Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss, it's gettin' better, baby
No one can better this...
Still holdin' on, you're still the one.
First time our eyes met, same feelin' I get
Only feels much stronger, wanna love you longer
You still turn the fire on...

So if you're feelin' lonely—don't
You're the only one I ever want.
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should...

Please forgive me
I know not what I do.
Please forgive me
I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me.
This pain I'm going through...
Please forgive me if I need you like I do.
Please believe me.
Every word I say is true...
Please forgive me
I can't stop loving you

Still feels like our best times are together.
Feels like the first touch, still gettin' closer, baby
Can't get close enough.
Still holdin' on, you're still number one.
I remember the smell of your skin,
I remember everything,
I remember all your moves
I remember you, yeah!
I remember the nights, you know I still do.

So if you're feelin' lonely—don't
You're the only one I ever want.
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should...

Please forgive me
I know not what I do.
Please forgive me
I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me
This pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me if I need you like I do
Oh, believe me.
Every word I say is true.
Please forgive me
I can't stop loving you.

One thing I'm sure of is the way we make love.
And one thing I depend on is for us to stay strong.
With every word and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'...

Please forgive me
I know not what I do.
Please forgive me
I can't stop lovin' you.
Don't deny me.
This pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me if I need you like I do.
Babe, believe me.
Every word I say is true.
Please forgive me if I can't stop loving you.
Never leave me
I don't know what I'd do.
Please forgive me
I can't stop loving you,
Can't stop loving you.
