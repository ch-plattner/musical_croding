
Couldn't feel much better
Than the way I fell tonight
Feel like Icould live forever
Feel like I could fly
When I thought I'd get it wrong, yeah
You somehow make things right
That's the way you make me feel
Better than I've ever known it
Better than it's ever been
I can't seem to control it, no
The way you make me feel
Like the sun coming up in the morning
Like holding the world in your hands
In a way I could never imagine (yeah)
The way you make me feel

I couldn't feel much better
Than when I'm here with you
You make everything seem so easy
I'm telling you the truth
You never try to please me
But somehow...you always do

[CHORUS]

The way you make me feel, yeah
The way you make me feel

The simple things you do to me
Simple things you say
I sometimes can't believe it's for real

[CHORUS]

The way you make me feel, yeah
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
