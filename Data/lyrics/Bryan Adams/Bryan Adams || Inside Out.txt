the biggest lie you ever told - your deepest fear 'bout growin' old
the longest night you ever spent - the angriest letter you never sent
the boy you swore you'd never leave - the one you kissed on new years's eve
the sweetest dream you had last night -- your darkest hour, your hardest fight

I wanna know you - like I know myself
I'm waitin' for you - there ain't no one else
talk to me baby - scream and shout
I want to know you - inside out
I wanna dig down deep - I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout - I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time - I wanna know your mind
ya know there ain't no doubt - I wanna know you inside out

the saddest song you ever heard - the most you said with just one word
the loneliest prayer you ever prayed - the truest vow you ever made
what makes you laugh, what makes you cry what makes you mad, what gets you by
you highest hight, your lowest low - these things I want to know

I wanna know you - like I know myself
I'm waitin' for you - there ain't no one else
talk to me baby - scream and shout
I want to know you - inside out
I wanna dig down deep - I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout - I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time - I wanna know your mind
ya know there ain't no doubt - I wanna know you inside out
I wanna know your soul - I wanna lose control
c'mon n' let it out - I wanna know you inside out
ya gotta dig down deep - I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout - I wanna know you inside out
tell me everything...
