
If words won't do it
and words are just a waste of time
we could get right to it
if I could only read your mind

you're just a mistery to me
deeper than the deep blue sea
there must be something that will melt your heart
baby tell me just where to start

[chorus:]
what would it take to get you closer
what would it take just to stir your soul
what can I do to make you love me
just the thought of you
keeps me lying away 
tell me what would it take 

if the night don't move you
and you've never seen the stars come out
if the touch don't soothe you
then maybe you've just never been touched
I wanna be the one to change your mind
I think about it all the time 
??
I wanna wake you from your deepest sleep


you're just a mistery to me
deeper than the deep blue sea
there must be something that will melt your heart
baby tell me just where to start

[chorus:]
what would it take to get you closer
what would it take just to stir your soul
what can I do to make you love me
just the thought of you
keeps me lying away 
tell me what would it take 

tell me what would it take
tell me what would it take
tell me tell me
tell me what would it take
tell me what would it take
tell me tell me
tell me what would it take
tell me what would it take
