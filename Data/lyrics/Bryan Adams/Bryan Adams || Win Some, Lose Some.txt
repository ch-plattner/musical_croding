
Now you know 
That I stood outside your window 
Just a little too long. 

What you're gonna do 
When the hours pass away 
And you know that I'm gone. 
Well, it may be a week, 
It may be a day, 
I'm six blocks over 
And I don't know what to say to you.

Jokin' 'bout your mama 
Went a little too far. 
But you caught me 
Out with the others 
Till the early dawn. 

There may be a time 
If we played it right 
I'm six blocks over 
And you wanna spend a night with me. 

Now the hours and the minutes 
Just fly away. 
You win some and you lose some, 
You gotta get it right 
Or I'll be saying 
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye.

Thinkin' back to 
The way you're holdin' me down, 
I'd be better off dead. 

Now you know 
That the time is running out 
Of the things we said. 

Well, it may be a week, 
It may be a day, 
I'm six blocks over 
And I don't know what to say to you.

Now the hours and the minutes
Just fly away. 
You win some and you lose some, 
You gotta get it right 
Or I'll be saying 
Bye bye bye bye ...
