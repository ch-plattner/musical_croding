
We're always on the run these days
We hardly have the time to say
What matters most of all
Ya you've always been the only one
The only one to make me run
Anytime you call
Let's not talk about the future
Let's not talk about the days gone past
All this time - we've been runnin' round in circles
I can feel a change a comin'
And I know we're gonna make it last
From now on - we'll be goin' somewhere slowly
Instead of going nowhere fast
When everything has come and gone
We'll look back on this road we're on
And see how far we've come (ya we've come a long way)
Faster than the days go by
I know we're gonna make them last
Instead of goin' nowhere fast
