
Well you take it all for granted, 
So it should come as no surprise, 
That your big balloon is gonna burst, 
Right before your eyes. 

Well you always call your mama, 
Just for sympathy yeah, 
But I tried to show you years ago, 
So don't come crying to me. 
Now it's your last chance the night is over, 
Last chance for love, 
Well you can blame it on the bosanova,
You can't blame me when I'm gone. 
Well you call me up for favours, 
You say that it's my turn, 
Well I think I'll stand on my hard earned drive, 
And watch your bridges burn. 

Well I saw my Guardian Angel, 
He said I can refuse, 
Well I'd take the chance but it's hard to dance, 
With size 8 concrete shoes. 

Well you take it all for granted, 
So it should come as no surprise, 
That your big balloon is gonna burst, 
Right before your eyes.
