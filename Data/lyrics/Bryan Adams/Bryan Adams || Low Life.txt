
I've been on my best behaviour
my conscience is a little too clean
my halo's just a little too tight now
I'm tired of the old routine

So baby lets get down and dirty
forget about right from wrong
I wanna sleep in a cheap motel room
with nothing but the tv on

We need a little of the low life
to keep our feet on the ground
just a little of the low life
sooner or later we gotta get down to the low life
Yeah !

Well I don't wanna talk religion
don't wanna talk politics
I don't wanna talk at all babe
I just wanna get my kicks
so c'mon baby let your hair down
you can chuck your pearls out the door
just a little black lace and a smile on your face
never need nothing more.

We need a little of the low life
to keep our feet on the ground
just a little of the low life
sooner or later we gotta get down to the low life
Yeah
I'm talking low babe

Now baby you don't wanna talk about your day
and you sure don't wanna hear 'bout mine
I'll meet you at the notell motel
underneath the vacancy sign
we need alittle of the low life
to keep our feet on the ground
just a little of the low life

Yeah sooner or later you gotta get down to the low life
just a little bit of foolin' around
we need a little of the low life
oh babe
we need a little of the low low life yeah
let's get down and dirty low, low life
