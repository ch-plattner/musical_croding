
I wanna be your t-shirt when i
t's wet - wanna be the 
shower when you sweat 
I gotta to be the tattoo on your skin - ya lemme be your 
bed baby - when you climb in 
I wanna be the sheets when you sleep - lemme be the 
secrets that you keep 
I gotta be the spoon - ta stir your cream 
I wanna to be the one that really makes you scream 
I wanna be - your lipstick when ya lick it 
I wanna be - your high heels when ya kick it 
I wanna be - your sweet love babe - ya when you make it
From your feet up to your hair - more than anything I swear 

I wanna be - your underwear 

I wanna be the itch that you scratch - wanna be your 
chair when you relax 
I got to be your razor when you shave
Wanna be the habit that really makes you crave
I wanna be - your hot tub - when you're dippin' 
I wanna be - your bathrobe - when you're drippin' 
I wanna be - your cocktail baby - when you're sippin' 
I just wanna be right there - more than anything I swear 

I wanna be - your underwear 

Wanna be your sleepin' bag - baby slip inside 
Let me be your motorcycle n' take ya for a ride - 
alright 
I wanna be - your hot sauce - ya when you're cookin' 
I wanna be - your sunglasses - hey good lookin' 
I wanna be - wanna be the one - ya stick your hook in'
I just wanna be right there - more than anything I swear 

Oh ya I wanna be - your underwear
