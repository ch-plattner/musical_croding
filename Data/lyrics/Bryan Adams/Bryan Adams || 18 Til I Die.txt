Wanna be young - the rest of my life
Never say no - try anything twice
Til the angels come - and ask me to fly
Gonna be 18 til I die - 18 til I die
Can't live forever - that's wishful thinkin'
Who ever said that - must of bin' drinkin'
Don't wanna grow up - I don't see why
I couldn't care less if time flies by

18 til I die - gonna be 18 til I die
Ya it sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55! - 18 til I die

Anyway - I just wanna say
Why bother with what happened yesterday
It's not my style - I live for the minute
If ya wanna stay young - get both feet in it - 18 til I die
A 'lil bit of this - a 'lil bit of that
'Lil bit of everything - gotta get on track
It's not how ya look, it's what ya feel inside
I don't care when - I don't need ta know why

18 til I die - gonna be 18 til I die
Ya it sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55! - 18 til I die

Ya there's one thing for sure - I'm sure gonna try

Don't worry 'bout the future
Forget about the past
Gonna have a ball - ya we're gonna have a blast
Gonna make it last

18 til I die - gonna be 18 til I die
Ya it sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55! - 18 til I die

gonna be 18 til I die
I gonna be 18 til I die
18 til I die
