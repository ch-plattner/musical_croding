What cha gonna do - when your time is up 
What cha gonna say - when things go wrong 
What cha wanna do - when you're on your own 

There's a road - long and winding 
The lights are blindin' - but it gets there
Don't give up - don't look back 
There's a silver linin' - it's out there somewhere 
Everybody wants an answer - everybody needs a friend 
We all need a shinin' star on which we can depend 
N' so tonight we're gonna wish upon a star 
We never wished upon before - (to find what you're 
looking for) 
There'll be times - in your life
Ya when you' be dancin' n' shit - but you ain't gettin it
But don't get disillusioned - no, don't expect too much 
Cuz if what you have is all you can get - just keep on 
tryin' - it just ain't happened yet 
Everybody wants ta be winner - everybody has a dream 
We all need a shinin' star when things ain't what they seem 
So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star 
We never wished upon before - (gotta get where you're 
headed for) 

Everybody wants some kindness - everybody needs a break 
We all need a shinin' star when things get hard to take 
So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star 
We never wished upon before
