
The telephone's bin ringin' - ringin' off the wall 
It's your Las Vegas lawyer - another long distance call
He says you get the house and the car 
And I get the clothes I got on 
Now she's gone
Long, long, long, long gone 
Now I'm a happy boy 

She's long, long, long, long gone 

Operator get me Manhatten - get my baby on the line 
Sooner or later she's gotta realize 
That all my feelin's were for real 
But maybe she was leadin' me on 

[Chorus]

She took the frigidaire 
She got my favorite chair 
You could say she got the best of me 

It's like a legal crime 
But in a matter of time 
She'll be back for the rest of me
