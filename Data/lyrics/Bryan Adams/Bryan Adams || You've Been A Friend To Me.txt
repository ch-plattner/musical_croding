If you say up - I say down
We're the most unlikely pair
But up or down, high or low
You've always been right there

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me

Now if I'm feeling lowdown
Or feeling ten feet tall
Thick or thin, the shape I'm in
Don't matter to you at all

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me

Whenever I needed someone
You're right there on the line
With a friend like you, to get me through
I'll get by every time

Whenever I needed someone
You're right there on the line
With a friend like you, to get me through
I'll get by every time

You've been a friend to me, a godsend to me
I ain't too proud to say
You've been a friend to me
