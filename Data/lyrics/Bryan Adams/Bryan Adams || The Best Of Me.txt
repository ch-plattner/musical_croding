I'm looking for that perfect line
To let you know you're always on my mind
Ya this is love - n' I've learned enough to know
I'm never lettin' go
No, no, no - won't let go

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me

I may not always know what's right
But I know I want you here tonight
Gonna make this moment last for all your life
oh ya this is love - n' it really means so much
I can tell from every touch
No, no, no - can't get enough

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me

[Solo]

Ya this is love
And I've learned enough to know
I'm never letting go
No, no, no - won't let go

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always have the best of me - yeah!

When you want it - when you need it
You'll always get the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me

You've got the best of me
