I can fool myself for a night 
Goin' on 
Like I don't need you any more. 

That's like walking in the dark. 
Tel me now 
That you'll give me all your love.

Oh, give me your love give me your love 
Or nothing at all nothing at all. 
Oh, give me your love. 

I've been everywhere and here I go again 
Looking out for me and 
Leaving you behind. 

But let me hold you just one time. 
So will you give me your love, 
I'll know that you'll be mine. 

Oh, give me your love give me your love 
Or nothing at all nothing at all 
Oh, give me your love.
