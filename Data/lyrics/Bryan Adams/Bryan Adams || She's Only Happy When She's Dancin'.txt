
Monday mornin' - it's time to get up 
Two cups of coffee and she runs for the bus
Looks in the window and fixes her hair 
Nobody notices and nobody cares 

She admits it ain't no kinda life 
Workin' 9 to 5 you know... 

She's only happy when she's dancin' 
There ain't no place she'd rather be 
When she's dancin' 
Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies 

When Friday evenin' finally rolls around 
She grabs a taxi and she heads uptown 
Goes to a place they call "The Ball And Chain" 
Nothin' matters until Monday so she goes insane 

Well it's a bitch tryin' to make ends meet 
But that's the way the story goes 
She's only happy when she's dancin' 
There ain't nothin' makes her feel so free 
When she's dancin' 
The girl's outrageous and it's plain to see 

[Solo]

She ain't got much but she got independence 
Ya - she's doin' alright 
His eyes are on her as the evenin's endin'
But she ain't goin' for no mystery 
Because nobody rides for free 

She's only happy when she's dancin' 
Dancin' - there ain't no place she'd rather be 
When she's dancin' 
Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies - dancin'
