
I would walk a million miles to see ya 
I'd drive through the pouring rain
I'd dive into your deepest ocean
To still have you in my arms again.. 
I'll be there when you're feeling lonely
I'll be there til the end of time 
I'll stand beside you baby if you break down 
Ain't no mountain that I won't climb..
yeah... 

Hey little girl, come on lets..
knock on love
come into my little world, 
Coz if I touch you there,
I'll touch you here,
And all your troubles will disappear, little girl.
Come on lets.. knock on love all night long.

I would fly through any kind of weather 
I would swim across the stormy seas 
I'd rode down any river just to get to you 
I'd do anything that you please... 

Hey little girl, come on lets..
knock on love, come into my little world,
Coz if I touch you there, it'll touch you here, 
and all your troubles will disappear,little girl.. 
come on lets.. knock on love
All night long...... 

I would do anything, anything that gets you through the night!
I would give everything, 
to have you the rest of my life!
Hey little girl, come on lets.. knock on love, come into my little world,
Coz if I touch you there, it'll touch you here, 
And all your troubles will disappear, little girl..little girl
Come on lets.. knock on love 
all night long..
