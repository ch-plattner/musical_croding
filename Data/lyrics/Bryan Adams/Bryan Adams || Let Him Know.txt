Another day goes by and still you 
wonder what happened 
You'd give the world for one more try
But you're too shy to ask him 
You don't wanna ask him now 
I know your heart will pull you through 
If he means that much to you - 
you gotta let him know 

Let him know that you love him 
You gotta let him know 

What can I say it's up to you 
You gotta make up your own mind
Well it's your life it's up to you 
Cause you didn't believe me 
You still don't believe me 
Now you're gonna see it's all comin' true
That's why I'm leavin' it up to you 
Yeah you gotta let him know 

The news is out I guess you heard 
I shouldn't breathe a single word 
The bottom line is nothing's gonna stop you now 
You gotta let him know...
