
Deep down in Mississippi 
I found my sweet delta blues 
She weaved a little southern spell on me 
Made a little voodoo 

She was born the bright side of midnight 
When her mama was seventeen 
She was a hot blooded - god fearin' - gospel girl
The finest that I ever seen 

She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream 
Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream 
Black pearl - my kinda girl 
Just the kind of thing to rock my world
Black pearl - she's my kinda girl 

Met her in a dixie diner 
Put on the southern hospitality 
I can still smell her sweet molasses 
Running all over me 

We started rollin' like the river 
Like a twister tearin' through the town 
Tongue tied - satisfied - 'n southern fried 
As she drove this ol' dixie down 

She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream 
Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream 
Black pearl - my kinda girl 
Just the kind of thing to rock my world 
Black pearl - she's my kinda girl 

Yeah she's alright - yeah she's ok 
Makin' love night - she really made my day
