
I swear to you - I will always be there for you - 
there's nothin' I won't do 
I promise you - all my life I will live for you - we 
will make it through 
Forever - we will be 
Together - you and me 
Oh n' when I hold ya - nothin' can compare 
With all of my heart - ya know I'll always be - right 
there 
I believe in us - nothin' else could ever mean so much 
You're the one I trust our time has come - we're not two 
people 
Now - we are one - ya you're second to none 
Forever - we will be 
Together - a family 
The more I get to know ya - nothin' can compare 
With all of my heart - ya know I'll always be - right 
there 

Forever - we will be 
Together - just you and me
The more I get to know ya - the more I really care 
With all of my heart - ya know I'll always be... 
Ya know I really love ya - ya nothin' can compare 
For all of my life - ya know I'll always be - right 
there
