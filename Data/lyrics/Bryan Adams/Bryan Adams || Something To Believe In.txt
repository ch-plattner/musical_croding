It's funny what goes through your mind
When you think of times you spent together
Funny but when I think back why we broke up
The reasons seem so small
One day she's with me everything's fine
Sayin' somethin' sounded like I love you
The next week I see her walkin' down the street with someone else
Probably sayin' the same thing
It's doin' my brain in...

I got nothin - goin' nowhere
Tired of under achieving
I keep searchin' - nothin's workin'
It's not enough just to be breathin'
I need somethin' to believe in

It's funny what goes on in your head
When you think about the way things come together
But now I think back why things had to change
The reasons seem so small
Cruel twist of fate keepin' me awake
When I need to sleep to take away the hurtin'
But now I got time on my hands tryin' to understand
But there ain't no explainin'
It's doin' my brain in...
