
He made his way back to the old town 
And everything looked just the same 
The shops and the schools and the factories were there 
But somehow the faces had changed 

So he went for a walk in the high street 
Took his coat off and rolled up his sleeves 
He thought of his father and his father before him
And how he was the first one to leave 

Well he didn't come here for forgiveness
There isn't a lot they can say 
Cause I remember the reasons he first ran away

He's a rebel
Just a rebel 
Got his back to the wall 
Gonna fight 'til he falls 
He's a rebel 

Don't ever look back - don't surrender 
The old men say they've seen it before 
Oh they drink their beer and they talk about friends
Who didn't come back from the war 

Don't say he's too young to remember 
Don't tell him what's wrong or what's right
Just give him a chance to get out there and fight 

He's a rebel 
Just a rebel 
All the battles are won 
But he's still on the run 
He's a rebel 

When it comes time for leavin' 
Don't stand in my way 
There's nothin' left for me here 
Gonna run, run away 

In the morning he walks past the old house 
In the rain under grey northern sky 
There's a new coat of paint on the front garden gate 
But there's more there than first meets the eye 

For a moment he stands undecided 
Looking back on the days of his youth 
As two worlds collide in a moment of truth 

He's a rebel
