If ya love somebody - if ya need someone 
If ya want somebody - ya - let me be the one 
(I wanna) do to you what you do to me 
Do to you what you do to me 
Let me treat ya right - ya - show I care 
Cuz every night - I'll take ya there 
Do to you what you do to me 
Do to you what you do to me 
Don't want just anything - I just want something real
Let down your defenses baby - show me what you feel 
Do to you what you do to me 
Do to you what you do to me 
Should I stay - should I go 
There ain't no question - I already know 
(I wanna) do to you what you do to me 
(help me) do to you what you do to me 
Don't want just anything - I just want something real
Let down your defenses baby - show me what you feel
