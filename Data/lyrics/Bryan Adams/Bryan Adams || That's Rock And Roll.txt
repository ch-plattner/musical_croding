
Get up - this ain't a party til we start it
This ain't workin' til you're on your feet

I'm talkin' Buddy, I'm talkin' Elvis
You gotta shake it to the drummer's beat

That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll 
You gotta live it or you'll never know
That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll 

Do ya wanna start a revolution? 
Or do ya just wanna have some fun? 
A battered Vox and a beat up Gibson 
It's all ya need to get the job done 

That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll 
You can't change it, that's the way she goes 
That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll 

Three chords and a rockin' backbeat 
Bass and drums and you're good to go 
A Marshall stack and a '55 Fender 
If there ain't no audience there ain't no show...

That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll 
It ain't no big deal, just let it go 
That's Rock and Roll 
That's Rock and Roll
