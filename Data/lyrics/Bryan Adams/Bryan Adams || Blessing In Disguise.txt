Are you lonely - are you crying
are those teardrops in your eyes
is it more blues - is it bad news
is it a curse, or a blessing in disguise
did you leave him - do you love him
have you said your - said your last goodbyes
is it over - are you sorry
could it be a blessing in disguise
it's the scars that make you stronger
it's the hard times that make you wise
it's the sweet things only time brings
that arrive like a blessing in disguise
clouds toll by and bring the rain
tears will dry, and ease the pain
are you lonely - are you crying
are those teardrops in your eyes
is it more blues - is it bad news
is it a curse, or a blessing in disguise
