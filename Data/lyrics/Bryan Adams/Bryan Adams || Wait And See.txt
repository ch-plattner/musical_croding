
There you go looking cool, 
Writing rules 
For your theories of romance.

I know that you doubt me, 
But without me 
You'd be tearing off your one chance.

Wait and see, 
This could be the last time for me. 
Baby, just wait and see. 

All the times 
I came running back 
Down the path of the least resistance. 

I felt my body 
Was just a hobby 
For your heart's indifference. 

Wait and see, 
This could be the last time for me. 
Now baby, can't you wait and see? 
Just you wait and see. 
Just you wait and see. 
Wait and see. 

I've been trapped by your innocence, 
Haven't seen you since 
You caught me, baby. 

Shot down by the one I love, 
Now I'm taking off 
With the things you taught me.

Wait and see, 
This could be the last time for me. 
Now baby, can't you wait and see? 
Just you wait and see. 
Just you wait and see. 
Wait and see.
