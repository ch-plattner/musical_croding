Livin' on your own can be a lonely game 
A face in the crowd - no one knows your name
Itâ€™s a table for one and a broken heart to go 

She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed 
Would come to stay and never wanna leave 
But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of 
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love 

It doesn't matter who was right or wrong 
When the fire is over - when the magic's gone
You pick up the pieces and do the best you can 

It knocks you down but you try it again 
You get a little older it's a cryin' shame 
Sometimes things don't work out like you plan 

Who's gonna help when you've had enough 
It ain't no secret you're a victim of love 
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of 
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love 

One goodbye was really all it took 
Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book
But somehow all the numbers look the same 
You've been thinkin' how to get around it 
But there ain't nothin' you can do about it 
Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained 

Ain't nothin' you can't rise above 
Call it what you want but you're a victim of love

Who's gonna help you when you've had enough 
Ain't no secret you're a victim of love 

I don't wanna lose your love...
