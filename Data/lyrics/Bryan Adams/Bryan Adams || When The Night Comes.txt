
Hold on
I'll be back for you
It won't be long
But for now there's something else
That's calling me
So take me down a lonesome road
Point me east and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down
With memories

I just wanna be the one you run to
I just wanna be the one you come to
I just wanna be there for someone
When the night comes
Let's put all the cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just wanna be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

Two spirits in the night
That can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
And nothing left to fear
So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be 'round
Then you and I
We'll just roll right out of here

I just wanna be the one you run to
I just wanna be the one you come to
I just wanna be there for someone
When the night comes
Let's put all the cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just wanna be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

I know there'll be a time for you and I
Just take my hand and run away
Think of all the pieces of the shattered dream
We're gonna make it out some day
We'll be coming back
Coming back to stay
When the night comes

I wanna be the one you run to
When the night comes
To be the one you'd come to
I wanna be the one you run to
Ooh
I just wanna be the one you run to
Wanna be the one you come to
I just wanna be there for someone
When the night comes
Let's put all the cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just wanna be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes
Ah ah when the night comes
When the night rolls down
Ah ah when the night comes
I wanna be with you
Ah ah when the night comes
Oh ah when the night comes in
Ah ah oh
Ah ah when the night comes
When the night comes
Ah ah when the night comes
I wanna be right by your side
Ah ah when the night comes
Yes baby
Ah ah oh
Don't do that to me woman
Ah ah oh
Ever stayed when the night time gets in here
Ah ah when the night comes
I wanna rise and up in the
When the night comes
Ah ah when the night comes
Ah ah oh
Love me
