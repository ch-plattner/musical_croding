
We're gonna win 
Don't wanna be a loser - gonna win 
Cuz winnin' really is the only thing 
Get out of the way we're comin' in 
If ya wanna fight just step inside the ring
Does anybody wanna take a swing? 
It's gotta be all or nothing 
Oh we're gonna be the champions 
Ya we're goin' all the way - we're gonna win win

We're gonna win 
Forget about a draw - we're gonna score 
And then we're gonna get a few more 
Maybe another one just to be sure 
We'll make ya look just like an amateur 
Until the final whistle it's a war 
And then we're gonna pick ya off the floor
We wanna hear the crowd really roar 
Ya - we're comin' in we're gonna win win 

We're gonna win - we wanna win 
Cuz number one is everything 
We're gonna win - we wanna win 
We're gonna be the champions 
We're gonna win
