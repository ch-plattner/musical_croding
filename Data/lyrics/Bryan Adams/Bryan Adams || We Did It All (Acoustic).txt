
I was doin' the night shift, you were a dancer
Here and there searchin' everywhere for an answer
Two hearts are better than one - we'll never come undone

We did it all, we'd do it again in a heartbeat
You gotta go the distance right to the end
We took it all the way and in a heartbeat
We did it all and we'd do it again

You and me - there were times when we could do no wrong
Life goes by and I remember why we stayed so strong
If not for you I don't know what I would do

We did it all, we'd do it again in a heartbeat
You gotta go the distance right to the end
We took it all the way and in a heartbeat
We did it all and we'd do it again

We did it all and we'd do it again
We did it all and we'd do it again
We did it all
We did it all
We'd do it again
