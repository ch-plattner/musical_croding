
When you're losin' direction
Baby you can depend on me
For a little love and affection
You can depend on me
If ya feel brokenhearted and you just can't get started
You can depend on me
Ya know it's never easy and when you're feelin' blue
There'll be times you feel so empty
Ya sometimes I feel it too

Like sister to brother - father to mother
We live for each other - we're lover to lover
As deep as an ocean - filled with emotion
I'm forever open - can't you see
Baby you can depend on me
Depend on me - depend on me

For someone to rely on and a shoulder to cry on
You can depend on me
If you're in need of some kindness
And you can't seem to find it
You can depend on me
Well there ain't no need to worry you know we'll get along
Those dark clouds may surround you
But together we'll be strong

Like sister to brother - father to mother
We live for each other - we're lover to lover
As deep as an ocean - filled with emotion
I'm forever open - can't you see
Baby you can depend on me
Depend on me - depend on me

Your love is a guiding light
I've been watchin' it shine - shine on baby
When hard times are all around
And there's miles and miles of dirty road - depend on me
There's no need to carry that heavy load - depend on me
When hope is gone and all is lost
Just reach out - take my hand
I'll be there - I'll be your man
Depend on me
