Woke up lyin' on the floor 
Can't recall the night before 
Oh - another day 

Outside it's cold and damp 
Unemployment cheque is spent 
Yeah - another day 

Some people never know 
You can't just let it go 
Or try and work it out some other way 
Some people never learn 
My life ain't their concern 
And nothin's gonna change come what may 

Had a job but it fell through 
Landlord says the rent is due 
Oh - another day 

They say the best in life is free 
But if you don’t pay then you don’t eat 
Oh - another day 

I guess I'll never know 
You can't just let it go 
Or try to work it out some other way 

Some people never learn 
Their life ain't my concern 
Ain't nothin' gonna change come what may

Grass looks greener on the other side 
But I can't get there my hands are tied 
And if I do don't be surprised 
Oh - gotta figure it out another day
