
We waited all through the year
for the day to appear
when we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
peace on earth for everyone
and we can live forever in a world where we are free
let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
something about Christmas time
that makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
the way that the old folks smile
says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
the world would be a better place
if we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
send a message loud and clear

[Chorus:]
It's the time of year when everyone's together
we'll celebrate here on Christmas day
when the ones you love are there
you can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
something about Christmas time
that makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes
the way that the old folks smile
says that Christmas will never go away

[Repeat chorus]

Please tell me Christmas will never go away
