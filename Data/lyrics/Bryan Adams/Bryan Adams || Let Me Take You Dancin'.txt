From the edge of the city comes the sun
it makes you wanna turn your head around fills you
with desire sets both your feet on fire
how could you stand to be alone 
how could you 
stay at home so...

Let me take you dancin'
let me steal your heart tonight
let me take you dancin'
all night long

Strolling through an easy feel
through the motions that make it rock 'n real
You can learn to fake it
keep on trying 
and you're bound to make it

It's gonna turn up upside down
it's gonna spin you 'round so
Let me take you dancin'
let me steal your heart tonight
Let me take you dancin'
let me make you feel alright
