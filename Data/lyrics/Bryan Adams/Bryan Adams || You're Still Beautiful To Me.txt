Put your head on the pillow let me keep ya warm 
I wanna run my hands across your face 
Ya lyin' beside ya' still the perfect place 
We're still goin' strong 
So glad that you came along

Ya babe in every way 
You're still beautiful to me 
I just - have ta say - 
You're still beautiful to me 'n
(it's bin a long time baby) 

Lay back baby - close your eyes 
Let me do everything your heart desires 
When I think of the years makin' love to you 
There still ain't nothin' I'd rather do 
There's somethin' I can't deny 
You sure know how ta move this guy

Ya babe in every way - 
You're still beautiful to me 
I just - have ta say - 
You're still beautiful to me - can't ya see

Still feels good - still runs deep 
When you get close babe - I still get weak 
Cuz in these arms - is where you belong 
We're still goin' strong - so glad that you came along 
Hey babe you're still number one 

Oh can't ya see - you're still beautiful to me 
You'll always be so beautiful to me 
Ya babe in every way - you're still beautiful to me
