
I love the way you look tonight
With your hair hangin' down on your shoulders
N' I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango
The way you wanna do everything but talk
And how you stare at me with those "undress-me" eyes
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside

Let's make out - let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all the way
Cuz I've never touched somebody like the way I touch
your body
Now I never want to let your body go...

Let's make a night - to remember
From January - to December
Let's make love - to excite us
A memory - to ignite us
Let's make honey baby - soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin' - sweet surrender
Let's make a night - to remember - all life long

I love the way you move tonight
Beads of sweat drippin' down your skin
Me lying here - n' you lyin' there
Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere

Let's make out - let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all the way
Cuz I've never touched somebody like the way I touch
your body
Now I never want to let your body go...

Let's make a night - to remember
From January - to December
Let's make love - to excite us
A memory - to ignite us
Let's make honey baby - soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin' - sweet surrender
Let's make a night - to remember - all life long

I think about you all the time
Can't you see you drive me outta my mind
Well I'm never holdin' back again
Ya I never want this night to end
Cuz I've never touched somebody like the way I touch
your body
Now I never want to let your body go...
