
Don't give it up
Don't give it up

Don't worry if the sun don't shine
You've seen it before, you don't need to worry
Every day's an uphill climb, nothing has changed
Believe me when I tell ya

Don't give it up
Don't give it up

Don't give up--you know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Oh yeah
Don't give it up--you don't have to
Gotta do what you wanna do
Oh yeah

[whole thing repeats again]
