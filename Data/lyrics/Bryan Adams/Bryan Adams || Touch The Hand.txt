
Stand up - if ya wanna fight
I'm tellin' all the women - stand up for your rights
If ya wanna wear the trousers - you wanna act like a man
I'd love to trade ya places - love to be your thang
I'd do all the shopping - collect you favorite suit
Press all the laundry - polish all your boots
And if you brought me flowers - I'd meet you at the door
Have your dinner ready - your slippers on the floor
And when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights

Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman 
Touch the hand of the man who'll make it right
Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman
Cause when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights

Stand up - it's alright
Love to play the woman - love to play your wife
Light you favorite cigarette - pour your favorite drink
Wear your best apron - wash the dishes in the sink
Get your shaving lotion - turn the shower on
Warm up your bathrobe - keep my baby warm
Read ya bedtime stories - while you take a nap
Turn on the TV - put out the cat
But when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights..
