
I oughta be workin' - but I can't concentrate
I oughta be sleepin' - 'steada stayin' up late 
When I oughta be doing all the things I should do 
I think about you 
I oughta be writin' - but I can't find the song 
Just sittin' here driftin' - driftin' along 
There's only one thing that I wanna do 
And that's think about you 

I think about you - I can't get no rest 
I think about you - there ain't no one else
It's all I can do - I can't help myself
Ya - I think about you 

I could go cruisin' - but I've had enough 
I could go drinkin' - but I can't stand the stuff 
It just don't do me like it used ta do 
I'd rather think about you 

I think about you - I can't get no rest 
I think about you - there ain't no one else 
It's all I can do - I can't help myself 
Ya - I think about you
