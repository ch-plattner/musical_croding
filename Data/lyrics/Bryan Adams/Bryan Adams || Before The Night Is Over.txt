Hey baby I don't know what we're gonna do 
How can something wrong feels o right 
Come on baby hold on tight 

Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire 

Hey baby we're old enough to know that it's a sin 
Hey baby the door is open slide on in 
This feels too good to be true 
I'll tell ya what I want to do 

Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire 

I don't want to tell a lie 
This is something we can't hide
