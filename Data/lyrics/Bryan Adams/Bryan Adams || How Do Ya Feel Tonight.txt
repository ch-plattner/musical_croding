
is there anybody out there?
anyone that's loved in vain
anyone that feels the same

is there anybody waiting?
waiting for a chance to win
to give it up and start again

we all need something new
something that is true
and someone else to feel it too

i feel so high - no one else would know it
i don't know why i feel the way i do
i can't let got - and i'm not scared to show it
cuz being here feels right
tell me - how do you feel tonight?

is there anybody out there?
anyone that can't explain
anyone that feels no pian

is there anybody dreaming
dreaming of a better day
wehn everything goes your way

we all need something new
someting that is true
and someone else to feel it too
someone just like you
