I've been down - I've been beat
I've been so tired-that I could not speak
I've been so lost thatt I could not see
I wanted things that were out of reach
then I found you and you helped me through
and ya showed me what to do
And that's why I'm comin' back to you...

[Chorus:]
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
that's how your love will take me home back to you
And if I wish upon that star - someday I'll be where you are 
I know that day is coming soon - ya, I'm coming back to you.
You've been alone, but ya did not show it
You've been in pain, but did not know it
Let me do what I needed to - you were there when I needed you
Mighta let you down, mighta messed you round
but ya never changed your point of view
and that's why I'm comin' back to you...

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
That day is coming soon

I'm coming back to you
