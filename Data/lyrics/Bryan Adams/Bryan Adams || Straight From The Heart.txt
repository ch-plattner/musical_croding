
I could start dreamin' but it never ends 
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin' 
Straight from the heart 

You say it's easy but who's to say 
That we'd be able to keep it this way 
But it's easier 
Straight from the heart 

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start 
You know I'll never go 
As long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart

I'll see you on the street some other time 
And all our words would just fall out of line 
I was dreamin' 
Straight from the heart 

Give it to me straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make another start 
You know I'll never go 
As long as I know 
It's coming straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start 
You know I'll never go 
As long as I know 
It's coming straight from the heart
