You always say the things I can believe in
Always say the things I wanna hear
I believe them all - the stories short and tall
I believe you, ya I believe you

You give me love
When love is all I need to live
You gave your word, when words were just superlative
When I was blind, you came and opened up my eyes
Now I feel I can believe in anything
You taught me how to fly on broken wings

You always do the things I can depend on
You're always there every night and day
Everytime i've fallen down - you've always been around
To lift me up again
To set me straight again

Sometimes I find myself on my own
And can't find the road that leads me back home
But you made believe I can do anything
Even fly on broken wings
