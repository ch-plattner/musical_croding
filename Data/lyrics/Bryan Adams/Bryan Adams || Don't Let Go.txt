
I can't believe this moment's come 
It's so incredible that we're alone 
There's so much to be said and done 
It's impossible not to be overcome 
Will you forgive me if I feel this way 
Cuz we've just met - tell me that's OK 
So take this feeling'n make it grow 
Never let it - never let it go 
(Dont let go of the things you believe in) 
You give me something that I can believe in 
(Dont' let go of this moment in time) 
Go of this moment in time 
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling) 
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling 
(Dont' let go) 
No, I won't let go 

Now would you mind if I bared my soul 
If I came right out and said your'e beautiful 
Cuz there's something here I can't explain 
I feel I'm diving into driving rain 
You get my senses running wild 
I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile 
So take this feeling'n make it grow 
Never let it - never let it go 

[Chorus:]
I've been waiting all my life 
To make this moment feel so right 
The feel of you just fills the night 
So c'mon - just hold on tight
