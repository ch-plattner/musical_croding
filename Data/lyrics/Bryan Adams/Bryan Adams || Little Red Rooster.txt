
I am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow today
I am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow today
Keep everything in the farmyard
Upset in ev'ry way

The dogs begin to barkin', hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to barkin', hounds begin to howl
Watch out strange cat people
Little red rooster's on the prowl

If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
Ain't no peace in the farmyard
Since my little red rooster's been gone
