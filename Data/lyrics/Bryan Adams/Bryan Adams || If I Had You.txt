
if i was blind - you could make me see
if i was down - you could comfort me
well i ain't got a lot - but what i got is true
there's nothihg that i can't do - if i had you

i could walk on water - i could dance on air
go any place - go anywhere
could climb the empire stat - and the rockies too
there's nothihg that i can't do -if i had you

if i had you - for what else could pray?
if i had you - i could make my way
the sun is up - the sky is blue
there's nothing that i can't do - if i had you

if i had you, - for what else could i plead?
if i had you - i'd have all i need
the sun is up - the sky is blue
there's nothing that i can't do - if i had you
there's nothing that i can't do - if i had you
