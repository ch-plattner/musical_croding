
Things you said to me 
Sentimentally 
Are always on my mind. 
Seems you haunted me 
But you set me free 
Long before you gave me time to escape.

The next time 
I'll be on my way 
'Cause it's time, it's true
I'm turning my back on you. 

Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you need me 
You don't need me, 
Don't even try. 

Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you want me, 
You don't mean it, 
Don't say good-bye. 

You threw love at me 
Indispensab'ly, 
But you never could give it away.
And it seems to me 
That you'd never be, 
That's why I'll never stay with you.

You can't hold me down 
'Cause it's my life too, 
So this time it's true, 
I'm turning my back on you
. 
Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you want me, 
You don't mean it, 
Don't even try. 

Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you need me,
You don't mean it, 
Don't say good-bye. 

Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you need me, 
You don't need me, 
Don't even try. 

Don't ya say it, 
Don't say you want me, 
You don't mean it, 
Don't say good-bye.
