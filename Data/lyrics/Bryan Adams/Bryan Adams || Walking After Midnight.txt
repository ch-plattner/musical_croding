
I got out walkin' after midnight 
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do 
I'm always walkin' after midnight 
Searchin' for you 

I walk for miles along the highway 
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you 

I stop to see a weepin' willow cryin' on her pillow 
Maybe she's cryin' for me 
And as the sky turns gloomy, night winds whisper to me 
I'm lonesome as I can be 
I go out walkin' after midnight 
Out in the moonlight 
Just hopin' you may be out there a walkin' after midnight searchin' for
me 

I walk for miles along the highway 
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you
