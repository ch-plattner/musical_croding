
People say I'm the life of the party
'cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud
and hearty deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you
I need you

Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
she's just a substitute because
You're the only one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you
I need you

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Oh yeah since you put me down
My smile is my makeup
I wear since my breakup with you

Just take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
And if you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Just take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
And if you look closer, closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
