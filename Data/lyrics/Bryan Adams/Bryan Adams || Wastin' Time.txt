Lazy day you got it all to tell
Rest your weary wings come and sit a spell
And talk to me for a little while
Wastin' time, wastin' time

Yesterday as a child at play
I didn't think so hard, took it all in my stride
Wastin' time, wastin' time

People rushin' round, going nowhere fast
Talk about, oh first or last
Got one there, ain't got no class
Wastin' time, wastin' time

Lazy day you got it all to tell
Rest your weary wings come and sit a spell
And talk to me for a little while
Wastin' time, wastin' time
Wastin' time, wastin' time
Wastin' time, wastin' time
