
Some people walk the straight and narrow - some walk the rocky road
some get the silver spoon and some get the heavy load
there's a man in a paper box he smiles whenever we walk by
we just walk a little faster and say "there but for the crazy of God go I"
But a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all
i've been up and down this highway and I ain't seen a road sign yet
it's cold hard world baby you gotta hang on yo what you get
I don't believe in miracles but that don't mean they don't come true
well I may not get to heaven but I get a little closer when I'm with you
but a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all

well I get a little tired walkin' down the street
people on my side - everyone I meet
but they don't know what's on my mind
and they don't know what they might find
a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all

right when you think you don't need love is when you need it most
even if you got the father the son and the holy ghost
well there's more to truth baby than what we know is true
ya we wonder round in the darkness
but every now and then a little shines thru
and a little love - just a little love can change it all
