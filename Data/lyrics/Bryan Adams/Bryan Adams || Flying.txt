
If you ever feel like you're gonna fall - oh I'll be there
And if you ever feel down or feel small - oh don't despair
And if you ever feel lost or feel alone - babe c'mon home
Let's just make love - all night
Let's just hold on - so tight
Let's make it last - for life
I won't let you go
Ya we're flying - feels just like flying
We're such a long way up - from the ground
Just u and me flying - so high 'n I'm never gonna come down
Every time you turn around and wanna run - oh come to me
When every little dream comes undone - oh don't worry
Let's just make love - all night
Let's just hold on - so tight
Let's make it last - for life
I won't let you go
Ya we're flying so high and:
We're never gonna come down:you and me
