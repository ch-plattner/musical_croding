
I'm riding in the middle 
Halfway into you 
And halfway into something else,
I dont't know what to do. 
You said you'd make it easy, 
You said you'd take the time, 
But you call it off 
Before I change my mind.

'Cause you're not decidin' 
You're only hidin' from love. 
You can't deny it, 
You're only hidin' from love.

Well, I've been makin' changes, 
But you've been changin' too. 
You were hopin' love was somethin' else,
I was hopin' it was you. 
You said you'd make it easy, babe,
You said you'd take the time, 
But you call it off 
Before I change my mind. 

Cause you're not decidin' 
You're only hidin' from love. 
You can't deny it, 
You're only hidin' from love.

I know you're tryin', 
But you're only hidin' from love. 
You say you're shy, 
But you're only hidin' from love.
