[Bryan:] I finally found someone, who knocks me off my feet;
[Bryan:] I finally found the one who makes me feel complete...
[Barbara:] It started over coffee, we started out as friends;
[Barbara:] It's funny how from simple things; the best things begin...
[Bryan:] This time is different;
[Barbara:] la la la la
[Bryan:] It's all because of you!..
[Bryan:] It's better than it's ever been;
[Together:] Cuz we can talk it through;
[Barbara:] My favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?";
[Barbara:] It's all you had to say...
[Together:] To take my breath away... 

[Together:] This is it!
[Together:] Oh, I finally found someone; Someone to share my life;
[Together:] I finally found the one - to be with every night;
[Barbara:] Cause whatever I do
[Bryan:] It's just got to be you!
[Together:] My life has just begun, I finally found someone... 

[Bryan:] Did I keep you waiting?
[Barbara:] I didn't mind
[Bryan:] I apologize
[Barbara:] Baby, that's fine
[Bryan:] I would wait forever
[Together:] Just to know you were mine;
[Bryan:] Ya Know - I love your hair...
[Barbara:] Are you sure it looks right?
[Bryan:] I love what you wear...
[Barbara:] Isn't it too tight?
[Bryan:] You're exceptional!
[Together:] I can't wait for the rest of my life... 

[Together:] Oh This Is It!
[Together:] I finally found someone; Someone to share my life,
[Together:] I finally found the one; to be with every night...
[Barbara:] Cause whatever I do
[Bryan:] It's just got to be you
[Together:] My life has just begun; I finally found someone...
[Barbara:] And whatever I do.
[Bryan:] It's just got to be you!
[Barbara:] My life has just begun...
[Together:] I finally found someone...
