You said you always keep me happy
You said you always be true
You said you always keep me warm at night
I didn't know that there'll be someone else there too

But I still miss you... a little bit
Don't mind me, I'll get over it
Learn to live, live to love another day
I'll be my ownself in a week or two
Until then I'll be sad and blue
Yes I admit, I still miss you... a little bit

You said you always be my lover
You said you'll be with me till the end
You said we'll always be together
I wasn't count on you sleeping with my friend

Yeah I still miss you... a little bit
Don't mind me, I'll get over it
Learn to live, live to love another day
I'll be my ownself in a week or two
Until then I'll be sad and blue
Yes I admit, I still miss you... a little bit

I still miss ya... a little bit
