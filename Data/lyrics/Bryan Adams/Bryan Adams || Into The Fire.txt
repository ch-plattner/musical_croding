
Life - thin as a thread 
Sometimes you're lucky 
Sometimes you're better off dead 

Your first breath is taken and in to the world you are cast 
You long for tomorrow while living each day as your last 

Well I know what your heart desires 
But you can't take it with you 
Into the fire 

Now you've done all you can 
Your life's at the crossroads 
You watch as it slips through your hands 

So stand on the mountain and shout in vain at the sky 
But nobody hears you - the words only echo inside 
Oh shelter the flame - it may expire 
Risin' up from the ashes 
Into the fire 

Just hold on to your life down to the wire 
Oh out from the dragon's jaws 
Into the fire 

There's a moment in every man's life 
When he must decide what is wrong and what's right 

You could wait for your dreams to come true 
But time has no mercy 
Time won't stand still for you 

Well I know what your heart desires 
Crawlin' out from the wreckage 
Into the fire 

Here I go...into the fire 
I know...what your heart desires
