Hey Elvis won't cha come back home
I left a message on your code-a-phone 
I tried to reach ya but I can't get through 
Hey Elvis where the hell are you? 
Somebody saw you at the shopping mall
Somebody said they heard that Southern draw
Hey Elvis is it really true 
We're all waitin' for a sign from you
Everybody knows about your pink Cadilac
Everybody's wonderin' when you're comin' back
Everbody's waitin' just to hear ya sing 
Hey Elvis, You're still the king 
Hey Elvis won't cha come back soon
Nobody's rockin' in the jungle room 
Come December don't know what we'll do
Be a blue Christmas without you 
Everybody knows about your pink Cadilac 
Everybody's wonderin' when you're comin' back
Everbody's waitin' just to hear ya sing 
Hey Elvis, You're still the king

Love Me Tender - Don't Be Cruel 
Return To Sender - Stuck On You 
It's Now Or Never - Suspicious Minds 
Hey Elvis aren't ya lonesome tonight 
Hey Elvis can't ya see 
They need you back in Memphis, Tennessee
They're makin' records but there's nothin' new 
Nobody ever done it quite like you

Everybody knows about your pink Cadilac 
Everybody's wonderin' when you're comin' back 
Everbody's waitin' just to hear ya sing 
Hey Elvis, You're still the king 
Everybody knows about your Lisa Marie
Everybody knows about TCB 
Everybody's waitin' just to hear ya sing come back to Memphis, 
Elvis - you're still the King
