
Pardon me, 
Have you got the time 
To let me say hello. 
Couldn't help but see 
That you look like a lady I used to know 
A long time ago. 

Remember the time we spent together. 
Remember the days I dreamt forever. 
Remember the nights we stayed together. 
Whatever I do I still remember. 

It's hard to believe
That I held her up 
And then she let me down. 
Someone's sayin' to me 
That she broke my heart and left me
Spinnin' round and round and round. 

Remember the time we spent together. 
Remember the days I dreamt forever. 
Remember the nights we stayed together. 
Whatever I do I still remember.
