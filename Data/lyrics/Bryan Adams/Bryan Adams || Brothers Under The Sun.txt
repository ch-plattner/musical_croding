I had a dream - of the wide open prairie 
I had a dream - of the pale morning sky 
I had a dream - that we flew on golden wings 
And we were the same - just the same - you and I 
Follow your heart - little child of the west wind 
Follow the voice - that's calling you home 
Follow your dreams - but always, remember me 
I am your brother - under the sun 

We are like birds of a feather 
We are two hearts joined together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun 

Wherever you hear - the wind in the canyon 
Wherever you see - the buffalo run 
Wherever you go - I'll be there beside you 
Cos you are my brother - my brother under the sun
