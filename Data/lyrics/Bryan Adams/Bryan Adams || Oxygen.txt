My hands are shakin' - my heart skips a beat
I can't focus - I can't speak
It's like i'm underwater
And i'm going deep - I need ya around me

Oxygen - every moment
Oxygen - everyday
I can't live without it - don't take it away
I need to breath you in - like oxygen

Losin' cohesion - I'm losin' my mind
I'm tryin' to resist it - to stay out of the light
It's like I'm drownin' - in the deepest sea
I need ya around me

Oxygen - every moment
Oxygen - everyday
I can't live without it no - don't take it away
I need to breath you in

Oxygen every moment - oxygen everyday
I can't live without it - don't take it away
I need to breath you in - over and over again

My pulse racin' - my heads in a spin
I need to see you darlin' - cuz you're my oxygen
