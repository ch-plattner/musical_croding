
You ask me if there will come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love, never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose it's desire for you
Never my love, never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my
Whole life depends on you (on you)

Never my love, never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never my love 
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend
Your whole life with me 

Never my love, never my love

Never my love, never my love

You ask me if there will come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love, never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose it's desire for you
Never my love, never my love

Never my love, never never never my love
