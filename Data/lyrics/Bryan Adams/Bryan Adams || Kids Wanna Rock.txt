Turned on the radio 
Sounded like a disco 
Musta turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find no rock 'n roll 

This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off 
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock 
London to L.A. 
Talkin' 'bout the New Wave
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut
And waste your life away 

Around the world or around the block 
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock 
Get me my D.J. 
I got somethin' he's gotta play 
Wanna hear it I can't wait 
So turn it up, turn it up... 

Kick down the barricades 
Listen what the kids say 
From time to time people change their minds
But the music is here to stay 

I've seen it all from the bottom to the top 
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock 

Around the world or around the block 
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock 

Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock
