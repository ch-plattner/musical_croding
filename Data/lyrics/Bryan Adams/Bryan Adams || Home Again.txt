
When I was younger 
My life was torn asunder 
And I was carried far away 

Now somewhere in the distance 
I feel a strange insistance 
I long to be there once again 

The day is drawing nearer 
The time has come to leave here
The feeling just keeps gettin' stronger every day

So I pray for the moment when I'll be with you 
And all that we hoped for is all comin' true 
When the time we've spent waitin' is finally through 
I'll be home again 

I can still remember 
Days that never ended 
Standin' on a distant shore 

With every raindrop fallin' 
I hear the thunder callin' 
Like so many times before 

Sometimes in the darkness 
I hear what my heart says 
Maybe one day I'll know what that feelings for 

So I wait for the moment when I'll be with you 
And all that we hoped for is all comin' true
The time we've spent waitin' is finally through 
I'll be home again 

When you're out there on your own 
It can chill you to the bone 
There's a cold wind blowin' 
But it feels good knowin' 
The worst is over now - I'm finally goin' home 

It's gettin' stronger 
Can't wait any longer
