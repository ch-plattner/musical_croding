
Well you think that you can take me on 
You must be crazy 
There ain't a single thing you've done 
That's gonna phase me 
Oh, but if you want to have a go 
I just want to let you know 
Get off my back and into my game 
Get out of my way and out of my brain 
Get outta my face or give it you best shot 
I think it's time you better face the fact 
Get off my back 

You know it's all just a game that I'm playing 
Don't think that you can't find a way in 
That's what I'm saying 
Oh if you want to have a go 
I just want to let you know...
