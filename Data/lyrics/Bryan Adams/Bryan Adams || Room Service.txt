When a hotel room's the closest thing you got to home
You could be in Philadelphia you could even be in Rome
You gotta dial nine to get an outside line
I even need a concierge just to take a drive - it's a crazy life
I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong
It's a different melody but the same old song...
Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life
Been around the world 'bout a thousand times
Still a knock on the door makes me nervous
I think I'll see you standing there - but no
It's only room service - ya room service
I've been living out my suitcase as long as I remember
Life's the same - it doesn't change - it's a gibson or a fender
I still think about you babe - I swear sometimes I see your face
These are crazy days
Ya I think I hear your voice - but it's just a dream
It's a brand new movie but the same old scene
Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life
Been around the world 'bout a thousand times
Still a knock on the door makes me nervous
I think I'll see you standing there - but no
It's only room service - ya room service
Ya know I wouldn't change a thing - no
I'm just waiting for the bell in room to ring
I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong
It's a different melody but the same old song...
