all i want is a real fast car
i wanna go too fast - i wanna go too far
i wanna take a bite of this sweet sweet life
while the gettin' is good and the time right
i wanna fill my cup - i wanna drink it up.

i don't wanna live forever
i just wanna go for broke
gonna ride thru any kind of weather
go out in a cloud of smoke
i don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever
don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever

all i need is a good excuse
you can cut my reins and turn me loose
i'm gonna pull my weight i'm gonna push my luck
i'm gonna go down fightin' when my time is up
you know i don't care - i'm gonna get my share.

i don't wanna live forever
i just wanna go for broke
gonna ride thru any kind of weather
go out in a cloud of smoke
i don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever
don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever

i wanna fill my cup - i wanna drink it up
ya - i don't care i wanna get my share

i don't wanna live forever...
