hey baby you oughta be free
you gotta get out and chase all your dreams
there ain't no point in you waiting for me
hey baby you oughta be free

hey baby it's gonna be fine
you goin' your way and me goin' mine
we'll be together somewhere down the line
hey baby it's gonna be fine

hey baby - you got to give it a try
hey baby - spread out your wings and just fly
hey baby - you know that i'm on your side
hey baby - you better take care

harden your heart cause it's lonely out there
it won't be easy and it won't be fair
hey baby you better take care

hey baby - you got to give it a try
hey baby - spread out your wings and just fly
hey baby - you know that i'm on your side

hey baby you gotta be strong
you've had this feeling inside all along
you can only deny yourself for so long
hey baby you gotta be strong
