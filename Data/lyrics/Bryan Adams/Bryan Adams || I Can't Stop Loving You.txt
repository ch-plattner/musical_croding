
I can't stop loving you I've made up my mind
To live in memories of a lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I just going live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
They say the time will heal a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you I've made up my mind
To live in memories of a lonesome time

And they say the time will heal a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop loving but it's useless to say
So I just, I'm just living my life in dreams of yesterday
Yeah, I just going live my life in dreams of yesterday
