
Call me in the nighte babe
call me in the day
don't say I'm getting older
changed in every way
don't turn me away

Close me like a book babe
when I'm old and grey.
Knockin' on your door I'm feelin' all fustrate
don't turn me away
oh - don't turn me away

Don't turn me away babe
Don't turn me away 
Don't turn me away babe
Don't turn me away

Oh - don't turn me away
Oh - don't turn me away

Waitin' just to see you
crazy for your smile
though I'm feelin' longer 
- take me for a while
so don't turn me away
oh - don't turn me away
oh - don't turn me away
