
I don't look good in no Armani Suits 
No Gucci shoes - or designer boots 
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z 
But there's just one thing that looks good on me 

The only thing I want 
The only thing I need 
The only thing I choose 
The only thing that looks good on me...is you 

I'm not satisfied with Versace style 
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file 
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good 
But there's only one thing that fits me like it should 

The only thing I want 
The only thing I need 
The only thing I choose 
The only thing that looks good on me...is you 

Ya it's you - it could only be you 
Nobody else will ever do 
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to 
Ya we stick like glue 

The only thing I want 
The only thing I need 
The only thing I choose 
The only thing that looks good on me...is you
