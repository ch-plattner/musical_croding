
Here I am - this is me 
There's no where else on earth I'd rather be 
Here I am - it's just me and you 
And tonight we make our dreams come true 

It's a new world - it's a new start 
It's alive with the beating of young hearts 
It's a new day - it's a new plan 
I've been waiting for you 
Here I am 

Here we are - we've just begun 
And after all this time - our time has come 
Ya here we are - still goin' strong 
Right here in the place where we belong 

[Chorus]
Here I am - next to you 
And suddenly the world is all brand new 
Here I am - where I'm gonna stay 
Now there's nothin standin in our way 
Here I am - this is me
