
I take the night train
I take an airplane
Cause you belong to me
I just wanna say
Ain't gonna let you get away

I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you tonight

You say you ain't leaving
Can't help dreaming
You belong to me
I'll take that highway
I take the low way
No, you belong to me

I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you tonight

I'm not drinking
It gets me thinking
You belong to me
While you're out there
Remember, I'm right here
And you belong to me

I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you
Come on, let me hold you
Tonight
