
Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans
And I'm really gonna spend it right
Well, I been doin' my homework all week long
Now the house is empty and my folks are gone
C'mon everybody

Well my baby's number one
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house will be a-shakin'
From the bare feet a-slappin' on the floor
Well when you hear the music you just can't sit still
If your brother won't rock, then your sister will
C'mon everybody! C'mon everybody!
C'mon! C'mon!

Hell we'll really have a party
But we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home, I'm afraid they gonna have my hide
There'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more running 'round with the usual crew
Who cares?
C'mon everybody ... c'mon everybody! 
C'mon everybody ... c'mon everybody!
