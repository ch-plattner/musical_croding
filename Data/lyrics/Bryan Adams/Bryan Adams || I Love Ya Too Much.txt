
Every morning when I wake up
You put the sugar in my coffee cup
I try to get to work - try to be on time
But you've got something else on your mind

Well I think I might be breakin'
From all the love we're makin'
You drive me crazy - I can't get enuff
I can't help it - I love ya too much

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
I love ya too much

The guys at work, they say I'm whipped
They think I'm crazy - think I lost my grip
But they're just jealous - that's alright
Cuz they don't get your lovin' at night

I know how crazy it's sounding
I can't stop my heart from pounding
I'm in a hurry, baby - I'm in a rush
I just can't help it - I love ya too much

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
I love ya too much

The doctor says I'll have a heart attack
If you keep wearing me out like that
He tells me I'm a real bad case
Well he'd be dead if he were in my place

I guess it aint surprisin'
Ya got my temperature risin'
You're my lover, baby - you're my crush
I can't help it - I love ya too much

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
I love ya too much
