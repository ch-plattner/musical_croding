
Well I hardly knew ya baby 
And you were comin' on 
Mama told me there'd be days like these 
I shoulda known better maybe 
Woulda seen right through ya 
I needed you like a disease 

I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're a mystery 
I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're history - history 

You said you'd wait forever 
But I know your type 
The lights are on but no-one's home 

I changed my number maybe 
You better change your mind 
Cause I'd rather spend the night alone 

I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're a mystery 
I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're history - history 

I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're a misery 
I ain't gonna cry over you 
You're history 

I ain't your kinda guy
So forget about me 
Cause I ain't too shy to say what I'm thinkin' - hit it 

I got reckless baby 
Put you in your place 
Next time maybe re-arrange your face 
[Chorus]
