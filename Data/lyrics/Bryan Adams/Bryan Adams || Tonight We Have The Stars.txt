
We'll save ourselves a bottle
Of California red
We'll drink it on a Tuesday
Let it go straight to our heads

And we'll eat from good china
And make love on linen sheets
Just like there's no tomorrow
No surrender, no retreat

I can feel it in my bones
And I know it in my heart
Tomorrow may be rainin' but tonight we have the stars
We may always be together
Or miles and miles apart
Tomorrow may be rainin' but tonight we have the stars

We were young and we were foolish
We were easy to deceive
Said we'd be in love forever
And it was easy to believe

Well you and I we had our moments
Our devils and our doubts
But the time we spend together
We gotta make it count

[Chorus]

So let's hold on to this moment
Cause it's all we've really got
