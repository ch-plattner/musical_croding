It ain't a party - if you can't come 'round 
You can drive the car - I'll play my ol' guitar 
Come back to me - come back to me 
Ya we can get some beer - ya let's get outta here
Come back to me - come back to me 
We'll find a place to go - no one will ever know 
Somewhere that's outta town 
Put a blanket on the ground - baby
N' we can really go crazy 
Babe it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round 
Can't even get started - if you don't come down 
Even Saturday - ain't a holiday - if you stay away 
No - no it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round 

Slip into somethin' tight - we'll slip into the night 
Come back to me - come back to me 
We'll see the sun go down - 'n maybe fool around 
Come back to me - come back to me 
Ya we can start a fire - maybe get a little higher 
Don't worry what to bring - cuz we got everything - baby
And we can really go crazy 

Babe it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round 
Can't even get started - if you don't come down 
Even Saturday - ain't a holiday - if you stay away 
No - no it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round
