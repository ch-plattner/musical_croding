
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 
I needed the money 'cause I had none 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 

I miss my baby and I feel so bad 
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl I've ever had 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 

Robin' people with a six gun 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 

I miss my baby and I feel so bad 
I guess my race is run 
She's the best girl I've ever had 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won
