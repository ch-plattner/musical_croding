Well I made up my mind 
Not gonna let you get away 
To think that I'm the lucky guy 
I've almost got it made 

Cause it's been so long
Since I've felt so strong 
About anyone at all 
I get so excited 
I ain't gonna fight it 
I think I might be fallin' in love 

So come on - let's get it right 
Cause you're the only one 
So come on - we ain't got all night 
Cause you're the only one 

Last night 
I thought you mighta stayed 
If I'd a' had the guts 
I woulda pushed my luck 
But then you mighta turned away 

How do I explain 
I know it sounds insane 
But then I've been through this before
In just a matter of time 
You could change your mind
You could turn and walk right hrough that door

So come on - let's get it straight 
Cause you're the only one 
So come on - I just can't wait 
Cause you're the only one
