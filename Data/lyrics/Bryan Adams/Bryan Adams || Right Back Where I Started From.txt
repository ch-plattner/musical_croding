You don't know what you got - until you lose it
And I can testify that that's the truth
I had it all and didn't know how to use it
I was so stupid - it was right before my eyes
I've been looking all my life
Waiting for the perfect time
Never knew that I would find it
Right back where I started from
Why'd I have to go so far
When everything was where you are
How'd I know that you be waiting
Right back where I started from
Who can tell ya where the rivers flowin'
Just ride the wave - let it take ya down
All the twists and turns I navigated
It's so frustratin' you were there all the time
I've been looking all my life
Waiting for the perfect time
Never knew that I would find it
Right back where I started from
Why'd I have to go so far
When everything was where you are
How'd I know that you be waiting
Right back where I started from...oh where I started from
I know where I'm headed to - it's right back where I've been
