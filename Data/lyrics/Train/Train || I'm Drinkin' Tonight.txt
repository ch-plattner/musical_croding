I've been walking straight too long
On a thin sharp line, fading, almost gone
Feeling my shadow get close, even it knows there's a hard rain comin' on

AAAH

I'm drinkin' tonight
Gonna give up the fight
The only thing stronger than you is whiskey

AAAH

I'm lovin' you in
The ghost of my sin
And the taste of goodbye on your lips when you kissed me
'til I can't take anymore
Poison's a cure

To hell with your memory, gonna burn it down
I choke back tears 'til I damn near drown
What do you do with a man
With dirt on his hands and a deep hole dug in the ground

AAAH

I'm drinkin' tonight
Gonna give up the fight
The only thing stronger than you is whiskey

AAAH

I'm lovin' you in
The ghost of my sin
And the taste of goodbye on your lips when you kissed me
'til I can't take anymore
Poison's a cure

I'm chasing my demons with a shot of Crown
Let 'em all have their way
'til I see the light of day

But tonight

I'm drinkin' tonight
Gonna give up the fight
The only thing stronger than you is whiskey

AAAH

I'm lovin' you in
The ghost of my sin
And the taste of goodbye on your lips when you kissed me
I can't take anymore
I hope the poison's a cure
I can't take anymore
I hope the poison's a cure
