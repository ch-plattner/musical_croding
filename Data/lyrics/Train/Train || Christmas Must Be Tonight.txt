Come down to the manger, see the little stranger
Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the prince of peace
The wheels start turning, torches start burning
And the whole wise men journey from the east

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

A shepherd on the hillside, went over my flock I bide
On a cold winter night, a band of Angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice say, "Fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born King"

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies
Why a simple herdsmen such as I
And then it came to pass, he was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Be tonight, be tonight
Be tonight, be tonight
Be tonight, be tonight
