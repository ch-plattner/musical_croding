
Home all night, nothing's wrong
It's just my nature's got me holding on too tight
So you say you're on the way
Got me feeling like I should be holding on this time
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah yeah...
Oh my, step and slide
Hope they're gonna make you feel like someday I will, I know
Cause every girl I know has to go out to dance
Before my butterfly has its chance to fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
And I know that I'll fall in too deep
You'll wait till I fall asleep before you fade away.. fade away
And I know that it won't take too long
Before you go and find something wrong, and fade away.. fade away
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah
Oh, you? What you do?
Seems you got me feeling like you want me to
Feel..
But it's alright, how we'll be
Nothing that you want from me
Fade...
I know that I'll fall in too deep
You'll wait till I fall asleep before you fade away.. fade away..
And I know that it won't take too long
Before you go and find something wrong and fade away... fade away
And I know that I'll fall in too deep
You'll wait till I fall asleep before you fade away... fade away...
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah..
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah...
I'm heavy on... I'm heavy on... I'm heavy on my knees... yeah...
