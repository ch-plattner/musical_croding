
I remember when every other day was bad
You were my brother, so tall was all you had
Sireno was dead but we had you instead
Now I remember our precious petting zoo
Our delicate high school and all the things we said we'd do

They all fall like, Sweet Rain
Wet my memory, Sweet Rain
Come on down on me

It wasn't hard to look ahead
You wanted to be me instead
I wanted to be you instead but
I fell and you fell back
What is wrong with me, well what is wrong with you, Jack?

Everybody knew she was coming, Everybody knew she was
Sweet rain, wet my memory, sweet rain, fall down on me

The big screen got in between, what it was and what we've seen
How have you been? What have you been? I think about you
Now and again, I think about you every single day
Well, shit I'm thinking about you now

Sweet Rain, Wet my memory
Sweet Rain, Fall down on me
