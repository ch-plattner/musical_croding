
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me
Spends her light on the Bayou
But she don't come to see
She's the one that makes my dreams
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me 

The shape of her horizon
Makes the morning sun
When she puts her eyes on
Each and anyone
She's the one that makes me fall
Midnight moon shines through it all 

She's the one that makes me fall
Midnight moon shines through it all
She's the one that makes my dreams
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me
