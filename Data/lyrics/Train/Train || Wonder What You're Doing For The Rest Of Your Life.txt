
That Big Apple took a bite out of me
Never the same after living in the city
You've got to tell yourself things are all true
You've got to tell yourself you can do, you can do

Now, now when I met you
How, how can I let you into all my love, so into your love
Bet you're probably crazy, that I'm being sold
Bet you're probably perfect for me, bet you're made of gold

I think I want to tell you everything
I think I want to give it all tonight
I think I want to tell you everything
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're
I wonder what you're, I wonder what you're
I wonder what you're

On the East Coast people are regal
On the West Coast Mary Jane is legal
I had to tell myself the tide was going to turn
I had to sell myself to people who burn it

Now, now if I let you
How, how can I get you try to understand, I was a different man
Maybe I am crazy, maybe I should fold
Maybe I am perfect for you, baby I'm sold

I think I want to tell you everything
I think I want to give it all tonight
I think I want to tell you everything
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're
I wonder what you're, for the rest of your life

All them girls from Harlem to Wall Street
That Big Apple took a bite out of me, yeah
Crushed dreams from Chelsea to Queens
That Big Apple took a bite out of me

Now, now if I let you
How, how can I get you try to understand, I was a different man

I think I want to tell you everything
I think I want to give it all tonight
I think I want to tell you everything
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life
I wonder what you're
I wonder what you're, for the rest of your life
