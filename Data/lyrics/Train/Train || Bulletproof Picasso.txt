
Am I made of paper?
Cause I tear so easily
Am I made of vapor?
Because I disappear
Do I have to have a reason
For anything I feel
Just be glad I'm real
Glad I'm real
Am I real?

Are you made of lead paint?
A bulletproof Picasso
All the virgin saints
Put you here to care for me
I don't need a reason
For anything I feel
Just be glad I say what I mean
And mean what I say to you

We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll that top down, hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I got you, and you got me tonight

(Cause I got you, and you got me tonight)

Did you ever see the waves break
Into a million pieces
Or stay awake
With someone who was dying
You don't need to tell me
Anything at all
I'm just glad you're here
Glad you're real
Are you real?

Am I made of timber?
Cause I'm on fire
Will you remember
Tonight for very long
You don't need to sell me
On anything at all
Just say what you mean
And mean what you say to me

We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll that top down, hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I got you, and you got me tonight

Amber waves of grain
Fly by highway lanes
Waited for this change
Seems like my entire life
If only the good die young
We'll outlast everyone
For some of the things we've done
And we've just begun

We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll that top down, hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I got you, and you got me tonight

Woah-oh oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

You got me tonight
You got me tonight
You got me
Tonight
