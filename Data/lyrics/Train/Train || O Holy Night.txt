
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
Holy night divine!

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from a distant land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
Holy night divine!
