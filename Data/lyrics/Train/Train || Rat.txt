
Not too smart, just out of school
A teacher's pet and modern fool
Talked about being a freelance broker
But the police caught him tryin' to choke her
Can't describe him in his corner
Like a rat out of the water
Out of work and outta grass
Mother Mary, never seems to stop to talk, she just walk on past
Down Down, no information one day always away
But why why, can't I see you
One day always away
Why why can't I be you
One day always away
He's outta school now, just another taken barstool
and this neighborhood ain't what he had in mind
wants to be your girlfriend, love to be your boyfriend
wants to be your telephone, wants to wants to be your man
But why why, can't I see you
One day always away
Why why can't I be you
One day always away
Down Down, no information
