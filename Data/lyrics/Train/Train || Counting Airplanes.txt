I put ketchup on my scrambled eggs
And everybody thinks it's funny
I don't get mad
I don't laugh cause you don't shave your legs
But everybody thinks it's funny 

No need to get mad
I don't spend my time with anyone
Who doesn't think I'm wonderful
Or somewhat cash refundable at times 

Now I'm out here counting airplanes
Trying to make sense of the change
And I don't wanna be just anybody
So don't try to figure me out
I won't try to figure you out 

I don't wanna be some average anybody
Now I got friends that ride into the storm
And ride out of the storm with nothing
They rode into the storm with 

And there seems to be a price for everything
You get what you pay for then you pay for
What you already thought you bought before 

When you're up between the new sky line
The city lights and the warm sunshine
It's a long way down
When you can count on one hand what you love
And can count on who you love to help you on your long way down

You end up counting airplanes
Trying to keep up with these changes
I don't wanna be with anybody else
So don't try to figure me out
I won't try to figure you out
I don't wanna be some average anybody
