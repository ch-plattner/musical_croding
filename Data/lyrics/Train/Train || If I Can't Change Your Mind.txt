
Tears fill up my eyes
I'm washed away with sorrow
And somewhere in my mind
I know there's no tomorrow

I see that you're leaving soon
I guess you've had your fill
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will

And all throughout all the years
I've never strayed from you my dear
You suspect I'm somewhere else
You're feeling sorry for yourself

Leaving with a broken heart
I love you even still
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will
If I can't change your mind

Even though my heart keeps breaking
Don't you know that I'll be waiting here for you
I hope you see I'm dedicated
Look how long that I have waited
If you come back you will find a different person
If you change your mind

How can I explain away somethin' I haven't done
And if you cant trust in me now, you'll never trust in anyone
With all the crazy doubts you've got
I love you even still
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will
If I can't change your mind
If I can't change your mind
Wish I could change your mind
