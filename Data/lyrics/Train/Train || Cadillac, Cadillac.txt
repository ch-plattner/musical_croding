Cadillac, Cadillac take me home
I would rather sit there all alone
Than watch you run around this dancefloor light
With everybody but me it just ain't right
Cadillac, Cadillac take me home
I'd rather play games on my G4 phone
Than watch you flirt at the bar all damn night
With everybody but me girl it just ain't right

Right what you do 
To a man falling all over you
Right, Right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I, Do what I can
But when it comes to women I don't understand
So I, I'm out of here
Call yourself a cab watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey Baby

Cadillac, Bernie Mac's on the tube
Think I'm gonna spend my night with you
She wouldn't know a good thing like I said
If it hit her from behind upside the head
Cadillac, do I lack what it takes?
Every time I love seems my heart breaks
I'd rather sit online stare in cyberspace
Than lose another part of me to another pretty face

Right what you do 
To a man falling all over you
Right, Right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I do what I can, 
But when it comes to women I don't understand
Now I, I'm outta here
Call yourself a cab watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey Baby
I'll be alright now now baby
Hey Baby

Right, Right what you do 
To a man falling all over you
Right, Right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I do what I can
But when it comes to women I don't understand
So I, I'm outta here
Call yourself a cab watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey Baby
Be alright now now baby 
Hey Baby
I'll be alright now now baby
