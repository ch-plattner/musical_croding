
We walked down the street as the snow started falling
Stamping our feet all the taxi cab crawling
You said I m so cold I can't remember my name
And I said the same

He took her photo and said he adored her
In New York martini it literally floored her
And we played Miss America over again
And again and again,

Oh, the light was a New York Christmas baby
Oh, it was the way it should be done
Oh, we saw the sights, tinsel and lights
Looking down the barrel of a gun

The winters gone warmer than last years got colder
And we all have some things about how the time goes
That we rather not know
Oh, the light was a New York Christmas baby
Snowflakes like diamonds in her hair
And we watched them all, sparkle and fall
Something almost true was in the air
Yeah that, was a New York Christmas baby
Yeah that, was the way it was back then
Oh we saw the sights, tinsel and lights
You kissed in the snow and that was when
I feel in love with Christmas once again.
