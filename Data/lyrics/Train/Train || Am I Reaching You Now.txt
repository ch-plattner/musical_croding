
Would you believe me
If I said My head is spinning without you
Would you believe me 
If I just want to let you know how I feel about you

Now I want to know what I can do to make you stay with me tonight
'Cause I do
Would you believe me if I leave you, cause here I go

Am I reaching you now
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed now that you've started, I'm going to finish it

Would you believe me
If I held on too tight to make it without you
Would you believe me
If I just gotta let you know I cant live without you
Would you believe me if I leave you cause here I go

Am I reaching you now
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed, now that you've started it, I'm going to finish it

Now I don't mean to test your faith
Or make you think that I wont wait for you
'Cause I will
But baby this is all I got
So I'm gonna give it one last shot
I would give you more than enough
But baby I got to let go
Let you go

Would you believe me
Am I reaching you now
I was trying to tell you I was letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm going to finish it

(am I reaching you now)
Gotta finish it
Gotta finish it
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm gonna finish it
