You live so close to the end
Texas, are you my friend? 
'Cause I'm afraid of you
Hey, Maine, hey, you're a little too high for me
And Fla, you're just a little too low
D.C., you could be the end of me
I think I'm movin' to Idaho
I ain't afraid of you

Oh, people on the outside lookin' in
Mother Nature shakes, what then, what then?
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through
she'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do

Oh, oh, Carolina Brothers you make me crawl under the covers
I just can't get myself to go, oh no
Hey, Joe, I see your name too, but there is nothin' that they can do
I think I'm movin' to Idaho
I ain't afraid of you

Oh, people on the outside lookin' in
Mother Nature shakes, what then, what then?
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through
she'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do
