Teach me to fall
And I'll teach you to sing
When life keeps stealing your melody
Around your finger I'll be a string
I will forget everything I know
About love, I don't know, about love
Sure feels good at first

I'll learn to dance if you promise not to laugh
And I end up in a cast
From falling over
And you can't get mad when some girl you think I have
Puts a story in your head
When I hardly know her so
About love, I don't know, about love
Sure feels good at first

Ooh, every spring there's a honey bee that stings
So things can change
Ooh, every fire get too close and it reminds you
Things can change in love
But it sure feels good at first

For every heartbreak, there's a sermon to be said
And this pastor in my hands preaching to the choir
Don't get me wrong cause it's too soon to decide
But this ain't my first rodeo when my heart's been roped and tied
In love, I don't know, about love
But it sure feels good at first

Ooh, every autumn colors come, that you've forgotten
So things can change
Ooh every frost some live on and some are lost
So things can change in love
But it sure feels good at first

Na na na na na, mmmmmm
Na na na na na, mmmmmm

But it sure felt good at first
