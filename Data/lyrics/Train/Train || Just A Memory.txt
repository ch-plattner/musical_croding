Come back, come back, come back baby

School bells, wishing wells, sun burns, long turns
DUI's, fake IDs, first kiss to the Fugees
Breaking in, breaking out
The man on the radio knew what we were thinking about
When we didn't even know what we were drinking about
Wedding bells, nursery rhymes
Thrift shops and Five and Dimes
Move home, quit the life
Wasn't ready for the nine to five
Breaking up, breaking down
The girl at the bank, she knew what we were fighting about
When we didn't even know what I was writing about

Love I guess, is there anything else?

Come back, come back, high or low
Before you're just a girl I used to know
And who will melt with me
When I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory
Come back, come back, come back baby
For I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory

Sunshines, intervention, roads paved with good intentions
Birthdays, condolences, on the wagon or so she says
Play the game, the papers came, no one wins, nobody to blame
Everybody's right, but no one's wrong
But where have all the good times gone?
Lawyers ask me if I wanted war
And I don't remember what I was fighting for, no

Love I guess, is there anything else?

Come back, come back, high or low
Before you're just a girl I used to know
And who will melt with me
When I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory
Come back, come back, come back baby
For I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory

No I'm dying to let you know
Every time you leave it kills me slowly
If you go now it'll be the last time
I'm sailing away on these tears that I'm crying, oh

Come back, come back, high or low
Before you're just a girl I used to know
And who will melt with me
When I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory

Come back, come back, high or low
Before you're just a girl I used to know
And who will melt with me
When I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory
Come back, come back, come back baby
For I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory

Come back, come back, come back baby
For I am who you used to love
And you are just a memory
