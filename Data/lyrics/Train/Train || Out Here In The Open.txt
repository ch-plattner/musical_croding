
It's hard to be tied to you
When your rock keeps is falling down
Dudududuuu nananana
It's hard to be tied to you
When this rock keep falling down
Dudududuuu nananana

Out here in the open
Underneath the sun
Out here where I'm hoping
Someday you'll be the one
Out here on the open
I get to keep what's mine

It's hard to live up to you
When you're never doing anything wrong
Dudududuuu nananana
It's hard to live up to what you think of yourself
You know you've got to be putting me on
Dudududuuu nananana

Out here in the open
Underneath the sky
Out here where I'm hoping
I wanna get my wings and fly
Out here on the open
I get to speak my miiiiind

Got to get yourself up right
So what you finally tell you that you're too uptight
Hey hey
That's what I say

You've been working at the carwash way too long
You know that life is just about another funky song
Hey hey hey hey, thats what you say

Out here in the open
Underneath my name
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me
Someday everybody's gonna pay attention to me

And out here in the open, I get the chance to shine
Out here in the open, yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me
Someday everybody's gonna pay attention to me

Out here in the open
I get the chance to shine
I get the chance to shiiiiiine
