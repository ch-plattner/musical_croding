The dust has finally settled down 
The sun is shining on these pieces that are scattered all around 
This house was everything we knew 
Its where we kept our love and 
every single memory of me and you 
Every letter, every note, every dress you never wore under your coat 
Thrown away 
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor 
If we hold onto each other, we'll be better than before. 
And brick by brick, 
we will get back to yesterday 
When I made your body shiver and 
when you took my breath away, 
you took my breath away. 

The sky has made it back to blue, 
everything that's left is telling us the worst of it is through. 
Home has never felt so right, there's nothing in the way. 
There's nothing in between us 
knowing where we're going is inside. 
Every letter that I wrote, 
every dress you never wore under your coat 
Thrown away 
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor 
If we hold on to each other, 
we'll be better than before. 
And brick by brick, 
we'll get back to yesterday. 
When I made your body shiver 
and when you took my breath away. 

All the pictures that we've taken 
and the songs that we have played 
They have all kept track and 
followed back the love that we have made. 
Now they're spread out on the 
surface where we can try to congregate 
It's not too late to believe that we can get it all again 
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor, 
If we hold onto each other, 
we'll be better than before. 
And brick by brick, 
we'll get back to yesterday 
When I made your body shiver and 
when you took my breath away, 
you took my breath away. 
Brick by brick 
We'll get back to yesterday, 
when I made your body shiver and 
when you took my breath away, 
you took my breath away.
