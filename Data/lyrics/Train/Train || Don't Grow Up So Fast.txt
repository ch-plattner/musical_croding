Girl, you're right on time, trust me, you're not too late
I hate to see you rain, those mascara tears
But you can drown in the water beyond your years

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
You will get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
So don't grow up so fast

The world will turn, shadows fall
There's your pencil marks in the corner on the kitchen wall
Yeah, to remind us all

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
You will get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
So don't grow up so fast, ooh

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
We all get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
There's only so much sand in the hour glass
So don't grow up so fast, ooh
