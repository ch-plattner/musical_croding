
I know you turned your back on Mother nature,
For everything she puts you through.
She wakes up everyday and tries to Greet you,
I’m hopin’ that you’ll make it Through.

I caught every morning,
Tried to reach you,
And waited for your Saturday.
With sunshine, divine, I come Running,
I’m a change a’ heart away . . .

Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Mornin’ break in you
Get Out
And I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m Running after you.

Thought that he would be a High-class mover.
Well, he’s high now mover,
But his class aint new.
You were born to be a ballerina,
So you danced your way to Hollywood.
Well dancin’s what you got,
But not like you wanted,
Not like you wanted anything . . .

Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Mornin’ break in you
Get Out
and I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m running after you.

On the big sky, nothing at the top,
so stop and get a good look. . . at this miracle. . .
On the big line, nothin’ up above, just love,
so get a good look at this miracle. . .
‘Cause this miracle’s you . . .
This miracle’s you. . .

Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Mornin’ break in you
Get Out
and I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m running after you.

Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Mornin’ break in you
Get Out
and I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m running after you.

(Get out) And I wont (Get out) run unless im running after you,
(Get out) And I wont (Get out) run unless im running after you. . .
