Don't talk too fast to me-slow-I wanna know
Share your philosophy before you go-I wanna know
If I knew better, I wouldn't wanna say
If I knew better, I wouldn't let the words feel this way
Cold, so cold, like I woke up on the street
But isn't that the payback for being indiscreet
If I knew better, I'd climb up on my ego like a child.
If I knew better, I'd knock down the flag 
on your shoulder that's Swaying
If I knew better-I wouldn't change a thing 
So don't you talk so fast to me, slow I wanna know
