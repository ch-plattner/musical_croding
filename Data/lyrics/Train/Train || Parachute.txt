I wanna take you with me 
to life with no more yesterdays 
we can start again awake and so excited 
and change the way we always push 
we always push 

I'll open up and be your parachute 
and I'll never let you down 
so open up and be my human angel 
and we'll only hit the ground 
running 

and when the world gets sharp and tries to cut you down to size 
and makes you feel like giving in 
oh, I will stay, I will rain, I will wash the words and pain away 
and I will chase away the way we push 
the way we pull 
you're beautiful 

I'll open up and be your parachute 
and I'll never let you down 
so open up and be my human angel 
and we'll only hit the ground 
running 

and if it feels like we might drop 
it will stop 
so don't look down 
it wouldn't be the same without you 
this life is too good to give up on 

I'll open up and be your parachute 
and I'll never let you down 
so open up and be my human angel 
and we'll only hit the ground 
and we're gonna hit the ground 
running
