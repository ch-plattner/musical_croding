It just ain't where it's at for me anymore
So don't let the door hit you when you leave

You throw me in the fire just to save my life
A pretty little liar
When I call you out you'd rather put up a fight than just come clean

Get on your way to making someone else feel low
Then higher than they ever thought they could go
You already know

I'm giving you up, you're letting me down
Stop pretending that you're gonna turn yourself around

You already know, know, know
You already know, know, know, know
Don't ask me why you already know

I was the shoulder you leaned on
You made me feel like the next James Bond
Double O seven oh hell, you were heaven to me

But while you were saying what I wanted to hear
You started breaking ground on a new frontier
Always making love but never to me

So get on your way to making someone else feel low
Then higher than they ever thought they could go
You already know

I'm giving you up, you're letting me down
Stop pretending that you're gonna turn yourself around

You already know, know, know
You already know, know, know, know
Don't ask me why you already know

You already know that I'm done waiting
Going crazy hating myself for loving you
At least the one side of you I thought I knew

You already know
You already know, know, know, know
You already know, know, know, know
Don't ask me why
