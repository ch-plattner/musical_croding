[Chorus:]
I ain't no new sensation
Oh, no
But I'm better than I ever been
[x2]

Take a look at my situation, tearing it down just to start it up
I ain't no new sensation, but I'm better than I ever been
Used to spend time tryin' to chase it
Now I spent time tryin' to erase it
I ain't no new temptation, but I'm better than I ever been

[Chorus]

Take a look at this reputation,
It's not what it is, but what it's not
It ain't some new sensation, but it keeps getting better, (better)
and better, yeah
Use to spend time thinking there's a reason
Now I spend time knowing I'm in season
I ain't no new temptation, but I'm better than I ever been

And I've been running away from you for way too long
And all our trying
All your lying
All of your crying
I kept buying it, I waited too long

[Chorus x2]
