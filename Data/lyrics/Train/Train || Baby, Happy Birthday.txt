
I came to make it right
I know it was your birthday
now I do remember
But these days my mind ain't right
Maybe it's the pressure, think you can forgive me

Don't over think it baby
Doesn't mean that I am falling out of love

Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else sometimes
someone to depend on,
I don't know what's wrong with me
Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else sometimes
Someone that would never forget your birthday

I bet your family
never wanna see me,
sisters wanna knee me

Most times I think they're right
whistle in my memory
away just like a melody

And what was that alibi
Think what it's like to be me
Before you leave me

Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else sometimes
someone to depend on,
I don't know what's wrong with me
Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else sometimes
Someone that would never forget your birthday

When I met ya,
you were looking for a sunny day,
a little bit of fun
and a whole lot of running away

And now you're looking at somebody
That you would love to change

Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else for you
someone you could count on
What is taking so long
Don't you think that I,
Wish that I could be somebody else sometimes
someone that would never forget your birthday
Baby, happy birthday
