
This ain't a threat but I think I better warn ya
Gonna fall in love if you go to California
I did and this is how I know..

By the beach north of San Jose
Met the right girl and it sounds cliche
but we decided not to take it slow

I said why wait your my soulmate
Took her by the hand in the golden state
Now that your mine things are gonna be fine...

First came love and a baby carriage
Hardly knew the people at my own damn marriage
where an open bar can open your mind

[Chorus]
You save my life with every word you say
You shine your light for me to find the way
Just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
Here with me born to be
Every part of you in Half Moon Bay...

Up in Tiburon where the girls are warm
We stay inside while the rain clouds form
And thank god for rainy days like these

Just when the time has come to retire
Baby starts cryin so we dance by the fire
Always does the trick you better believe

[Chorus]
You save my life with every word you say
You shine your light for me to find the way
Just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
Here with me born to be
Every part of you in Half Moon Bay...

Why go slow if it's nice and steady
We all know its in the stars already
oh ohh oh ohhhh
Why say no if yes feels right
You just go to go where it feels like home

This ain't a threat but I think I better warn ya
Gonna fall in love if you go to California
I did and this is how I know..

[Repeat Chorus]
You save my life with every word you say
You shine your light for me to find the way
Just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
Here with me born to be
Every part of you in Half Moon Bay...
