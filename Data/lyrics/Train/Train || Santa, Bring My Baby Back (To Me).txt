I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh Santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Santa bring my baby back to me

The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
The good is mistletoe
Oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Santa bring my baby back to me

Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here

Fill my sock with candy
No bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
And fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Santa bring my baby back to me

I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh Santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Santa bring my baby back to me

Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
Won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here

Fill my sock with candy
No bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
And fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

Well Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
