Finally met Virginia on a slow summer night
Thought I should forgive you so I came back
You’re a sight for sore eyes
Right for those lies
They save me after all!
Right from the beginning we were wrong I found
But no one did it better baby pound for pound 
Those heavyweight fights were right for me
To learn how to see the light clearly
And it’s the light I see in you!

[Chorus:]
No, don’t go 
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
No, don’t go
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
What it's like to be loved!

Now that things are better for me 
I can laugh at all your other lovers
When you do the math
Does it make you feel sad,
Make you feel small?
Thank God it ain’t about me anymore!
I’m not coming back for round 2
I just wanna love you like a friend would do
You weren't wrong for the feelings you had
But the man that I was isn’t coming back  
So stay, it’s OK!

[Chorus:]
No, don’t go 
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
No, don’t go
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
What it's like to be loved!
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

When you said it’s over
I lost my head!
And now that we’re older
I’m giving up on being right
So I can see the other side of you!

[Chorus:]
No, don’t go 
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
No, don’t go
I’ll show you what it’s like to be loved!
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
When you said it's Over
What it's like to be loved!
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I lost my head!
What it's like to be loved!
And now that we’re older
What it's like, what it’s like to be loved!
