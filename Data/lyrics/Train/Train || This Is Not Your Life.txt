I don't understand you,
The way you disappear,
You don't understand me,
The way I keep us here.

This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life.

We were only children,
But you knew the game,
And you were busy feeling,
That someone had to take the blame.

But I know how you're really,
When no one's around,
We were only children,
Looking to be found.

This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own.
This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own.
This is not your life...

Even after the fall,
No one ever seemed to care,
And now you come back to call,
And you want me to be here.

I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life,
And I know how to do it on my own,
And this is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own,
And this is not your life,
