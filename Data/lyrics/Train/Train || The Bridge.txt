What you wanna do? (Jump or burn it down)
What you wanna do?
What you wanna do? (Jump or burn it down)

We're at the bridge, together once more
We crossing over like we've done before
We can start a fire, go up in smoke
Jump into the water, do the back stroke
We're at the bridge, I love this view
But I don't know if I can cross again with you
We can start a fire, go up in smoke
Jump into the water, do the back stroke

Come on, what's it gonna be?
Come on, what's it gonna be?

I've got a feeling, you and I are the reason
Burn it down, to the ground
I need to know if you want me to
Jump or burn it to the ground
I've got to know now
Are you and I gonna go down in flames or drown?
I need to know if you want me to
Jump or burn it to the ground

This is what happens when you burn down a bridge
You jump into the fire or you learn to swim
This is what happens when you burn down a bridge
You jump into the fire or you learn to swim

Here at the bridge of loving you
Pushing one another's all we know how to do
We can start a fire, go up in smoke
Jump into the water and do the back stroke
Right from the start, hot and cold
Might get crazy but it never gets old
We can start a fire, go up in smoke
Jump into the water and do the back stroke

Come on, what's it gonna be?
Come on, what's it gonna be?

I've got a feeling, you and I are the reason
Burn it down, to the ground
I need to know if you want me to jump or burn it to the ground
I've got to know now
Are you and I gonna go down in flames or drown?
I need to know if you want me to jump or burn it to the ground
