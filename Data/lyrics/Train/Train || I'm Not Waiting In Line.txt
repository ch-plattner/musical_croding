
It's clear to see that you're down to earth
With a hold on what your worth
Like no other
And I'd like to thank your mother for that

I bet ya there's a line outside your door
And it's a line I know for sure
That you dont want from me
Like a hole in your head

I want to be just you just me
No tricks, no show
But I got to let you know

I'm not waiting in line
I'm not changing my mind for you
I'm not wasting my time
I'm not waiting in line for you

Now I think if we got something started
We would both fall in whole hearted
I'm not like no other
And you can thank my mother for that

I'm sure there is a line in front of me
And it's a line I'm sure to need from you
Like a whole in my head

I want to be just you just me
No tricks, no show
But I got to let you know

I'm not waiting in line
I'm not changing my mind for you
I'm not wasting my time
I'm not waiting in line for you

I've been saving myself for you 
But I'm not wasting my time for no one
Oh But if you want me to be
Baby I'll be rough enough
Baby I'll be tough enough
Oh you know I'm rich enough
But I wont be nobody's fool

I'm not waiting in line
And I'm not changing my mind for you
I'm not wasting my time
I'm not waiting in line for you

I'm not waiting in line
And I'm not changing my mind for you
I'm not wasting my time
I'm not waiting in line

Unless you want me to
