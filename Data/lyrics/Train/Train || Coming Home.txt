Am I really as different as I feel?
Maybe you're just too the same
Every smile just gets thrown on the pile
And everyone knows your pain
I'll think of this while you drink to that
Those glory days don't move me the way they move you

Coming home
Is living on a motorcycle
Jumping off to see my friend
I'm coming home
Feels like I'm leaving home instead

Do you really think I'm someone new?
Someone you don't recognize in any of you
Well, I don't resist it the way you do
Because change is the only thing that got me through this
I'll drink to this while you think of that
Those sunny days didn't warm me, they burned my skin

Coming home
Is living on an escalator
Jumping off to cry out loud
I'm coming home
Feels like I'm leaving home instead

I remember these streets, I had my both feet on the ground
While my head was in all of the clouds
I was something to see, nothing ever came free
She was mine when love meant nothing to me

Coming home
Is just another cruel reminder
Knowing that I'll never find her here
Coming home
Was living on a trampoline
Jumping up to see if there's anyone here
That knows what I mean

I'm coming home
Feels like I'm leaving home instead
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
