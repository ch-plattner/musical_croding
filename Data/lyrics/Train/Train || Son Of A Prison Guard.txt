There was a mountain on the table of bills that needed paid
Dishes in the kitchen sink like dreams that never fade.
A wild imagination, convicts in the yard,
Never enough time to make ends meet
So they put it on a credit card, don't we all?

You may not know just where you came from, but once upon a time
There was a carpenter, a bartender, a broken fishing line.
Just south of Royalty in the town that I came from,
There were architects and astronauts
But the only one she loved was a prison guard.

And that's the only time I ever saw true love.

America's a girl I liked in Georgia
London kept me warm up in Eugene.
I guess my mother bless her heart,
Set the bar too high to start.
'Cause finding love for me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard.

There's a gate that needed painting, clothes that needed clean.
They'd say there's time enough for that when the fun has all been seen.
'Cause when we're laying on our death bed, a promise we won't say
Wish we would have worked more, baby
Instead of loving you that way, no way.

And that's the only time I ever saw true love.

Sigourney is a girl I met in Brooklyn
Paris got me close in New Orleans
I guess my mother bless her heart,
Set the bar too high to start.
'Cause finding love for me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard.

I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are.

Betty is a girl I knew in Charlotte
Jordan left for Sydney yesterday.
I guess my mother bless her heart,
Set the bar too high to start.
'Cause finding love for me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard.
