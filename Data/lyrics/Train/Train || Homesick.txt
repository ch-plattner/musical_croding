
So you're tired of wakin' up on empty
You left for something that ain't real
So you think a couple of familiar faces
Is gonna turn it all around

You wanna be where they still pump your gas for you
Where they remember your name
They think that you are some beauty queen
Or something better
Where they remember your name

And ain't it good to think about the weather
Doesn't seem to be time for that no more
It's hard to hear when you're busy saying what you want said
What you want said, it ain't clear

You wanna be where they still open doors for you
It's not hard for them to remember you at all
They light your cigarette and tell their friends
You used to love them
Where they remember your name

More forgiveness
More time away from feeling like you do today
More forgiveness
More time away from feeling this way, alright

It's easy when you laugh, reminds you of you
It's easy when it's easy, it still ain't easy at all
So you're tired of waking up on empty
You left for something that ain't right
It ain't right, ain't right, no

You wanna be where they still pump your gas for you
Where they remember your name
They think that you are some beauty queen
Or something better
Where they remember your name

More forgiveness
More time away from feeling like you do today
More forgiveness
More time away from feeling like you do today, alright

Babe, you're getting better
Babe, you're getting better
Babe, you're getting better, yeah, yeah

More forgiveness, yeah
More forgiveness
More forgiveness
More time away from feeling this way
