They shine and they're never late
Don't break down on the interstate
You're right, new things are great
Good point, money ain't everything
But honey, having none sure stings
I love angels but I need kings
Good point, money ain't everything

I know that I can't buy
Happiness or love or time
But if anything could be mine
Then what I'd do is take fifth avenue
Niagra falls too
And maybe everything blue
And what I'd rather do
Is just stay right here with you

Laying on your futon, futon, futon
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
So much for being brave
When chivalry is aftershave
And what you drive is how you weigh in or out
So let's say hypothetically
That I own the baltic sea
To sink or swim you've got to ask please
Would I feel better if I had the keys?

I know that I can't buy
Happiness or love or time
But if anything could be mine
Then what I'd do is take fifth avenue
And what picasso drew
Or the mountains of peru
And what I'd rather do
Is just stay right here with you
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
Laying on your futon, futon, futon

So c'mon baby pass the grass
Is that remote underneath your ass
Cause I can't find it anywhere
Mmmm baby I should run downstairs
And grab us both a sweet coldstone
You want a cup or a waffle cone
Or hapiness or love or time
Or maybe I'll just take fifth avenue

I'll take the pyramids too
And maybe classes in kung fu or jiu jitsu
And what I'd rather do
Is just stay right here with you
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
Laying on your futon, futon, futon
