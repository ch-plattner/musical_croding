
Candles burnin' low,
Lots of mistletoe.
Lots of snow and ice,
Everywhere we go.
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door.

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

I feel like runnin' wild
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
(happiness in the comin' year)

Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair 
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, oh baby
(All these things and more, oh baby)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Candles burnin' low
Lots and lots of snow
Christmas bells are ringin'
Christmas choirs singin'
Come on yeah...
