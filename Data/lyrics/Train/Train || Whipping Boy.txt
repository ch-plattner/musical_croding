
Since then I never feel helpless, recess, this mess if you do
And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to
And we do
Well by now I've showed you how much I believe in the here and now and I wish that you knew 

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy 

You spilled your purse onto my bed
Searching for something for your head
Since then you never come clean I mean
You wish you only could 

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy 

I can get up:: 

And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to
And we do
And we do
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy
