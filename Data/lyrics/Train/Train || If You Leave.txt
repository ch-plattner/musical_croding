
Sweet dreams from Texaco, and I know your mind is on
its way to Mexico, sweet Jesus is on his way to take
you on his way down

You get your fill of what you like and you fill your head
with what you might want yourself to be when you're ready

But if you leave
It's gonna get a little bit easier to break down
And if you leave
It's gonna get a little bit easier for you to break down

My new dress is your new way out, my new way is your new
dress, and you look fine
But your new belief is my regret and my regret
leaves you to believe that we have found the line

And if you leave
Take me along, anywhere is ok
And if you leave
Take me along, anywhere is ok

Think back and you can feel me movin through you
It's easy when you try
Oh, think back and you can feel me, you can feel me
You won't feel me if you leave

And if you leave
It's gonna get a little easier for me to break down
And if you leave
If you leave
If you leave
If you leave
You won't feel me
