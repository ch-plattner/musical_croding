
Sleepless nights and endless days
And all I do is promise to change my ways
Leave the lights on, you know I'll pretend you're on you're way
You used to say that there's a time we all deserve to lose our minds
So I lost my mind now I'm ready to find my way 

Back home
Today
To stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear
To stay
The way you wished I would 

I don't know if I'm gonna have to redesign my mind
But tonight I made a wish and I sure hope that it comes true
Cause it's been too long without you
It's been too long 

Come home
Today
To stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear
To stay
The way I wish you would 

And even if I left it all behind
There'd be reason to come back
And even though I left you far behind
I always thought that you'd come here to find me
Come find me 

I don't know if I can wait this long
To be what I used to be
And I don't think I can wait much longer
For the tide to come back to me
Come back to me 

Back home
Today
To stay
The way I wish you would
And I swear
To stay
The way I wish you would
The way I wish you would
