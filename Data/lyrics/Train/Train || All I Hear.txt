
How many lives must I live
How many lies must I hear
How many times must I, feel so blue
How many times must I, lose you

All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart breakin' down
Or losing ground

How many bridges must I burn
How many lessons must I learn
How many times must I ask you to stay
How many times will you push me out of your way

All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart breaking down - losing ground
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart losing ground - slowing down

Maybe somebody will show me - a better way
Maybe somebody will know me - someday
How many times must I, hear your voice
Inside my dreams, your answering machine
You're always there and everywhere in between

All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart slowing down
Can ya hear the sound
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart leaving town, breakin' down
Slowin' down, losin' ground, breakin' down and stopping here

All I hear now
All I hear now
