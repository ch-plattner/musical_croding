
Well I climbed into my fathers shoes and felt like a loser
Never had a chance to swim
And all the things he'd say
came in from my grandpa's ways
Always loved him

But I don't want to be even more like that
I'm afraid to be any more like that
I don't know why I am saying this to you
I guess that I am afraid to lose what I know about me and you
For you

So if I ever get the chance
I wanna ask you to dance
After thirty days I'm dry

Climb into the Subaru, well only the best for you
Maybe we can drive all night
And I suppose that I could be your friend
But I don't know if I can last till then

Why you even bring this up right now?
Maybe it's cause I'm in love and how
With you
For you

And I don't even know why I feel so grey
I didn't mean to be this way
All I need is a chance to fight this through
And I hope that I can fight for you
For you
For me
