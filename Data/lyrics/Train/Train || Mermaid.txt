Whoa, whoa

Can’t swim so I took a boat
To an island so remote
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before.
Stayed there 'til the air was clear.
I was bored and out of tears,
Then I saw you washed up on the shore.

I offered you my coat,
Thank goodness love can float
Crazy how that shipwreck meant my ship was comin’ in.
We talked 'til the sun went down.
Love on the Puget Sound.
My treasure map was on your skin.

Beauty in the water,
Angel on the beach.
Ocean’s daughter.
I thought love was out of reach
'Til I got her.
Had I known it could come true?
I would have wished in ’92
For a mermaid just like you, whoa,
Just like you, whoa.

Sharks green with envy, they wonder what you see in me
Funny but sometimes can’t help but wonder that as well
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid
The way to this heavenly bay it went through hell

Beauty in the water,
Angel on the beach.
Ocean’s daughter.
I thought love was out of reach
'Til I got her.
Had I known it could come true?
I would have wished in ’92
For a mermaid just like you, whoa,
Just like you, whoa.

Rescued you by the banyan tree,
All the girlfish in the sea
Couldn't hold a candle to you,
They don’t have a handle on you,
They don’t have a scandal on you
I love Ecco Sandals on you
Saving me was B-I-G,
All the boyfish in the sea
They all wish that they could be me

Can’t swim so I took a boat,
To an island so remote
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before

Beauty in the water,
Angel on the beach.
Ocean’s daughter.
I thought love was out of reach
'Til I got her.
Had I known it could come true?
I would have wished in ’92
For a mermaid just like you, whoa,
Just like you, whoa.

Just like you, whoa
Just like you, whoa
