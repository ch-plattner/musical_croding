Heeeey, heeeey, heeeey

Only you can make this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you along can feel the like you do
And feel my heart, with love for only you

Only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you

Only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you
