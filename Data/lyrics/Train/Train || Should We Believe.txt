Let's blame it on something else
Blame it on the architects, the full moon
Anything but ourselves

How else we gonna get through the night
Cuz you're never wrong
and I'm not strong enough to tell
you what I'm thinking

Sometimes
it's not enough to be right
These times are never easy

Should we believe?
Should we believe in
I don't care which road we take
If it leads me back to you
If you could see what I'm feeling
I just want my best friend back again
Should we believe?

I can hear you down the hall
There's no more numbers left call now
It's me you need to talk to
I used to be the one on the other line
Until I traded in that friend of mine
For a kiss that led to love
and love has led to this

Should we believe?
Should we believe in
I don't care which road we take
If it leads me back to you
If you could see what I am feeling
I just want my best friend back again
Should we believe?

Should we believe?
Sometimes it's not enough to be right
These times are never easy

Should we believe?
Should we believe in
I don't care which road we take
If it leads me back to you

If you could see what I am feeling
I just want my best friend back again
I just want my best friend back again
Should we believe?

Blame it on something else
anything but ourselves
