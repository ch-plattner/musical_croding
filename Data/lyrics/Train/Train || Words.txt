
I'd give anything but I won't give up on you 
I'd say anything, but not goodbye 
I will run with your changes and I'm always on your side 
And there's not a word I've ever heard that would make me change my mind 

Words they'll try to shake you 
Don't let them break you 
Or stop your world from turning 
When words keep you from feeling good 
Use them as firewood and let them burn 

Like stones in your pocket people try to wear you down 
Someone always wants to take the love you've found 
So let's runs with these changes and I want you by my side 
And there's not a word I've ever heard that would make me change my mind 

Words they'll try to shake you 
Don't let them break you 
Or stop your world from turning 
When words keep you from feeling good 
Use them as firewood and let them burn 

Let them burn 
Let them burn 
Underneath every word somebody's heart been broken 
With or without words we try to forgive 

Words they'll try to shake us 
Don't let them break us 
Or stop our world from turning 
When words keep you from feeling good 
Use them as firewood and let them burn 

Words they'll try to shake you 
Don't let them break you 
Or stop your world, stop your world from turning round
When words keep you from feeling good 
Use them as firewood and let them burn 

Let them burn 
Let them burn
