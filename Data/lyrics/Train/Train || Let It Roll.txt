
Tried to write a letter
To tell you how I feel
But all I kept on writing
Was slipping on the tears from the day
When I was young and brave
Now all these hotel lobbies are filled with what's to me
Lonely midnight drivers
Drifting out to sea
And all those late night lovers
Don't make things better to me 

So let it roll into me
Let it roll into you
Let it roll into me
Let it roll back into when I had you 

So I'll watch the snow come calling
And I'll celebrate the spring
I'll feel the falls keep falling
And when the summers come
I will pretend that I don't notice
That this is when I notice most of all 

So let it roll into me
Let it roll into you
Let it roll into me
Let it roll back into when I had you 

And all you ever wanted for me
Was the time to understand
And all I ever wanted for you
Was to see me shining for you
And I wish that I could be back in the day that I could say 

Let it roll
Let it roll into me
Let it roll
Let it roll into you
Let it roll back into when I had you
