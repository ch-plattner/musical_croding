
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he turn up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you that the old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What will your daddy do
When he sees your Mama kissin' Santa Claus?

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside in a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been Slade

So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
