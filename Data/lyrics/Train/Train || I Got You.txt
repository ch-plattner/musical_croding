
Hey, did you hear about the one that got away, they say he looked left, 
she turned right-meant to be together but not that night, 
it's when fates running late, we tend to make mistakes, 
we go round and round from love to love 
it's either way too much or not enough 
gimme lazy days with nothing better to do 
than singin oh black water keep on rolling while I wait for you 
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine, 
I'm leaving the ghosts behind until I got you I got you 
you're the sun through my window, warming my skin Oh you, 
I got you 
hey then when one of them was taken, the other one was waiting 
for the next big thing 
To bring them to the gates of heaven or maybe just late night in Vegas 
It's true that's what we do when were going down swingin- 
then coming up singing the blues 
Wearing out my shoes-chasing new faces to get to you- 
driving home on a summer night 
Singing old black water keep on rolling- till the time is right 
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine sit back enjoy the ride 
until I got you I got you you're the sun through my window 
warming my skin, oh you I got you Like Sonny and Cher 
Except I'll be there for you , I got you 
Let old black water bring us together - old black water keep on rolling 
Mississippi moon won't you keep on shining on me 
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland 
Pretty Mama come on take me by the hand, wanna hear some funky Dixieland 
Pretty mama come on take me by the hand 
Here she comes, here she comes I got you I got you 
You're the sun through my window warming my skin oh you 
I got you like Sonny and Cher you know I'll be there for you 
I got you let old black water bring us together 
You I got you, I got you , I got you baby 
By the hand hand take me by the hand 
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long wanna hear some 
Funky Dixieland pretty mama come and take me by the hand
