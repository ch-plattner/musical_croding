
When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

Is this forever?
This feelin' I got
Not enough and too much
So free and so caught up 
In somethin' and nothin'
Both at the same time
I'm either out of my head
Or I'm out of my mind

When I find out who I am 
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

Is this forever?
This feelin' that I'm not
Movin' at all
But I just can't stop it
Its like I'm dreamin'
And I'm wide awake too
Will you remember me
Cause I won't forget you

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

I guess I was savin' my life for later
When maybe I should've been givin' myself to you
Now I will, but I got to find out who I am before I do...
Before I do

When I find out who I am I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again I know, I'm gonna give myself to you
I'm gonna give myself to you
I'm gonna give myself to you
