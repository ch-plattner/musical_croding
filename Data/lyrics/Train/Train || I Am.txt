
I never been on a railroad, as many times as they pass me by
I never crashed in the desert or seen a rodeo
I don't know much about the world wars or Vietnam
I've yet to read about Uncle Tom
Never climbed a real rock or seen Colorado

Am I the son I think I am
Am I the friend I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be - hey

I never had a day where money didn't get in my way
I never listened to much Elvis
I can't remember a warm December

Am I the son I think I am
Am I the friend I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be

I'm here for my sanity sanity
I am here for you
I'm here for your fantasy sanity, I am here 
I am

Am I the son I think I am
Am I the father that I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be

I'm here for my sanity sanity I am here for you
Whether or not I'm walkin in
Or whether or not I'm walkin out
I'm always here for you

And I'm here for my sanity sanity
I am here for you
I'm here for my fantasy sanity, I am here 
I am
