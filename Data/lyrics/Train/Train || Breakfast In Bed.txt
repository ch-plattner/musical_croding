California, dancing in the ocean 
How I love you, better with some lotion 
Sun is always shining. 
No one compares to you. 

Sidney baby, young and like a flower 
How I want you, give me just an hour. 
You seem like an angel. 
No one compares to you. 

You're the best book I ever read. 
You're the smartest thing I ever said. 
You're breakfast in bed. 

When in Norway you can do me more ways 
Than any other you treat me like a mother loves her baby 
Baby, do I do it for you? 
Oh, 'cause all I ever wanted, baby, was baby to do it for you. 

You're the best dream in my head. 
You're my calm thought when I see red. 
You're better than punk rock cred. 

You're breakfast in bed. 
You're breakfast in bed. 
You're breakfast in bed. 

Wanna please you, wanna Japanese you 
How I need you, dress you up and feed you. 
Love you like a daddy loves his baby, baby do it for me. 

You're the fastest race I ever led. 
You're the finest bride I'll ever wed. 
You're the skin I never wanna shed. 

You're breakfast in bed. 
You're breakfast in bed. 
You're breakfast in bed.
