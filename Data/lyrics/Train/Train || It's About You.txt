Where I've been or what I won
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got keep what I find
It's about you
It's about you 

This ain't about the things you say
Or how you make me feel this way
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got keep what I find
It's about you
It's about you 

And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
And I could be
That everything you need
And I know this could be
That free fall back to me 

This ain't about the things I've done
Where I've been or what I won
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got keep what I find
It's about you
It's about you
It's about you
It's about you
And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me 

Cause I could be
That everything you need
And I know this could be
That free fall back to me 

But keeping you ain't easy
With everyone that sees me
Telling me get back on the ground
It never could be easy
Instead of you just pleasing me
You're keeping me down
And I know this could be
That freefall
Come on jump to me
