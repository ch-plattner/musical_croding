If I could dance, or stay in this place
I would be King and you would be mine
I would be day and you would be time

Eggplant and Caviar for you
For you, for you, for you
Eggplant and Caviar for you

Hold up my wings 'cause you are the sky
Paint me by numbers and don't ask me why
I am in bloom and you are perfume
And you are perfume and you are

Eggplant and Caviar for you
For you, for you, for you
Eggplant and Caviar for you
for you, for you, for you ‒ ah, ah, ah, ah

Apple pie or apple seed
All the mouths that I must feed
Cold sheets or tumbleweed
All the ones that I must need

I would be King and you would be mine
I would be nine and you would be Mother Time

Eggplant and Caviar for you
For you, for you, for you
Eggplant and Caviar for you
for you, for you, for you ‒ ah, ah, ah, ah

Apple pie or apple seed
All the mouths that I must feed
Cold sheets or tumbleweed
All the ones that I must need
All the ones that I must need
All the ones that I must need
All the ones that I must need
All the ones that I must need
