All alone or so It feels
Where are you going
Finally knowing
That nobody knows

And if you ever need my hands
To carry you through heavy times
Or look in to your wondering eyes
To remind you what you are

Skyscraper 
You define the skyline
Opposite the grapevine
Where crows and rumors fly

And if you ever need my hands
To carry you through heavy times
Or look in to your telling eyes
To remind you what you are

Skyscraper
Half way to the show
Giving every sunrise some connection
Protection from a bitter sun

Skyscraper
You define the skyline
Opposite the grapevine
Where crows and rumors fly

Skyscraper
