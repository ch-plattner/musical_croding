Underneath these lifelong
Things that were right 'till they went wrong
When misunderstood stood in my way
Now down in the heart of the matter of fact
There's a place I remember and I want to go back
Where I stop getting even
And started to change
All I want is you to see me

Here I am
You still know me
Here I am
Take another look
Here I am
Same old story in a brand new book

If second chances were dances
You know I would have two left feet
But at least I'd have a front row seat to love
And so I've been turning it upside down
Shakin' it up and shakin' it out
And now running for you
Instead of running from me
All I want is you to see me

Here I am
I'm new as morning
Here I am
Just like a sun
Here I am
Without one and I'm the one for you

Here I am
You still know me
Here I am
Take another look
Here I am
Same old story in a brand new book

And now I get a set of second chances to turn
The pages of the lessons of the love that I learn
Was true now all that is missing is you

And all I want is your to see me

Here I am
New as morning
Here I am
Just like a sun
Here I am
Without one and I'm the one for you

Here I am
You still know me
Here I am
Take another look
Here I am
Same old story in a brand new book

Here I am
Here I am
Same old story in a brand new book
