
The color of my hair is changing,
my skin is soft, too soft for a man my age
And I am never alone
Where is time taking me?

Nothing is real, this is how I feel
And nothing is wrong but everything takes too long

How did this end up me against you?
With everything that I say, and everything you do?
Your smile is changing â€’ yeah
Where is time taking you?

Nothing is real, this is how I feel
Nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind
If you don't mind doing time
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long

Hey, by the way, when I fell to your wayside
Did I crash or just slide?
Hey, by the way, when I pulled myself up to your wayside
Did I hurt you or just slide in?

So this is how it feels to get a little older
And, some would say, wiser?
We know what that means, maybe not
Well, maybe that's what that means, maybe not

Nothing is real, this is how I feel
Nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind
If you don't mind doing time
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long

Hey, by the way, when I fell to your wayside
Did I crash or just slide?
Hey, by the way, when I pulled myself up to your wayside
Did I hurt you or just slide in?

I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
