
Now don't look down
Cause you might just see what's in the middle
Rumor has it you've been looking for me
But there ain't much left of me to see

Now don't go down - no, no
Put your face in the place of a beetle
Your lip is about to shine
For a fee you'll be happy to be

Look at yourself child
Your the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
Till you wed on a track for a train in the rain
And it's coming fast

Ooh ooh ooh ooh train

You go so fast
It's a race for the place in the running
And it won't take long till it brings you down
No, I'm just a wasting, just a wasting time in the big town

Look at yourself child
Ooh ooh ooh ooh train
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Well, it's about a quarter till four
And I'm not really here no more
Sixteen and I've been on down
And now I've got a mess
And the back of your leg starts to drag down my,
Starts to drag down my, down my street
Here it goes again - yeah, yeah

Look at yourself girl, look at myself boy
Look at yourself girl, look at yourself girl
Look at yourself world, look at yourself child

Your the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
Till you wed on a track for a train in the rain
And it's coming fast

Ooh ooh ooh ooh Train
Your the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
Till you wed on a track for a train in the rain
And it's coming fast
