It's been days since I been doin well
since I don't feel like hell or crawlin under you
It's been crazy feelin like I do. I'd like to blame it all
on you for crawlin under me-Yea
Am I wrong for takin this so hard, for tearin me apart
tearin me apart, partly tearin me a whole in my heart
Hey is everybody right, have I become so uptight, I'm givin it away
And if blame is the answer, it's under control
And if shame is the answer, I'm sellin my soul
And if pain is the answer, I've seen it all
Hey Hey Hey, I'm tryin' to calm you down
Don't seem to see it the way I see it
Round & Round & Round
Everybody's feelin uptight
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey is everybody is everybody on
the same page, am I just one to move about the house this way
And if blame is the answer, it's under control
And if shame is the answer, I'm sellin my soul
And if pain is the answer, I've seen it all
Hey Hey Hey, I'm tryin' to calm you down
It's been days since I been doin well
Since I don't feel like hell or crawlin under you
