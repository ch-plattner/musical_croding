
I don't wanna wake up
'Cause that might mean that we could break up
But I don't wanna take up
Anymore of your time than you want me to
Now I don't wanna scare you
If its too soon to say that I'll be here for you
Or say that I'll be there for you
Or say that I'll be anywhere for you

I wanna believe,
That every moment full of madness
Is all for a moment full of magic here with you - Yeah
I wanna believe,
That every moment full of magic
Is gonna be here with you
Only you

I don't ever wanna come down
'Cause that might mean this high is endin'
Or that this love is pendin'
Can you feel me sendin', My love
Now I don't wanna mess you up
Wanna dress you up, in the love I'm sendin'
Its never endin', My love

I wanna believe,
That every moment full of madness
Is all for a moment full of magic here with you - Yeah
I wanna believe,
That every moment full of magic
Is gonna be here with you
Only you

The sky is dancin' to the music that the mountains sing
My heart is jumping from the feelin' that your kisses bring
Im either sleepin' or I'm creepin' into heaven with you
Ahh - You feelin' it too

I wanna believe,
That real love can come true
I wanna believe me, I wanna believe in you, Yeah

I wanna believe,
That every moment full of madness
Is all for a moment full of magic here with you - Yeah
I wanna believe
That every moment full of magic
Is gonna be here with you, only you
Gonna be here with you, only you, yeah
I wanna believe, I wanna believe - Yeah
