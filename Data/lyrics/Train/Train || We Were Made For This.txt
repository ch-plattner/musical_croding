
I woke up on Angel Island in your arms
To the smell of burning bridges
And the sound of those alarms in my head,
We should have stayed in bed

But we held them up for ransom anyway
When the coldest days of winter were
The summers that we took aim at the Bay
And grateful wasn't dead

And like your lips were only made for me to kiss
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

While the girls all danced beneath a burning man
And the last waltz did somersaults to finish off the Band
Where they began in a wonder Winterland
All we ever wanted was to be alone
Learning how to fly to Sly, trying to find home
Underneath the Family Stone

And just like New Year's Day was made to reminisce
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

Love and stardust settle on us like a net
While Buckley's "Hallelujah" fills our ears from your cassette
While my heart stops beating, and you stop breathing, Juliette

You're the only thing I'm ever gonna miss
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this
