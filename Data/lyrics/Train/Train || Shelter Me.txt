
Hey, na na na... hey hey - thought about you
Hey, na na na... I'll make it with or without you

I went walking in your shoes today
It took me back to that familiar way
That I felt when our team was on the winning side
So I paged through some pictures that you left behind

Hey, na na na... hey hey - thought about you
Hey, na na na... I'll make it with or without you

I guess I would have known love if it whispered in my ear
All I know right now is that its been almost a year
That I traded in forever for a kiss that day
But how about some shelter if I promise not to stay

Hey, na na na... hey hey - thought about you
Hey, na na na... I'll make it with or without you

Shelter Me
Come on baby please
I don't need for you to feel the same
Cover me, come on cant you see
I just need to come in from the rain
Shelter Me

I know that you need to find someone who will get you
Thought I was the one
I know that I need to find someone who let me
Thought you were the one

Hey, na na na... hey hey - thought about you
Hey, na na na... I'll make it with or without you

Shelter Me
Come on baby please
I don't need for you to feel the same
Cover me, come on cant you see
I just need to come in from the rain

Hey, na na na... hey hey - thought about you
Hey, na na na... I'll make it with or without you
