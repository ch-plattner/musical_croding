
I just opened up my eyes
And let the world come climbing in
It's all better now, things are gonna work somehow
If I just sleep another hour
Tried to reach you at your mom's
Hey baby why you trying to keep away for so long
I stopped feeling good, somehow I just knew I would
I guess I'll sleep another hour
Feels like I'm wasting my time
Hanging on this same old line
Got to get you off of my mind
There's nothing left for me to find 

And all the more I want
All the more I need
All the while you want something more
All the more I want
All the more I need
All the while you want something more 

Thought I found the words to say
Just to get you feeling fine over heels my way
But it don't matter how
I lost the word and nerve and now
There's nothing more for me to say
Feels like I'm wasting my time
Hanging on this same old line
There's nothing left for me to find 

And all the more I want
All the more I need
All the while you want something more
All the more I want
All the more I need
All the while you want something 

There's nothing left for me to say
Wanting what I need this way
And when I'm feeling low I know
I need to stop 

And someday you will see
All the more you want
All the more you'll need me
All the while I'll be on to something more
And all the more you want
All the more you'll need me
All the while I want something more
I want something more
I want something more than this
