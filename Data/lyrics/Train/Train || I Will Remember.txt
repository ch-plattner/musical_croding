Have you ever done love, it's like a drug
It'll mess you up good, mess you up bad
Make you fall harder than you ever had
Did you ever get dumped?
By somebody that you thought was the one
But somebody told you that you're not the one for them
And then your friends all say
They've been cheating on you anyway

Did you ever been mugged, it ain't fun
Have you ever done love, what's the difference
It'll mess you up good, mess you up bad
Make you fall harder than you ever had

Did you give it all you got?
'Til your heart went snap, crackle, pop
'Cause somebody told you that you're not the one for them
And then your friends all say
They were cheating on you anyway

Here's to us, we were at the top
And here's to never knowing when we're not
The time we had together, ooh
Love is not supposed to stop
If you forget, I will remember

Did you ever get drunk because of love
Did it put you in a funk when it was over
Did it pick you up high, knock you down low?
Did it make you wish hard that you didn't know
Are you still going hard 'cause I am
Better by far, because of them
And together we will never let 'em get the better of us now

Here's to us, we were at the top
And here's to never knowing when we're not
The time we had together, ooh
Love is not supposed to stop
If you forget, I will remember

If you're up, if you're down
If you're lost, if you're found
Just remember that we're bound to love
If you're up, if you're down
If you're lost, if you're found
Just remember that we're bound to love

Here's to us, we were at the top
And here's to never knowing when we're not
The time we had together, ooh
Love is not supposed to stop
If you forget, I will remember

(Oh) Here's to us, we were at the top
(Oh) And here's to never knowing when we're not
(Oh) Love is not supposed to stop
(Oh) If you forget, I will remember
