Understand this, I'm not looking
For true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight

I've been working everyday eight to nine and
Servin' coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

Understand this, I've been liking
You since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at all

I've been working eight to nine everyday and
Think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I want to see you I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so
Why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid bitch
You got it's me you should be seeing

Hello you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a goldmine, goldmine
Asking everybody is he mine, is he mine
Not quite yet but I'm gonna get, get him
Not quite yet but I'm gonna get, get him

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby
