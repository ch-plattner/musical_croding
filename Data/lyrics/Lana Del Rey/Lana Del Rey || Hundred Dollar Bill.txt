Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I’m in my party dress
He say, you such a mess
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen
He is the Gangster Action King
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best
'Cause he knows what’s up
He knows it’s a big bad world
Knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
('Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

(Eh ah)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

J. is a romantic roller coaster
He don’t do anything he supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean
Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling
He is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be
Looking to die
He says baby pay
Respect to the high
He knows it’s a big bad world
knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
'Cause cash comes quick when looks can (kill)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Eh yeah yay
Eh yeah ah
Ah ah ah

I like your ultra-violent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue, woo
I like your ultra-violent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue, woo

(Yeah ah yay)

(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
