Salvatore you can def be
My baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock n´roll high
Back to Malibu
In our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy
Loved in the fight

We got a jumper
got a jumper
got a jumper
got a junk on
My man’s crazy and his mind is a knife
But I like him – fact, i love him
I can’t get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight

I’ve been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now
too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
but I don’t know how
don’t know how

It’s gonna backfire
It’s gonna backfire, baby
gonna backfire
gonna backfire, baby
Told you one million times before
Yes, I’ll run for it a million more

Tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose wit’ you, man
And  it’s  not something you choose
You say trouble follows you
It’s been like that since the day you began

We’ve got a jumper
got a jumper
got a jumper
got a jumper
I know very well you’re bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

I’ve been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now
too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
but I don’t know how
don’t  know how

It’s gonna backfire
It’s gonna backfire, baby
gonna backfire
gonna backfire, baby
We’ve done it a million times before
Yes, I’ll run for it a million more

We’re always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown’s always coming around
Tappin’ on our windows
“Kids, come out
Ain’t  no way to live
Let me show you how”
But we know we’re not gonna change
Keep hustlin’ every night and day

I’ve been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now
too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
but I don’t know how
don’t know how

It’s gonna backfire
It’s gonna backfire, baby
gonna backfire
gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million a million times before
And I’ll run for it a million more
