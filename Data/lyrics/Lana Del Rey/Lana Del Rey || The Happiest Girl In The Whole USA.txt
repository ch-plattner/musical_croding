Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day 
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.

Good morning, mornin', hello sunshine 
Wake up, sleepy head 
Why'd you move that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute that's why we moved it
One more hug or two 
Do you love wakin' up next to me 
As much as I love wakin' up next to you?

You make the coffee, I'll make the bed 
I'll fix your lunch, and you'll fix mine! 
Now tell me the truth do these old shoes look funny? 
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful, got to go 
"I love you, have a beautiful day!" 
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.

Skippidy doo da thank you
Lord for makin' him for me 
And thank you for letting life turn out the way 
That I always thought it could be

There once was a time, that I could not imagine 
How it would feel to say I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.

Now shine on me sunshine 
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day 
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.

Shine on me sunshine 
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day 
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.

Shine on me sunshine 
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day 
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
