And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
he was the only one for me.

We both knew it, right away.

And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
we were faced with more challenges.

I begged him to stay. 
Try to remember what we had at the beginning. 
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it. 
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
to talk to him. 
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.

I always got the sense that he became torn
between being a good person and
missing out on all of the opportunities that life could
offer a man as magnificent as him.

And in that way I understood him
and I loved him.
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him.
I love him.
