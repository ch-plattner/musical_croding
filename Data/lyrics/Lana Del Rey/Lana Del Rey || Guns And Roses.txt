
Mm, heavy metal love of mine,
I should've learned to let you stay.
You didn't want me all the time,
But you were worth it anyway.

'Cause you were so much better,
Than the rest of them,
Out of all the others,
You were the honest man.

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
Roses, roses.

Motorcycle love, divine,
I should've learned to let you play.
I wasn't the marryin' kind,
I should've done it anyway.

We should've left Las Vegas,
And then began again.
To kill thy king, Detroit,
Back to the promised land.

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
Roses, roses.

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight,
See you workin' on that blue Pacific,
I can see you bathing in the summer light,
Turnin' tan, and you left terrific

You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
Roses, roses.

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns and roses,
Roses, (roses), roses, (roses)

Roses, roses, roses.
