Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Hair thin and in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
Hot shot at two A.M.
You got that grin of a very old man

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you, do you wanna?

Just do what you love, just do what you can
Just do what you love, just do what you can
Just do what you love, do it better than
Just do what you love, do it better than

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Jump
