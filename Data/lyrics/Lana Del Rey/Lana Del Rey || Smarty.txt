
Do I make you feel like Christmas time?
Put me in a party dress one time
Love me till I see the sunshine
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody
Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Nobody
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody

Say I make you feel like christmas time
Say I make you feel like christmas time
Tell me that I feel like christmas time
Put me in a party dress one time
Baby, if you love me you'll call me a bunny
Tell me I'm just a baby, honey
Beat me and tell me no one will love me
Better than you do
Better than you do

Dance me all around the room
Dance me around the room
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Dance me all around the room
Say you'll never leave me

Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody
Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Nobody
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody

Say I make you feel like
Like you did, like you did when you were thirteen
Say I make you feel like
When you were the dirty heavy metal king
Say I make you feel alright, alright, alright

Kissing me till I see the sunshine
Kissing me till I see the sunshine
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Is yours tonight
This little world is yours tonight
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody
Who has the face like smarty does?
Who has the voice like smarty does?
Nobody
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
