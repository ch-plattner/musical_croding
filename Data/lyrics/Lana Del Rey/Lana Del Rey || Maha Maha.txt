
Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both we dead if you found out

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

La la mahi mahi la la 
La la mahi mahi la la 
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say alright, you're right mon cher it is
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha

La la mahi mahi la la 
La la mahi mahi la la 
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

Where we sing Maha, oh Maha, oh Maha, Maha

I give my life back 
I'm your devoted
I give my love babe
I'm your devoted
Maha Maha, Maha Maha, Maha, Maha
