
All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus,
Jumping off of bridges,
Sparklers and streamers honey,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly.

Boy you wanna come to my motel honey,
Boy you wanna hold me down,
Tell me that you love me,
Boy you know that I have really never loved nobody but you.

Boy you wanna come to my motel honey,
Boy you wanna hold me down,
Tell me that you love me,
Boy you know that I have really never loved nobody but you.

All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus,
Coney Island beaches,
Chandeliers and seizures honey,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly.

I can't be with the man I love,
I can't be if he treats me rough,
I can't see him,
I can't call him up.

All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches,
Alabama breezes,
Platinum and peaches,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly,
I wanna fly.

I can't be with the man I love,
I can't be if he treats me rough,
I can't see him,
I can't call him up.

Boy you wanna come to my motel honey,
Boy you wanna hold me down,
Tell me that you love me,
Boy you know that I have really never loved nobody but you.

Boy you wanna come to my motel honey,
Boy you wanna hold me down,
Tell me that you love me,
Boy you know that I have really never loved nobody but you.
