
You know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You wont, you wont get me very far
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh the wind is carrying me home
me home me home again

Well you know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You wont, you wont get me very far
You saw life back in the countryside
ahhh ahh ahh

Oh my soul rise up & go beyond, beyond
to what you know
