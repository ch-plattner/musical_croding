
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no
But I gotta get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go
Oh no, oh oh, oh oh...

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things go
