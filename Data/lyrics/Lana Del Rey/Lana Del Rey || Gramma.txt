Gramma said the flags are waving for me
Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man, waiting for me

All I want to do is play
See the city every day
Pretty party nation

Tell me that you think I'm good
Happy that I make you glad
'Cause I don't want to think I'm bad, Gramma
I don't want to think I'm bad

Trouble's what feels good to me
Crazy as since I was three
Now I'm out to get you

But I'd have bet that lately, Ma
And I'm in love with everyone
And I don't want to think I'm wrong
Just for feeling pretty

I want to be the whole world's girl, gramma
I want to be the whole world's girl
I want to be the whole world's girl, gramma
Tell me do you think that's wrong?

Don't cry, honey, crazy girl
Don't you know you are the world?
Every time you feel unsure
Try to remember what you are
