
They all know my name now, 
it's just another lonely day on the playground,

Okay, let's go, 1,2,3,4 

No I'm not vintage, no I don't care,
No I'm not Kylie, no you can't compare me to another one,
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself,
It's not fight club, I'm a rare snowflake,
But if I hear you bringing me down calling me so fake,
I will fight you, I will fight you,
Cause in the end there's only truth and God is gonna smite you,
Besides that, I don't like you

I just wanna party boy I don't wanna fight,
But everybody knows that that's the way it is,
Only players can survive,

They all know my name now, 
it's just another lonely day on the playground,
Rain rain go away now,
Come again another day in the game now (only players can survive)

No I'm not retro, no I'm not fair,
Yes I'd like to re-record in heels and underwear and,
It's not Scarface 'cause imma live forever,
If I hear from anyone your trynna get too clever then,
I will fight you, I will win,
I will rise again and soar in the wind,
It's my destiny and where my life begins,
So if you in my way I'll knock you down like Kingpin,

I just wanna party boy I don't wanna fight,
But everybody knows that that's the way it is, only players can survive,

They all know my name now, 
it's just another lonely day on the playground,
Rain rain go away now,
Come again another day in the game now,

Ring around the Rosie ow, 
I don't wanna fall down, keep my feet on the ground,
Pocket full of nursery rhymes,
I'm just biding my time, biding my lines

I'm wearing the invisible crown, you can't see it yet,
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner yes,
Sometimes I rap too, I'm a white girl,
But the world is my oyster, I'm a little pearl, yep

They all know my name now,
it's just another lonely day on the playground,
Rain rain go away now,
Come again another day in the game now,

Ring around the Rosie ow, 
I don't wanna fall down, keep my feet on the ground,
Pocket full of nursery rhymes, 
I'm just biding my time, biding my lines,
