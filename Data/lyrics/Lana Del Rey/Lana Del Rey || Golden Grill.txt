See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're pickin up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turn criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you, babe?
You, babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are. There we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you found your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you, babe?
You, babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

There's someone's child for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been tonight

There's no more chances for you now. You never learn,
You live on fire, baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you, babe?
You, babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe?
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way
