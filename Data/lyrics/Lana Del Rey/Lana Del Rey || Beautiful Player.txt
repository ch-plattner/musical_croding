
Uh, what, Stars, Stars
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

You’re so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can’t get enough
Enough of you

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry

(Sing it to me, babe)

‘Cause you’re the beautiful player
You’re a beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah…

(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a truck top backrub time of our lives
He's selling stars on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens

We're feeling like we wanna die fast
‘Cause he’s been breaking the law and he’s not going back
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it’s true, I live for you

(Sing it to me, babe)

‘Cause you’re my beautiful player
You’re my beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-yeah…

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only want I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

Hit me and it felt like a kiss, baby
If it don’t hurt then I’ll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love’s law and he can’t give

(Sing it to me, babe)

‘Cause he’s my beautiful player
He’s my beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-yeah…
