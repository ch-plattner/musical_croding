All dressed up with nowhere to go,
That's the story of the girl you know, me.

I'm all smiles but inside I frown, 'cause,
I see you walkin' around with Betty Lou,
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you,
It don't matter to you,
It don't matter to you,
What those other girls do.

You'll date anyone,
You'll date anyone,
Are they more fun that me, baby?

I'm smilin', the New Jersey queen and,
You're the best thing I ever seen,
So won't you pull up your white corvette,
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face,
I know it ain’t doin’, but I know what you like,
So come on inside and I’ll fix you ice cream,
A little banana split for you, Jimmy, ooh.

You’re so fine you’re like silk la roux,
Guess that’s why you keep slipping through,
My fingers, ooh.

You’re the state’s number one,
Everybody knows it.
You smile all the time,
‘Cause how can you not show it,
When even you know that you’re so,
To die for, to die for?
What do the need to get high for,
When I have you, when I have you?

It don't matter to you,
It don't matter to you,
It don't matter to you,
What those other girls done.

I’m gonna prove to you,
I’m gonna prove to you,
You’ll never find nobody more fun.

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
Oh, more fun.
