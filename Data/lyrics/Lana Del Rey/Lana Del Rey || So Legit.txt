
You were the freak king
Of the piercing shop,
All the girls thought they could sing,
But they're really not shit.
I don't get it

You're looking like a man,
You're talking like a baby.
How the fuck is your song in
a Coke commercial, crazy?
I don't get it,
Your taste once exquisite.

What happened to Brooklyn,
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene,
What happened to punk rock, rock?

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe.
How the fuck would you switch it up and then replace me?
I don't get it, I'm so legit.

Tell me was it 'cause I wasn't platinum and jewels?
That perhaps you thought I was a little bit even uncool.
Kid, was that it?

Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million.
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg.
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt, yeah.

Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls,
Thinking that you're number one.
You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not.

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere, 
If you can make it here.
But, where?
No magic in the air?

What happened to Brooklyn,
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be
dangerous and we were born bad,
And we were born bad?

Punk rock, punk rock.

The boys used to punch each other in the face,
and girls were walking around wasted.
And everybody had a good night,
Come back in the sunlight.

Punk rock, Punk rock.

Rock.
