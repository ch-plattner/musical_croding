I’m a wild child, bright child
Knockin’ at your door
You thought that you were done
But now you want me even more
Dum Dum
Want me even more, dum dum

I’m a star child, big smile
Livin’ in LA
I’m comin’ over baby
You can't go to school today
Dum Dum
Go to school today, dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O’Hara
Of the downtown scene
Cause I just wanna drink
I just wanna drink

I’m a pop blues singer
Fan ban zinger
Mansfield ringer
From the Hollywood silver screen
Silver screen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You’ll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You’ll be forever changed

I’m a wild child, sky high
Lyin’ on your floor
I know I had a lot
But babe I want a little more
Dum dum
Want a little more, dum dum

In my white, mink pink
Cigarettes (¿from the store
I’m makin’ all em’ rich
Do you wander to the shore
Dum dum
Wander to the shore,?) dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone
Of the pink sahara
Cause I’m on the scene
Yeah, I’m on the scene

I’m a bad jazz singer
Givin’ You the finger
No matter what you linger
Cause you like me even when I’m mean
I’m the queen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You’ll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You’ll be forever changed
[x4]
