He's my drugstore cowboy,
Italian alloy,
Classical American.

And I'm America's Sweetheart,
Cute, delicious, sweet tart,
Sipping on my diet coke,
Singin' in the trailer park.

He likes my jeans tight (Yeah)
He likes me mean, right (Right)
He likes my long hair
Corset, heels high.

I'm born to kill,
Strip for success,
I'm his, sweet mess.
Do you love me? Yes, yes!
Hell, yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire,
And I'm what you desire,
Like a siren in the night (Don't niro-niro)
Baby you's a man on a wire,
Risking all that you've got,
For the love of your life (You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl.

He's the get rich quick type
Mafioso hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him!

I'm the bad girl, next door.
Baby's always wantin' more,
Buyin' diamond jewelry,
Take me to the Jersey Shore.

He like my mink white (White)
We go out all night (Night)
We're living off the grid
Shining in the crime life.

We were born to kill,
Best of the best
The new, Wild West
Honey put on that party dress
Hell, yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire,
And I'm what you desire,
Like a siren in the night (Don't niro-niro)
Baby you's a man on a wire,
Risking all that you've got,
For the love of your life (You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl.

Me and my baby planning world domination
Together taking over our fair nation.

'Cause we're born to kill
Keepin' it fresh.
Gold chain, white mesh,
Fame is the name of the game, yes yes! (Yes, yes, yes, yes)

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire,
I'm what you desire,
Like a siren in the night (Don't niro-niro)
Baby you's a man on a wire,
Risking all that you've got,
For the love of your life (You're my hero, hero)
[x2]

Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl.

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire,
I'm what you desire,
Like a siren in the night (Don't niro-niro)
Baby you's a man on a wire,
Risking all that you've got,
For the love of your life (You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl,
Let me be your dangerous girl.
