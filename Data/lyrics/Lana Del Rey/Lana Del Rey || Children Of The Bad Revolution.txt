
Take me in your fast car Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you're driving
Doesn't care I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every lie

I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's their only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so arty
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
'Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's their only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

Run for our lives
They got all our chains
Let's hope that we merge
Create our own games
DJ's, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
They're celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's our only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's our only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are, what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free
We're gonna get free
