
They call me firecracker cause I sparkle, sparkle
Ah, they call me sunshine in the dark I glow like neon gold, neon gold
On the dance floor, dance floor
I'm your midnight answer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
I put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, sin sin

They call me firecracker 'cause I'm danger, danger
They say that I'm like crack because my taste will change ya
I'm neon gold, I'm neon gold
Go-go dancer, dancer
Light me up that cancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
I'm in it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, spin spin

You know I love you, right?
What else you looking for?
I am the go-go girl next door, door
I won't take no, no
For an answer
I'm in to win it
Let me be your private dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot in the night club pole
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
