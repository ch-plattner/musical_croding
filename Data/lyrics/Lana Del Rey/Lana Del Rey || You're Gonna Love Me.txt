Jerry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea,
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel.
And that’s because I have a bad mind,
And I have gold in my veins.
But he says I got the purest heart
That he’s ever seen, oh.

What God give me a brain for?
He won’t help me use it.
What God give me a plan for,
If he won’t help me do it?

You’re gonna love me,
I’m gonna make you.
You’re gonna love me,
I’m gonna make you.

Well I can tell that you’re the type 
To never trust a beauty queen.
But I was never voted for nothing, 
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody,
Never ever gave myself away.
But even when I’m funny,
You think I’m acting, so I say:

What God give me a brain for,
If he won’t let me use it?
What’d God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it.

You’re gonna love me,
I’m gonna have to make you.
You’re gonna love me,
I’m gonna make you.

You say that you don’t want to be hypnotized,
But baby I, I don’t want to hypnotize you.
There’s nothing from you that I want to take.
I just want to be like you.
(Maybe love you just a little bit),
Please. Oh, oh, oh

Jim, I dedicate this whole album to you.
You told me to get my way,
That’s exactly what I’m gonna do.

I’m going to strike out, right now.
I’m striking out right now with this song.
But I can’t help myself;
I can’t do right for long,
You know that.

What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it.
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for,
He never lets me do it.

But you're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
You gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
