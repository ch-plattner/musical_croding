Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinking, then you're not playin" 
But you've got the music, you've got the music in you
Don't you,

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving you for the music,
You for the music it's true, It's true

I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire,
I'm feeling like there's no one else that brings me higher than higher,
Te deseo careno, boy it's you I desire,
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging,
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up,
On the balcony and I'm singing,
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
hes crazy y cubano como yo l-love
On the balcony and I'm sayin'
move baby move baby I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love
(I'm in love, I'm in love)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons,
their silver starlets, their queens of Saigons,
but you've got the music, you've got the music in you, don't you,

You pull me close, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch,
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much,
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive I'm a lush,
Hold me close and you say, hush baby hush,

I can see my baby swinging,
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up,
On the balcony and I'm singing,
Ooh baby, Ooh baby I'm in love,
I can see my sweet boy swaying,
he's crazy y cubano como yo l-love,
On the balcony and I'm saying,
move baby, move baby I'm in love,

I can see my baby singing,
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up,
on the balcony and I'm singing,
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love,
I can see my sweet boy swaying,
He's crazy y cubano como yo l-love,
On the balcony and I'm saying,
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love,

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
