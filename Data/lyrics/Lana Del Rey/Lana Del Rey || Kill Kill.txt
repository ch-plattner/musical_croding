Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going
To leave you?

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
All our love's flying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Tell me about Brian and his girl
Do I know, Brian is going to meet you?
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
As stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
All our love flying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Want to
Make it fun
Don't trust
Anyone

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can...
