
You're hot for God, but we all got a,
Hunch that maybe you've gone astray.
Control yourself, but it's so hard,
When you can look so good on Sunday.

I know he knows,
That I know what he's thinkin',
I know he knows.
I know he knows,
That what he's doin' is wrong,
But I just tell him "go on,

Sing a sad song."
My baby has an eye,
For pretty things, pretty things.
He thinks that little girls,
Are butterflies and cuts their wings.

Sicko, psycho, sicko,
But he's my beau.
Puts them on a rollercoaster,
Lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Boy, you've been, catchin' butterflies,
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin, me up if you like,
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby.
You give me butterflies,
You're catchin' butterflies.
You give me butterflies,
I'm fluttering, fluttering high.

You're hard to trap but boy you got,
A secret that you cannot betray.
He likes it hot, you're burnin' up,
But baby boy your secret is safe.

I know he know,
That I know what he's thinkin'
I know he know.
I know he know,
That what he's teachin' is wrong,
But, honey, this preacher's song,
Has got me too far-gone.

My baby has an eye,
For girls who sing, girls who sing.
He's lucky I'm the type,
That's his thing, that's his thing.

Sicko, psycho, sicko,
But he's my beau.
Dresses up in rings and rollers,
Poses as a Holy Roller!

Boy, you've been, catchin' butterflies,
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up, if you like,
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby.

You give me butterflies,
You're catchin' butterflies.
You give me butterflies,
I'm fluttering, fluttering high.

These butterflies are in a,
Golden cage, safe and bound.
I puts on "Lola" by The Kinks,
And he dances round.

And he's so happy that his,
Feet don't even touch the ground.
I'm in love 'cause I was lost,
And now I'm finally found.

Boy, you've been, catchin' butterflies,
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can hit me up if you like,
Pin-up in a lonely sky, baby.

You give me butterflies,
You're catchin' butterflies.
You give me butterflies,
I'm fluttering, fluttering,
Fluttering, fluttering,
Fluttering, fluttering,
Fluttering, fluttering.
