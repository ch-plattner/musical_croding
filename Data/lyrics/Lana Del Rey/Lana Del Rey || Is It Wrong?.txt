Stalking you has sort of become like my occupation
I used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock-star now I'm having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Let's get it on, check one two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin' around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right

It gets so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, take over domination
Used to be so simple, never wantin' and never wishin'
But now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission

I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on, check one two
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin' around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right

A funny little thing about love is that you're blind of the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more, it isn't right but
You can't stop

You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin' around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin' around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
