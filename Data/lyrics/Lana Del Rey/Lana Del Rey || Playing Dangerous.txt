Everybody knows that I'm a good girl, officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
(Well) I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my night gown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

Looking at me, then suddenly,

I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane,
I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong,
Playing a dangerous game,
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer.
You can ask me anything you want,
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger.
Well, that's interesting.
Have you ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher,
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting,
Don't you think?

Then suddenly he's uncuffing me

I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane,
I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong,
Playing a dangerous game,
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.

If you can't stand the heat,
Then stay out of the fire,
You might get what you, desire.
Boy, love is strange,
Sometimes it makes you crazy,
It can burn or break you.

If you can't stand the heat,
Then stay out of the fire,
You might get what you, desire.
Boy, love is strange,
Sometimes it makes you crazy,
It can burn or break you down.

I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane,
I'm in love, I'm in love,
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong,
Playing a dangerous game,
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.
