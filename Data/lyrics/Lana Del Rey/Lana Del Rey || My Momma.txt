My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so

I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I don't know no hoodlum and you don't pass the test

I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Oh, baby, I'm standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now

My momma say that it was wrong to see you
I lie just to meet you, I lie to get in
And my momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she'd ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along
