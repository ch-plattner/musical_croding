Little boy,
Livin' without you won't be easy to do
Little boy,
you are the love of my life
And if you don't want to talk to me,
well, then I think that's alright

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love,
my love

Knowing you are hurt inside,
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my

When I ask what I can do,
you say,
"Remember me the way I was six months ago"
Oh, I could do so much more for you,
you know,
I can make you well
if you just asked me to

Oh,
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love

I'll do anything for you, or for him,
or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
always

Think of you on quiet nights,
at traffic lights
and every highway 
And I get a little scared sometimes
when everyone I meet
I find has a friend

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love,
my love
