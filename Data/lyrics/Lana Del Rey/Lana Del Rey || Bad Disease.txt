Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, if it's less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have, a feeling real bad
I'm final if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to cry, to thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?
