
Oh, oh, come on come on
I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
My bad lines look paradise next to you.
I hope I remember you just like that
Looking fresh to death in your ball cap
You'll say you'll tap it like a high hat
Your stupid lines are like dynamite.

The future's looking bright as black tonight
You told me that our love can not endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Boy, I don't know a thing, but of this I'm sure
There's nowhere on this Earth I'd rather be
But in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly
Te-television heaven with you
Singing in New York, to Nirvana songs
With nothing but that t-t-television on
Kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that empty TV on
A television Heaven with you.

I wonder if you think of me like this
I'm your fire escape like a hot mess
You say you're beautiful, but hopeless
Come on inside of your crazy child, look at you
I promise I'll think of you as the king
Putting' Corleone like you're soaring. 
It's Cosa Nostra cause its our thing 
I'm aging mine like a thousand times.
Lucy's in the sky where it flies tonight
Heaven knows I try hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong I wanna do right
And if you ask again I'll say I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I'd rather be
But in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly
Te-television heaven with you
Singing in New York, to Nirvana songs
With nothing but that t-t-television on
Kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that empty TV on
A television Heaven with you.

Stay up tonight, uh
Turn up the light
It feels so right
Baby, your a vision in blue
Stay up tonight, uh
Turn up the light
It feels so right
Watching television with you!

There's nowhere on this Earth I'd rather be
But in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly
Te-television heaven with you
Singing in New York, to Nirvana songs
With nothing but that t-t-television on
Kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that empty TV on
A television Heaven with you.
