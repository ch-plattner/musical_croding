
Oh, say can you see my stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys and look at the bars
Night time is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The night time is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired and send you to Mars
Night time is almost ours
