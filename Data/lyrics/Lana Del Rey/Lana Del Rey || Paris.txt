Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did
When we was first dating

You're sitting in your office dreaming of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walking home from school my thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight and take off to a different place
Don't tell my daddy why, gotta get on that plane and just fly

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris, we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)

I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go out while we're young
Cause one day we will want to rewind...

Our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris, make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Wanna go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris, we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)

Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singing about the Sacré-Cœur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars
We are, we are dreaming... of Paris

You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy

Take me to Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris, make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Wanna go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris

(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)

Baby say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did
When we was first dating
