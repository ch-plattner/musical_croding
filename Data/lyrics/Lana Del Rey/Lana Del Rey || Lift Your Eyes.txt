
Should have let me know
that I never had a chance at all
I could never be what you wanted

should have let me know
that you're still thinking about her 
should have told me you was haunted

sometimes I wonder why
why I even bother
tryin' to pull you out, boy

should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

lift your eyes
just a little higher
just a little higher
lift those eyes
and look into mine
because I can guide you
I can guide you 
lift your eyes

I know that you're scared to death 
running out of breath

but I can hold you, hold you

should have let me know 
that you work around the clock
could have tried to live harder
yeah

should have let me know
that you're afraid to love me
afraid of looking like a liar

sometimes I wonder why, 
why I even ask you 
but I do

lift your eyes
just a little higher
just a little higher
lift those eyes
look into mine
because I can guide you, I can guide you 

lift those eyes
lift your eyes

I know that you're scared to death
running out of breath

I can hold you, hold you
