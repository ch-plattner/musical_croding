
One day my hoops will be made of diamond's
and my knuckles made of real gold.
I'll spend my days gettin' high wit all my friends 
in the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood.

Summer rise I'm a super nova
body electric and I dance like Morrison,
when the night begins baby comes alive again.

In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
I'm alive again,
I'm alive again.

One day I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz,
singing opera on Bel Air road.
hair to my ass we'll be flying in the wind
we'll be shootin' heroin and speedballs.

See the sea I'm a supernova,
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin,
when the sun descends I dive into the waves again.

In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
I'm alive again,
I'm alive again.

Oh my ca-can ya' see me
oh oh my heart beating fast,
I can feel it chasing in the speed lights, 
I was built last.
Oh oh, ca-can ya' feel that,
oh oh my heart shaking fast,
I can feel that you're the one for me,
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last.

In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
In Hollywood,
I'm alive again,
I'm alive again,
I'm alive again,
I'm alive again.
