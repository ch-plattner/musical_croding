Motel six, slow gin fizz
Singing in the lobby
Do the sunset twist

I can do it, you can do it
Swing them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous!

Fellas, if you want to
Get the invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up
And pick up the liquor
Gone is your charm
Well come on, going to get her
Baby, it's a fair game

Ladies if you really
Want to reign them suckers
Line up them lips and
Plump up them pluckers
Baby, that's the only
Way to get them other fuckers
Tell me what you want, tell

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Baby, if you really
Want to know my secret
Come a little closer
Kitty, promise you'll keep it
Knew a little nearer there
Whisper you need it
Under the fairy lights

Men'll like a woman
Who just don't need them
Sweeter than cherry pie
But we'll treat them
Meaner than dirt
They deserve to be hurt
Do they realize what
You're worth, worth, worth?

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Maybe we can go down to 7-11
Drive down the drag in your Pontiac heaven
Baby you can buy me Diet Mountain Dew
And we'll get right down to it
Me and you

Laying on your hood like a flat bed truck
In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
We saw their car from a mile away
And it's slowing

You say it's a motel dance let's get going!

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Motel six, slow gin fizz
Singing in the lobby
Do the sunset twist

I can do it, you can do it
Swing them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous!

Motel six, slow gin fizz
Singing in the lobby
Do the sunset twist

I can do it, you can do it
Move them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous!

Motel six, slow gin fizz
Singing in the lobby
Do the sunset twist

I can do it, you can do it
Move them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous!
