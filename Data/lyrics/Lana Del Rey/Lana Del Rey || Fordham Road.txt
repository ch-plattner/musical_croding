30 blocks to Fordham Road
That's a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could

The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay,
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.

I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee,
There's a place on Valentine that still charge ninety cents

I keep on walking in the daytime, and in my eyes it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
â€˜Cause that's when all the stars come out

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay,
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.

it's the greatest
it's the greatest day

it's the greatest
it's the greatest day

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.
