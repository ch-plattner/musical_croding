Living down by Wayamaya bay.
We had a few friends,
Never thought it would end.

I remember an all white day,
With eight story waves,
He said your eyes are grey,
(Careful).

We were living on Cody Lane,
Go carolling
Sun memories

Drivin’ in our Mercury down to Wayamaya,
Drivin’ in our Mercury.
Drivin’ in our Mercury down to Wayamaya,
Drivin’ in our Mercury.

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names
To Lana and Ray
We be up to the sun rosé
I’m in gold lamé
Your pink floral haze

Drivin’ in a Mercury down to Wayamaya
Drivin’ in a Mercury
Drivin’ in a Mercury down to Wayamaya
Drivin’ in a Mercury

Waikiki cove, Waikiki cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki cove 
Waikiki cove, Waikiki cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki cove
