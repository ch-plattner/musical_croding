
What an unusual name you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh, what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive sign on his arm, oh, my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he knows she'll never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said, how did I know you so well?
Why am I not surprised?
He said, baby, go to hell
And that was the demise, of their love

Don't ever pick up the man
If you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you
Have a history of being a loving fool

So, that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need

I do not know him so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh, tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
My love
