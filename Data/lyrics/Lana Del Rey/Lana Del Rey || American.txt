Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like, tall, tan, driving 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like, "You're so pretty."
"Springsteen is the king, don't you think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing."

Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, g-get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey put on that party dress
Like Oh oh oh ohooh
Oh oh oh ohoowoow

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, you spin me round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh

Everybody wants to go fast, but they can't compare
I don't really want the rest, only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying, but I'm praying for you

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, you spin me round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Oh oh ohoh oh oh oh ohoohh
Like an American
Oh oh ohoh oh oh oh ohoohh
Like an American
Oh oh ohoh oh oh oh ohoohh
Like an American
Oh oh ohoh oh oh oh ohoohh
Like an American
