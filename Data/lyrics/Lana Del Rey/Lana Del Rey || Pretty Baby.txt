Then I won't touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're going to want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't want to keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Aren't you going to miss me?
Honey, I'll miss you
I just want to kiss you
Tonight

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave
