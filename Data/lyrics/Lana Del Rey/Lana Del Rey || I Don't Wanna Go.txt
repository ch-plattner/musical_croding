
He don't like no small things, 
Even riding around on tall dreams
 I don't wanna go 
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
 In his soft leather, in his blue jeans

 He got away, baby, he got away, oh, baby
 He got away with his words.
 They'd be like diamonds and pearls, 
They'd be like diamonds and pearls, 
He gives to his little favorite girls

 I don't wanna go, go home
 I don't wanna go, go home 
Baby, tonight
 Baby, tonight

 He don't like no spotlight, 
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

 He got away, oh, baby, he got away, oh, baby,
 He got away with those words.
 They'd be like diamonds and pearls, 
They'd be like diamonds and pearls, 
He gives to his little favorite girl

 I don't wanna go, go home
 I don't wanna go, go home 
Baby, tonight 
Baby, tonight

 Loving you isn't right,
 Black leather won't like the giving
 Loving you isn't right,
 It's original sin

 I don't wanna go, go home
 I don't wanna go, go, home 
Baby, tonight 
Baby, tonight

 I feel like I can do anything, 
Like I can do anything, 
Like I can do anything that I like 
I feel like I can do anything,
 Like I can do anything, 
Like I can do anything tonight
 Baby, tonight 
Tonight
