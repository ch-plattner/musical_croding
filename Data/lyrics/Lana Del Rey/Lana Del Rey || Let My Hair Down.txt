You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down
You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down

You get me moving like no one can
Got me moving like no one can
Got me moving like no one can
You got me dancing up the stairs now man
You got me dancing up the stairs now
You got me dancing up the stairs now man
You got me dancing uá¹— the stairs now

Get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can

You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down
You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down

You got me burning in my soul now man
You got me burning in my soul now
You got me burning in my soul now man
You got me burning in my soul now

You get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can
