
You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue.
And I, I think that you,
I think you’re so cool babe
Loving everything you do.

You say we’re gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway.

Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down.
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown.
Gonna make a getaway, top down.

You, know what I want.
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip-gloss.
How, you get so hot
You’re making me crazy
Hoping you’ll never stop.

You say that we were meant to be.
We’ll be together finally.
Flying around and I’m finally free, oh.

Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, finally gonna get away, top down.
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown.

We’re on our way [x4]

Why, did I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss.
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble’s all over now
Because you’re my man.

You don’t know what you’ve done to me.
You’re heavier than heavenly.
Life on the run has set me free, me free now.

We’re on our way...

You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss.
