
Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?
