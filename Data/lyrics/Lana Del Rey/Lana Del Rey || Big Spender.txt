I could see you were a man of distinction, a real big spender
Good lookin’, so refined
Say, wouldn’t you like to know what’s goin’ on

(Big spender)

[Verse 1]
SM your boy Smiler iced out
Paid da cost to floss what’s the price now?
Fresh out the gutter, the city begged me to rep it
Cuzzie I came with collateral, getters get me so f’ it I’ma (spender)

I plug money in harrods,
I’m bugs bunny wit carrots,
Diamonds on my neck n my arm blingin’ with class,
Those that always speculated are now beginning to ask are you a (spender)

If it’s mines what is it?
If it shines what is it?
If ur coming at me with goods and you’re tryna pitch it

Cash rules, my flash jewels are monumental
Brass fools just act cool with what credentials?
It’s second nature, I floss n get it for real
Black n yellow diamonds all in my chain I’m definitely I’ll

Strong broads are on fours to see who
Concords and tom fords, I’m GQ
Gucci belling me “smiler come in to preview
All the ish that came today and besides that, we wanna see you” I’m a (spender)

English kid, distinguished, talk is cheap
Linguistics, bling bling ish, noughts and g’s,
Brushing shoulders with movers, shakers n bosses
Call if it’s related to getting wagers or profits, I’m a spender

Let me get right to the point
I don’t pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender

[Verse 3]
Cashcow, I splash out on things nice,
Cash out, won’t back down or think twice
Hit the boutiques, cop some for my honey too
Repertoire impressive, you comprehending that I’m a true (spender)

The streets knows I keep dough,
Lace you with peeptoes and neat clothes,
How better could it get, competition are bluffing
F’ing with the boy wonder I’ll leave you wanting for nothing, I’m a (spender)

Ain’t nuttin that no dude can show you,
Trips to Florida, know food in Nobu,
Keys to convertibles that I place in ur palm
Links of London and the Tiffany that I place on your arm, I’m a (spender)

Big stones, and cribs, homes, the high-life
Big shows and whips, those that I like,
When I draw for the Visa leave me alone, I get to swiping
F the prices I’m in a league of my own I’m a spender

[Hook:]
Let me get right to the point
I don’t pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender
