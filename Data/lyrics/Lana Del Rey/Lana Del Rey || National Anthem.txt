[Music video prelude:]
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, Mr. President
Happy Birthday to you
Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with US Steel and our problems by the ton
We thank you so much
Everybody

Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?

I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to "be cool" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of Chevron

He said to "be cool" but
I'm already coolest
I said to “get real",
“Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?”

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower, hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress

I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and Danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

[Music video spoken ending:]
And I remember when I met him.
It was so clear that he was the only one for me.
We both knew right away.
And as the years went on things got more difficult,
We were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay,
Tried to remember what we had in the beginning.
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric, and everybody knew him
When he walked in every woman's head turned.
Everyone stood up to talk to him.
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way, I understood him.
And I loved him, I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him, I love him.
