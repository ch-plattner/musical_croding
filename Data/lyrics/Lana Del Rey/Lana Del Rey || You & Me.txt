Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the page
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos they were glistening
Its been so long since someone made me different

[Chorus:]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive,
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

Gonna’ light up the skies, I can see it
You’re God’s favorite’s child, boy believe it
Tryin hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanine
Diamonds and getting blazed
Tattoos still magnificent
No longer high, but you’re not very different

[Chorus:]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Baby
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive,
It’s just you and the sun,
Its just you and the sun now, baby, baby, baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, insṗired,
Make me higher and higher

[Chorus:]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive,
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun baby
