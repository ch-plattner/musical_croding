
Pin up girls at the roller derby,
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey.
American flags; blue, blue streamers.
Everybody's laughing, the crowd is cheering.

Baby, I've become someone,
Baby, I've become,
Baby, I've become someone,
Not of this world.
Hey, yeah, yeah.
Not of this world.
Hey, yeah, yeah.

Dance at night back in Alabama.
Christmas lights on my teal green trailer.
American flags; blue, blue streamers,
All the men are watching, the crowd is screaming.

Baby, I've become someone,
Baby, I've become,
Baby, I've become someone,
Not of this world.
Hey, yeah, yeah.
Not of this world.
Hey, yeah, yeah.

Prizes, prizes, a diamond tiara.
Hereâ€™s to the girl with the blue mascara.
I have a disco ball mind, 
Lights flashing all of the time.
I have a disco ball mind, 
I want to die, I want to die.
I want to die, I want to die.
Ooh, uh, ooh.

Baby, I've become someone,
Baby, I've become,
Baby, I've become someone,
Not of this world.
Hey, yeah, yeah.
Not of this world.
Ooh-ooh, mm.
