
You know sometimes I think God's playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing,
Trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon and missed than me

It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting, losing game, and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man
Do I understand?
No, stop!
I don't want to hear another word about your "why not's" I bought
You bullshit it all before, now, you trying to sell me more, babe

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired 

I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey, ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad
You say you were glad to see me shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am
Smiling but I ain't happy

A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing I can choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired 

Oh, my Super God,
I can't turn off my mind,
It's like a ticking time bomb trying to kill me from inside
Haunting me day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

I've felt this way before, I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right, but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad
I can't stop
I keep running 'round the same town, knocking you down
I'm fucked!
How can I get out when there's no where to go for miles around?

A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing I can choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
Tired, oh!
