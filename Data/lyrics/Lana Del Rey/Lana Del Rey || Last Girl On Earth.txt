Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamond rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

Whoa [x4]

Chariots of gold
I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto,
I'm a super power
Now they call me the tornado
I've got roses in my hair
I belly dance and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

No one lives forever,
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on Earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

Whoa [x4]

Chariots of gold,
I'm sittin', sippin' cherry cola,
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me, if I was older.
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller coaster,
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now.

No one lives forever,
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy ruling all the world without love.
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now.

No one lives forever,
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
