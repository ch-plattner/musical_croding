A dead man lying in the road
Have you ever heard his best friend?
His best friend say you'd better go
Before you get fined
Or else you'll do time

Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny
Its all about money, money
Well alright

Have you ever seen an old man?
An old man living all alone
Have you ever heard an old man?
An old man hear the way he moans?
Because he's so tired
Because he just got fired

Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny
Its all about money, money
Well alright

Lately I've been 
Feelin' like the world is weighing 
Down on me again
ahh ahh ahh ahh ooh

Have you ever seen a broke man
Seen a broke man begging for his life?
Have you ever heard a broke man
Heard a broke man, heard the pain & strife?
In his one line plea, in his dull edged knife

He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright
Well alright
Well alright
Well alright
