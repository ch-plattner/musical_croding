What ya doin'?
I been hula-hoopin' waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators,
Don't know what you're tryin' to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen,
You should hear me sing sing,
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two,
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger,
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

It doesn't really matter what you say,
'Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, no.
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Hi ya honey
How's it goin'?,
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah,
You're shakin', makin' music and you're famous,
Deep down you're the same girl I knew
She said, I know what they say about you,
I know that they think you're crazy,
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say,
'Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now.
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters,
Chasin' all that paper,
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger,
Money is my saviour,
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be,
And I'm dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

It doesn't really matter what you say,
'Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now.
When I'm hot, I'm hot
