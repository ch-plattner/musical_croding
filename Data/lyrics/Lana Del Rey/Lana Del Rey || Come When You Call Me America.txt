Come when you call me,
Come when you call me.

Just like you wanna,
Know, who, what,
Just like you said,
Yourself, night.

I can do whatever I want,
You can do whatever you.
It's just like I always wanted,
Just like I always knew.

Riding my time,
Have a night life,
Have a night life.

Head to head,
Gun to gun,
Now we're gonna,
Have some fun.

Come when you call me,
Come when you call me.

This why I wanna,
Know, who, what,
Just like you said,
Yourself, night.

Riding my time,
Have a night life,
(Have a night life).

I know what you,
Been looking for.
I think I got,
All that and more.

I think I know,
What you been trying,
Saying "everybody,
wants a little time".

Come when you call me,
Come when you.

(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

This why I wanna,
Know, who, what,
Just like you said,
Yourself, night.

(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

I can do whatever I want,
You can do whatever you.
This is like I always wanted,
Just like I always knew.

(Tell me a story, daddy).

Come when you call me,
Come when you.

(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

You can say whatever,
You gonna say about me.
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).
You can say whatever,
You gonna say about me.
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

You can say whatever,
You gonna say about me.
(I like you, I like),
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

Hey-ah, ooh,
Hey-ah, ooh.

Stay in your room,
Get in your bed,
Maybe you can get me,
Inside your head.

(A-M-E-R-I-C-A).

(Tell me a story, daddy).
