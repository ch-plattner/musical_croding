
Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "Be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star I've ever seen
And I never dreamed I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful, like Cleopatra,
But you're the king, too, so I would say, "Back at ya!"
I'd flip my hair and make you stare and put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life and 'bout my very cherry-bomb

And even then I knew that we were something serious,
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio the Sirius
I see you in the hall like "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town,
Let me do it right now, baby.
Dancing till dark, staying forever young,
Let's get out of this place, 'cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland.

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place, now, baby,
I'm not crazy.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing till we see the sun
So far we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen and I'd be so happy that I could die.

You used to call yourself the Don and call me Queen Diana
You always made me blush and say, "Shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You play me Biggie Smalls and then my first Nirvana song
So even then when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period

I see you in the hall like "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town,
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place, 'cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby,
I'm not crazy.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say that all I want is to have fun
And get away for rainy days.
I know that they think I've come undone,
But I'm in love... I wanna run, run, run away.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town,
Let me do it right now, baby.
Dancing till dark, staying forever young,
Let's get out of this place, 'cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland.

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby,
I'm not crazy.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?
