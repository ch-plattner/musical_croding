I look for you in magazines
I look for you in magazines
I look for you in magazines
I'm taking off my wedding ring

I gave you everything
I gave you everything

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

I'm going back to Arbor Dean
I'm going back to Arbor Dean
I'm going back to Arbor Dean
Where when I was a beauty queen

It wasn't anything
It wasn't anything

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

I'm waving on the silver screen
I'm waving on the silver screen
I'm waving on the trampoline
I'm waving on the silver screen

The film is fading, look at me
The film is fading, look at me
The film is fading, look at me
The film is fading, look at me, look at me

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights

Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
