I was addicted to you but I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it huh

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
This is so like you I said
Put yourself on back to bed

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, pray you'll start breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him till the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him till the morning

I was addicted to you didn't wanna blow it
You were a d√¨ck with your crew
Always on the road

You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out nothing left
Burned yourself out nothing left

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, pray you'll start breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him till the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him till the morning

Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame colored paradise for you darling
But death doesn't come with a warning

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, pray you'll start breathing
My baby's on his last life darling
I'm staying with him till the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him till the morning

(my baby's on his last life darling)
(gonna stay around till morning)

(my baby's on his last life darling)
(I've got to stick around till morning)
