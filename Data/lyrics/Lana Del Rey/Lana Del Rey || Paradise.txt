What?

Love you like I never loved anyone
Keep me burning hot like the red red sun
Want you like I never wanted anyone
You give it to me fast like free and fun

Every time it's you
It feels like I'm in summer
I don't know why
Maybe 'cause you're so cool
And keep it on the real like sugar sugar fly

Boy you're sweet like sugarcane
Make me feel alive again

I'm going down down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La love lick you like vanilla ice
(Tie you up and make you crazy)

Shut up
Give me what you got
You can rock my hot super sonic pow
We're going down down, take you down to paradise

Want you like I never wanted anyone
Got a face like God
And a bod like drawn
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone
'Cause you keep it really rough
Like oh my God

Every time it's you
I can tell it's forever
I don't know how
And even if it's not
You know I couldn't  stop
You make my heart go pow

Coming down like pouring rain
Make my feel alive again

I'm going down down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La love lick you like vanilla ice
(Tie you up and make you crazy)

Sh-sh-sh-sh-Shut up
Give me what you got
You can rock my hot super sonic pow
We're going down down, take you down to paradise

Uh, how do you like that baby? [giggle]

Down down, take you down to paradise
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
(Down down. take you down to paradise)
Down down, take you down to paradise
Hey hey hey hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey

(Ooo)
Hey hey hey 
Dope
(Ooo)
hey hey hey 
That's sick
(Ooo)
hey hey hey hey hey
Dope
hey hey hey hey hey
That's sick 
[giggle]
(Ooo)

Shut up
Give me what you got
You can rock my hot super sonic pow

I'm going down down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La love lick you like vanilla ice
(Tie you up and make you crazy)

Sh-sh-sh-sh-Shut up
Give me what you got
You can rock my hot super sonic pow
We're going down down, take you down to paradise
