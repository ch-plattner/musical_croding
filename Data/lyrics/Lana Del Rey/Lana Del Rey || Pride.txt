
You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful

It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride
