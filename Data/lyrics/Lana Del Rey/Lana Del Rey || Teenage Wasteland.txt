Boy, it's late, walk me home,
Put your hand in mine.
At the gates stop and say,
"Be my Valentine."

You are by far,
The brightest star,
I've ever seen,
And I never dreamed,
I'd be so happy,
That I could die.

Used to say that I was beautiful,
Like Cleopatra,
But you the king too so I would say,
"Back at'cha!"

I flip my hair and make you stare,
And put my make-up on,
And make up stories 'bout my life,
And put on Very Cherry Bomb.

And even then I knew that we were,
Something serious,
That you would dominate my thoughts of,
Radio Two serials.

I'd see you in the hall like,
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like,
"Let's go, let's go!"

Let me take you out of this town,
Let me do it right now, baby,
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young.
Let's get out of this place,
'Cause you're starting to waste,
Within this teenage wasteland.

You will never see my face,
If you don't get me out of this place,
Now, baby, I'm not crazy.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me,
You're my only one.
Watching television, kissin',
Till we see the sun.

So far, we are,
Safe in the dark.
And I never dreamed,
That I'd be the queen,
And I'd be so happy,
That I could die.

You used to call yourself "the Don",
And me "Queen Diana",
You always make me blush I say,
"Shut up, boy, you bananas."

You pull my hair and push me down,
And chase me, make me run,
You play me Biggie Smalls and then,
My first Nirvana song.

So even then when no one's friends,
Were really serious,
I knew you loved me by the way,
You looked in second period.

I'd see you in the hall like,
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like,
"Let's go, let's go!"

I know that they say
That all I want,
Is to have fun,
And get away for rainy days.

I know that they think,
I've come undone,
But I'm in love,
I wanna run, run, run away.

I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town,
Let me do it right now, baby,
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young.
Let's get out of this place,
'Cause you're starting to waste,
Within this teenage wasteland.

You will never see my face,
If you don't get me out of this place,
Now, baby, I'm not crazy.
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?
