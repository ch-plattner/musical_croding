Being a mistress on the side,
It might not appear to fools like you.
Creeping around on the side
Might not be somethin' you would do.

But you haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen him.

He's got the fire and he walks with fame,
He's got the fire and he talks with fame.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.

Being a bad bitch on the side,
Might not appeal to fools like you.
We been around while he gets high,
It might not be somethin' you would do.

But you haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen my man,
You haven't seen him.

He's got the fire and he walks with fame,
He's got the fire and he talks with fame.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.

Watch what you say to me,
Careful who you're talkin' to.
Watch what you say to me,
Careful who you're talkin' to.

I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire.

He's got the fire and he walks with fame,
He's got the fire and he talks with fame.

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me so sad, girl.

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl.
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl.
