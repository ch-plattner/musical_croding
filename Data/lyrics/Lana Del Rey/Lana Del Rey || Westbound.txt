
You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you till you left
So you went away

Where did you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With the song
You like to write about all of your problems
The damning songs because you think it was often
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must I come to this?
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Heaven know how to fight
I guess I want
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you couldn't
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about
