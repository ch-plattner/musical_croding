
Just like you said
It's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty
For them no more

I can talk what I want, how I wanna
I can talk what I want, how I wanna
I don't have to talk taste for you, mama
No, no

Ray, ray, ray
Raise me up

It's the voodoo, mississippi south
69 million stars
Birds are flying out of my mouth
Spirits creeping in my yard

Hold my head, it's tilting back
Something dancing me around
Putting crystals on my neck
Lifting my feet off the ground

Ray, ray, ray
Raise me up

Oh, see, what you've done now
Oh, me, just what I'm talking about
Oh, see, what you've done now
Ohh, me, it's what I'm talking bout

Pick me up in a pickup truck
Roll down, you've got it going on
Lemme talk on your CB, what?
Lemme play with your new shotgun

Ray, ray, ray
Raise me up
