And there's me,
Little queen of the stage, yeah.

One the stars, call creator.
Hail the king of the industry players.
Take off your business suit,
Sitting in your lap for my interview.

Pick me up in your white Lamborghini.
London town,
You'll watch out,
While I'm singing.
Glamorous on the stage,
Boy believe me.
Keep your girl back.
No competing.
Eying you from across the room,
Watching me.
Wa-watching you.

Wanna be your soldier.

Nothing's for free,
It's money and technology.
Together we'd be deadly.
