
Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid? 
Are you at the archive watching television? 
Did you leave for Battery with your weed? 
In your leather looking like Greg Kinnear

Are you still the king of rock n roll,  babe? 
Do you miss hearing me sing
Callin' me Lana

And did you take your run today,  
On that west side highway?  

Do you miss your baby momma? 
Blue hydrangea 
Will my forever love never come back to me? 

Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet? 
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything 
Diamond horseshoe wedding ring
And tire light

Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?
