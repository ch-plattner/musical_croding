Standin' on the rooftop,
just out of earshot,
lookin' at this gangster guy.

Thinkin' he's a hot shot,
pourin me a big shot,
tryin' to get me drunk and high.

He wishes to be seen with me in his limousine,
and he says we'll have a real good time,
well xxo but I want you to know.

Every single night in the lights I'll be sparklin' bright,
I'm just a party girl, tryin to get my drinks for free from you.
If you hold me tight it's alright let the fire ignite,
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warnin' you.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
Came tonight to put my work on this play,
bringin' New York down to san tropez.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop, I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop.

Kissin on your white yacht 
show me what you got got
play a little rock n' roll.
on an island hop stop, maybe we should dot dot dot
(loose control)

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene cause I want a little danger boy,
well xxo but I told you so.

Every single night in the lights I'll be sparklin' bright,
I'm just a party girl, tryin to get my drinks for free from you.
If you hold me tight it's alright let the fire ignite,
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warnin' you.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
Came tonight to put my work on this play,
bringin' New York down to san tropez.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop, I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop.

It's not about us, just forget about us tonight.
Put your cigarette down baby light up the town,
Beside me.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
Came tonight to put my work on this play,
bringin' New York down to san tropez.

You don't get you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it.
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop, I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop.
