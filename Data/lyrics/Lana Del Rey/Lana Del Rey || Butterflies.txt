
We're sippin' cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper “Baby, love the way you look tonight”
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside

I know it seems you're all I'm wanting and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before
They say “I'll save you, save you”, but they never do

I think you know, I want to believe you
But in my heart I know that I'll leave you
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you
Or disappoints you

Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door, but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I made the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

Back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak into my window every night
“I wanna take you, take you to the world outside”

Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign
“I wanna take you, take you” and I didn't mind

And even though I didn't believe you
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you
Try to reach you, try to please you

Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run run run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door, but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I made the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be forever

I look around, there's no one above you
I think you know that I'll always love you
And baby, I'm bad, too, it's not just you
But I can't wait forever to trust you

Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door, but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I made the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
