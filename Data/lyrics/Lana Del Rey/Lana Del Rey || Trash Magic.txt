[Chorus:]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

I do my hair up, all high and wide
White flowers tied
Green swimming pool, pink flamingo, high Christmas lights
Blue bed spread and silver tinsel
My heart's delight

[Chorus]

Do you like my fake nails daddy?
Black palm tree, pink tiger stripes
Used to go to the Palm Parade, yeah
Where you'd buy me a slice of cherry pie
We didn't know much, just worked at night
Sweet trailer life
One, two

[Chorus]

He said, "Lana Rey, will you serve me lemonade?"
I said, "Yes Bill, I will, it's the day of the parade"
And you look even more handsome than you did the day that I left you"
How do you spend your nights, honey, still watching TV?
I long to be in your arms, honey
Come back to me, please

[Chorus]

All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
You know, mmm
Come on now, if you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
It's been a long time

Boy you wanna come to my motel honey?
Boy you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
(In my motel, honey)
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
(I said god-damn!)

[Chorus]
