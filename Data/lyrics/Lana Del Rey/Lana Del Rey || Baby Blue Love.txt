
I'm on the fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you.
I'll be outside pick me up after school, baby blue
Baby blue

Pour me up a bit of that liquid courage
Lookin' so good, like an Axl Rose
Cuttin' school listenin' to the techno music
Will we ever do right? God knows.
Me and Claudeen at the Seven Eleven
Smokin' in the back, in our mini skirts
Take us back to class, oh you look like heaven,
You say I'm so fine that it hurts.

I'm on the fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your Thunderbird, baby blue
Thunderbird, baby blue
Baby blue

Baby if you want to join our entourage
Paint your face on it here we go
Platinum, keepin' 'em so dangerous
Keeping it cool yeah, God knows.
Ridin' around town blue and leather
Walking them streets like the queen of hearts
Laughing at nothin' be alone together
Where your night ends, ours starts.

I'm on the fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your Thunderbird, baby blue
Thunderbird, baby blue
Baby blue

Will you or won't you do anything to have me?
Will you or won't you do anything to love me?
'Cause I'm a bad girl and I got a good plan
Bank across the street, you're a dangerous man
They ask you who's sweet, you tell them I am, baby blue, baby blue

I'm on the fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your Thunderbird, baby blue
Thunderbird, baby blue
Baby blue
