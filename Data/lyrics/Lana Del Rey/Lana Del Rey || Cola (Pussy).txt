
My pussy taste like Pepsi-Cola,
My eyes are wide like cherry pies.
I gots a taste for men who're older
It's always been, so it's no surprise.

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy (I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby.

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine.
I know your wife, that she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side [3x]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, baby.

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on skid row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy (I come alive, alive))
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride,
We can escape to the great sunshine.
I know your wife, that she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side [3x]

Drugs suck it up
Like vanilla icies
Don't treat me rough,
Treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck
Diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, that she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Come on, come on
Come on, baby

Whoa ah
My pussy taste like Pepsi-Cola
Oh... ah
My pussy taste like Pepsi-Cola
Oh....
My pussy taste like Pepsi-Cola
Oh... whoa...yeah
