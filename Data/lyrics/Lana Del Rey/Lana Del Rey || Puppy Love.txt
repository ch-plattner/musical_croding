It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls
I cook you breakfast, coffee on your desk, yes
I'ma burn your toast but baby I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the color TV, it was a new world
The Dick van Dyke show, we're Cher and Bono
The way I sing "I Got You Babe", makes you say, "Oh, no."
Cause you are the class president without Jackie O
And I'm singing "Happy birthday" like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (No)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen, in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose, golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack, a Veuve Clicquot and Ho Hos
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No)â€¨ (Two)
This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby (One)
This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
And if I call you on the telephone, I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love

It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby (One)
This is not a school girl crush (No)

(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby (One)
This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
