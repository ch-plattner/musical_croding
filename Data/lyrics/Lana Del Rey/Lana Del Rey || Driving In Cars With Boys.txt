
They say I'm wasting time, they said that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
Pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad,
[Another version:] They say I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad,
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
Oh, this drive by love got me crazy like a drug

[One version of the pre-chorus:]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends but I'm the one that they want
Miss America with the blue mascara on

[Another version of the pre-chorus:]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spend my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pick up truck
Come out late at night and baby picks me up
Tell 'em just drive on, d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

[One version of the pre-chorus:]
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in but I just have to go on
Miss America now I'm gone, baby, gone.

[Another version of the pre-chorus:]
I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go.
Now we know, baby, now we know

I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go.

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
Spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
