
You're breaking my heart tonight,
Kissing me hard, seeing Valentino stars tonight, 
I just wanna party tonight, 
We're breaking all the rules
But baby it all feels so right

You're breaking my heart tonight, 
Take me for a ride boy, 
Don't leave me on the side boy

Hey guy whatcha doing? I like you a lot
I been watching you, you're watching me. I think you're hot
Gold hoops, cherry pie, I'm the apple of his eye
Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace and yayo

I like, I like, I like this roller coaster ride (ride) 
Don't leave me on the side boy... 

You're breaking my heart tonight, 
Kissing me hard, seeing Valentino stars tonight,
I just wanna party tonight,
We're breaking all the rules
But baby it all feels so right

You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy, don't leave me on the side boy

Hey fly boy you cruising faster than the light, 
Bling is shining bright and you got lightening in your eyes (eyes)
Gold chains, kissing fly, leaning on your cool ride, 
Versailles, St. Tropez, lingerie and yayo

I like, I like, I like this roller coaster ride (ride) 
Don't leave me on the side boy... 

You're breaking my heart tonight, 
Kissing me hard, seeing Valentino stars tonight,

I know we fight, we go out every night
But what do you expect from a Hollywood lifestyle?
He says it's wrong, no baby boy it's right
Passion is a thing you cant buy, its hard to find

You're breaking my heart tonight, 
Kissing me hard, seeing Valentino stars tonight,
I just wanna party tonight,
We're breaking all the rules
But baby it all feels so right

You're breaking my heart tonight, 
Kissing me hard, seeing Valentino stars tonight,
I just wanna party tonight, 
We're breaking all the rules
But baby it all feels so right
