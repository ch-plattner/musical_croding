
Hold me in your arms,
Love me like your best friends did,
Promise I won't hurt you kid,
Hold me really tight until the stars look big,
Never let me go.

All the world is ours,
Like they say in Scarface kid,
You can push your drugs and I can make it big,
Sing at CBGB's have a real good gig,
Hey you never know.

Cause baby we were born to live fast and die young,
Born to be bad, have fun,
Honey, you and me can be one,
Just believe, come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

We gonna go far,
I can already taste it kid,
LA's gonna look real good,
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big,
Never let me go.

Send me to the stars,
Tell me when I get there kid,
I can be your Nancy,
You can be my Sid,
Get into some trouble like our parents did,
Hey, they'll never know,

Cause baby we were born to be bad,
Move on,
Built to go fast,
and stay strong,
Honey, you and me and no one,
Just believe,
Come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

I remember when I saw you for the first time,
You were laughing,
Sparking like a new dime,
I came over,
"Hello, can you be mine?"
Can you be mine,
Can you be mine?

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Baby it's a sweet life,
Sing it like a song,
It's a short trip,
Only getting one who can count on me and my love more than anyone,
Never let me go.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.
