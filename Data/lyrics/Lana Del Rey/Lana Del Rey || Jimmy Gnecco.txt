I like the way your name echo
You are so fine
I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go of my mind

If you want it its yours
Its free, but of course
Your my sunshine
I said Jay, your the boss
Without you I'm lost
Your my sunshine

I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine
I said Hey, Jimmy, lets go
Ive been in love since I met you, you are all mine

If you want it its yours
Its free, but of course
Pick a highlight
I said Jay, your the boss
Without you I'm lost
Your my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog
Kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark

I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey I like your heavy metal
Do you like mine?
I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco 
You were smashin' from the ghecko
This is your time

If you want it its yours
Its free, but of course
Pick a highlight
I said Jay, your the boss
Without you I'm lost
Your my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me something pretty
Kiss me in the dark
