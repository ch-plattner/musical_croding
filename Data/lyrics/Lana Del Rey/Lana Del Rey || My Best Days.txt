
Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I find somebody like you
Like you
Like you
