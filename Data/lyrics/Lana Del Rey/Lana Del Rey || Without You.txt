
Everything I want I have:
Money, notoriety and rivieras.
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of the pretty cameras,
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras.
Am I glamorous? Tell me am I glamorous?

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you want to see me fall.
Boy, you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They all think I have it all.
I've nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.

Summertime is nice and hot,
And my life is sweet like vanilla is.
Gold and silver line my heart
But burned into my brain are these stolen images,
Stolen images, baby, stolen images.
Can you picture it,
Babe, the life we could've lived?

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll
If you like to see me fall.
Boy, you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They all think I have it all.
I've nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.

We were two kids, just tryin' to get out,
Lived on the dark side of the American dream.
We would dance all night, play our music loud,
When we grew up, nothing was what it seemed.

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll

Boy, you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They think that I have it all.
I've nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.

All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you.
