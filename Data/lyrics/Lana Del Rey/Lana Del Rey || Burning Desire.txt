Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair, I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I been?
I've been everywhere
I don't wanna be no where but here
(Come on, tell me boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair, I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire

Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares, have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name is on my lips
Over over again, like my only prayer
(Come on, tell me boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair, I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire

I'm driving fast, flash, everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I'm driving fast, flash, everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I'm driving fast, flash, everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I'm driving fast, flash, everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
(Come on, tell me boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair, I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desire
