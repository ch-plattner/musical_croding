
Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember New Year's that year everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove for the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end
You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm you're one if you want me to be

Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah yeah

Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people they are not strangers
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight
