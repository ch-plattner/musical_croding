Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavily, betterly, on the grind
Cause to sing this nice, is the beat of crime
I've been murdering, I'm murdering 'em
Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard, to stay far, far away from me
Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
Boys stay away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the far east side
Baby I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in ch-ch-cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'm a dangerous girl,
You should stay away from me
I've been murdering, I'm murdering em
I be murdering, I'm murdering em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I've been tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
Cause I'm hot like that when I walk to die
I be murdering, I'm murdering em um
Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Bye, bye
Please excuse my mo-vivacity, capacity for head games
Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me,
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy step away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in ch-ch-cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'm a dangerous girl,
Baby should stay away from me
I've been murdering, I'm murdering em happily
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em

Indicitble, predictable
Now everyone knows I'm a good girl
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight
I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, you liking what you see?
Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-est side
Baby I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' in touch your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey I'm a dangerous girl,
You should stay away from me
