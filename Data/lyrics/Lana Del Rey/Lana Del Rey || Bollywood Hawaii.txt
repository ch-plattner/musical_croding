Everytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd bothe be dead if you found out

Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl

loha loha mahi kati ane wah loha loha mahakana mani waah[?]
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for

So if you begin
to think that my light might be supernatural
and everythings alright
alright [?]

I came from a place
that your mind can not even imagine

we say whoa
whoa -oh
oh oh
whoa -oh

and we sing
loha loha mahi kati ane wah loha loha mahakana mani waah[?]
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for

I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving
