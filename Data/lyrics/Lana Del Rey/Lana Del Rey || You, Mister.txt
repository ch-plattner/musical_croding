
I'm doin' alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doin' real well
And I, think that I might claim you as mine
So that my half can rest and everybody can tell
And I, had a strange dream
And I, called you at night
And I, had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you, on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away
And I, think of you here
And I, close my eyes tight
So now the vision of you near makes me feel alright
And I, had a strange dream
And I, called you at night
And I, had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind

Had you, on my mind
Had you, on my mind

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm hmm mmm
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
mmm hmm mmm mmmmmm

Had you, on my mind
Had you, on my mind
