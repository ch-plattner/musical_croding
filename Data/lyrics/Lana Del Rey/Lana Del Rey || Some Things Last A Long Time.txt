
Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

Red is strong, but blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
I think about you often, often

I can’t forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

It’s funny, but it’s true
And it’s true, but it’s not funny

Time comes and goes
All the while I still think about you
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

Things that we did are we forget
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time
