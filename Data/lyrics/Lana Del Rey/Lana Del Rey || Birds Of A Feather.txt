
Met you in front of the diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
