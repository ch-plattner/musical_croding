Move down & up slow n' prostitute stare
I do what I like I just don't care

I am my only god I am my only god
I am my only god 
now

Black eyes short dress lets break it down
You shoot and I pose polaroid frown
I'll do what you like I wont make a sound

I am my only god I am my only god
I am my only god
now

Icon young star heroin fiend 
Just sit n' I'll sing I'll be yr queen
You know how I like that celebrity type
poor me 

I am my only god I am my only god
I am my only god
now
