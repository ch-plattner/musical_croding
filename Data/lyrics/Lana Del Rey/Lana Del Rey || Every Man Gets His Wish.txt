
You can whistle first

Baby you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While your  t-t-t-t-touching me 
We're forever young in paradise
As long as we got Chevrolet-ah, we'll ride

We're gonna party like its 1949
riding that Chevrolet from July till July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sun rise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

You said I'd never make out outta here alive
With the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like were running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesdays
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milk shake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
(Special side of heartbreak)
I was working down at the corner cafe
You drove my in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey how you get that way?
(How you get that way?)
I said
He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Crystal crystal champagne glasses

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied
