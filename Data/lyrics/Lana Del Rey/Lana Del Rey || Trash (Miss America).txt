Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really loved nobody, but you?

I'll do my hair up all high and wide, wild flowers tied
Green swimming pool pink flamingos, high christmas lights
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel, my hearts delight

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you? 

Do you like my fake nails daddy?
Black palmtree pink tiger-stripes
Used to go to the kamfreena
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie?
We didn't know much, just worked at night 
Sweet trailer light

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Never loved nobody, but you 

He said: Lana-Ray, will you serve me lemonade?
And I said: yes Bill I will, its the day of the parade
and you look even more handsome than you did 
the day that I left you
And I said: how do you spend your nights, honey?
Still watchin' TV? I long to be in your arms, sugar,
Come back to me
Please

All I want is to feel good 
All I want is to feel good 
All I want is to feel good you know?

Come on now if you want to 
If you want to if you want to
Its been a long time

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Never loved nobody, but you
