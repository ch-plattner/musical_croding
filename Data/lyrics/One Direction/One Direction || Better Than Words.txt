[Harry:]
Better than words
But more than a feeling (ow)
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

[Liam:]
Every time we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna...
How deep is your love?
God only knows, baby

[Chorus:]
Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ah, woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

It's better than words

[Niall:]
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!

[Zayn:]
Better than words

[Louis:]
Better than words
You drive me crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

[Niall:]
Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna sss
One more night
Irreplaceable (yeah), crazy, we're crazy

[Chorus:]
Ah, woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love (there's no way I can explain your love), no
Ah, woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

[Louis:]
Everyone tries (they try)
To see what it feels like (feels like)
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better, it's better, it's better

Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!
One more time
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!
Better than words

Yeah

[Chorus:]
Ah, woo
I don't know how else to sum it up (I don't know)
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ah, woo
I don't know how else to sum it up (sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow (the words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no

It's better than words

Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!
It's better than words
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!
It's better than words
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh ooh oh!
