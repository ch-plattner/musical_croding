[Liam:]
It feels like we've been livin' in fast forward
Another moment passing by
(Up up up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight
(Up up up all night)

[Harry:]
Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

[All:]
I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you

Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night

[Zayn:]
Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
(Up up up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back
(Up up up all night)

[Harry:]
Katy Perry's on replay

And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you

Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night

(We're gonna wanna stay up all night)
Up all night, up all night
(We're gonna wanna stay up all night)

[All:]
I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one (she's the one)
