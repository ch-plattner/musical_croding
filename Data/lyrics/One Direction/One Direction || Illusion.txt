[All:]
Tell me you believe in love
It's not an illusion

[Liam:]
I been thinking about the nights
And the dangerous tricks
People play on the eyes of the innocent
I could turn a lot of hearts
Into breaks with smoke and
Mirrors disappearing
Right in front of them

[Harry:]
But believe me
I'm not trying to deceive you
I promise falling for me
Won't be a mistake

[Zayn:]
No baby this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

[Liam:]
You don't ever have to worry about me
About how the cards fall
I'm all that you need tonight
I would never turn your heart into
Broken parts
You don't have to think twice
Looking in my eyes

[Louis:]
Can't you see it?
I'm not trying to mislead you
I promise falling for me
Won't be a mistake

[Zayn:]
No baby this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

[Niall:]
You can tie me up in chains
You can throw away the key
But there's no trapped doors
I'm not gonna leave
You're the truth I can't explain
You're the only one I see
It's not an illusion to me

[All:]
No baby this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion
