[Harry:]
Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it

[Zayn:]
I said, "can you give it back to me"
She said, "never in your wildest dreams"

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Liam:]
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist

[Harry:]
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Niall:]
I said, "can I take you home with me"
She said."never in your wildest dreams"

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Louis:]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

(Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Zayn:]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced
How we danced
1, 2, 1, 2, 3

[All:]
How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(We danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)
Danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Zayn:]
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
