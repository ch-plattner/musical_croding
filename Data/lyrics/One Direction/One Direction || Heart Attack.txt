I don't know what I did,
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah,
Got your voice in my head,
Sayin' "Let's just be friends,"
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna be okay,
I'm tryna be alright,
But seein' you with him,
Just don't feel right.

And I'm like (ow!) never thought it'd hurt so bad
Gettin' over you-ooh,
And (ow!) you're givin' me a heart attack
Lookin' like you do-ooh,
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one
It's (ow!) givin' me a heart attack,
Gettin' over you-ooh-ooh-ooh,

Yeah,
Baby now that you're gone,
I can't stand dumb love songs,
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah
Everyone's tellin' me,
I'm just too blind to see,
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah

I'm tryna be okay,
I'm tryna be alright,
But seein' you with him,
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (ow!) never thought it'd hurt so bad
Gettin' over you-ooh,
And (ow!) you're givin' me a heart attack
Lookin' like you do-ooh,
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one
