The light shines,
It's getting hot on my shoulders.
I don't mind,
This time it doesn't matter
Cause your friends,
They look good, but you look better

Don't you know all night I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round?

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh eh eh eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you

I'm weaker
My words fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head, don't you fail me now?
I start to say,
"I think I love you," but I make no sound

You know 'cause all my life, I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh eh eh eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Cause there's so much that I wanna say, I wanna say

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart

Under the lights tonight (eh eh eh eh)
You turned around, and you stole my heart (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, when I saw your face (eh eh eh eh)
I fell in love
It took a minute girl (eh eh eh eh) to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)

With just one look, yeah (eh eh eh eh)
Been waitin' for a girl like you
Been waitin' for a girl like you
