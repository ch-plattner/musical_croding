Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place

We keep taking turns
Oho-oho-oh
Will we ever learn

Ooh spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye

Who's gonna be the first one to compromise
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away
Forgetting every single promise we ever made

Ooh spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye

We keep taking turns
Will we ever learn
When will we learn

Ooh spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye

(The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us)
