Down
Ever since you came around
Everybody wanna drag us down
Is it cause we look too happy?
I'll never forget when you looked at me
And told me it was all mine
I remember that, like yesterday
It was a summer night on the west side
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah
We crossed paths like an intersection
Now we both headed in one direction

All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down

I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason

If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

[LunchMoney Lewis:]
She a work of art like Van Gogh
I'm underground like Camp Lo
Yeah I'm top of them pop charts
But I'm still saggin' my pants low
I don't do meetings, I cancel
One D let me get some of them fans though
Just a young nigga from Dade County
Where they move chickens like Nando
When I touch down in London town
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down
