[Liam:]
Once in a lifetime
It's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even a landslide
or riptide
could take it all away

[Harry:]
Somehow
it feels like nothing has changed
Right now
my heart is beating the same
out loud
someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

[Chorus:]
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

[Louis:]
Once in a lifetime
It's just right
We are always safe

[Niall:]
Not even the bad guys
in the dark night
Could take it all away

[Louis:]
Somehow
feels like nothing has changed
right now my heart is beating the same

[Niall:]
Out loud
someone's calling my name
And it sounds like you

[Chorus:]
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side [3x]

[Liam:]
Once in a lifetime
you were mine
