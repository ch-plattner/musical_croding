Diana
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Liam:]
The front pages are your pictures,
They make you look so small,
How could someone not miss you at all?

(Oh-ah-oh)

[Harry:]
I never would mistreat ya,
Oh I'm not a criminal,
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.

[All:]
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely,
You don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

(Oh-oh)

[Zayn:]
Diana

[Niall:]
It's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far.
How could someone mislead you at all?

(Oh-ah-oh)

[Louis:]
I wanna reach out for you,
I wanna break these walls,
I speak a different language but I still hear you call.

[All:]
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely,
You don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

[Harry:]
We all need something,
This can't be over now,
If I could hold you,
Swear I'd never put you down.

[All:]
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely,
You don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

(Oh-ah-oh)
Diana,
(Oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Diana,
Baby, you'd be saving mine,
(Oh-ah-oh)
Diana,
(Oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Diana,
Baby, you'd be saving mine.
