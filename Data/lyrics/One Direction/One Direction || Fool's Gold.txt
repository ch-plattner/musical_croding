
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly, oh
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time

But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

And, yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see
Two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

And, yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

And, yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold
