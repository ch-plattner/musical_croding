
B-b-b-baby c'mon over
I don't care if people find out (dada - dadada - da - da - da - da)
They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out (dada - dadada - da - da - da - da)

[Liam:]
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're lookin' like that (dada - dadada)
I can't hold back.

[Chorus:]
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic.

[Zayn:]
So l-l-let them take the pictures
Spread it all around the world now (dada - dadada - da - da - da - da)
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now (dada - dadada - da - da - da - da)

[Liam:]
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're lookin' like that (dada - dadada)
I can't hold back.

[Chorus:]
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic.

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Everything you do is magic.

They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now.

[Louis:]
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic.

[Chorus:]
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic.

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
C'mon
Kiss you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic.
