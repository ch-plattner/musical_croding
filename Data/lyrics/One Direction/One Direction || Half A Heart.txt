So your friends been telling me
You been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
Cause I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you
Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky)
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best (Half a man at best)
With half an arrow in my chest
Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Without you [x2]
Half a heart without you
Without you [x2]
Half a heart without you
