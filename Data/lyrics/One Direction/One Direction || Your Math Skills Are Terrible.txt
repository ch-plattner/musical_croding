[Liam]
You're insecure.
So half of four.
Your old brains are not what they were before.

[Zayn]
Add two threes. It's fun for us.
Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff.

[Harry]
Everyone else can multiply by sixty.
Everyone else can add two.

[All]
Now take off one hundred, and add on 24.
Then divide by two and add on seven more.
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible

If only you had a mind like me
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three
And then just add on the age of this OAP
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible, oh, oh

It's really kinda pitiful
