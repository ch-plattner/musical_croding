[Harry:]
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Liam & Louis:]
I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
Your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

[Niall:]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
You've got the whole shaking

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I gotta take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Liam, Niall & Louis:]
I keep on holding tight now
Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We are gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
It's bringing my demons out
More than ever down
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

[Liam:]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
We got the whole shaking

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I gotta take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Niall & Liam:]
I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
