You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away

[Niall:]
Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

[Zayn:]
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

(1, 2, 3)

[All:]
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I want to be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on baby be with me so happily

[Liam:]
It's 4am and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I've touched your skin

[Louis:]
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry lord but I don't really care

[Niall:]
Cause we're on fire, we're all on fire
We're on fire now

[Zayn:]
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

So come on baby be with me so happily
So happily
