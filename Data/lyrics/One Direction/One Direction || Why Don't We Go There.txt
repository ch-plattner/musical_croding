I know you want, know you wanna take it slow
But think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight
Just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side,
Just give me the key

'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way.
Why don't you go there with me?

Say the word, say the word but don't say "No"
Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes
The secret's safe with me
There's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see
We'll do it anyway

'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way.
Why don't you go there with me?

Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind,
I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say "No"
Just let go

'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride (let's take a ride)
Out in the cold air
I know the way (I know the way).
Why don't you go there with me?

With me, with me
Why don't you go there with me?
