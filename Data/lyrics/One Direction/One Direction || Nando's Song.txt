
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home
All of my change I spent on Lou
Where have his socks gone?
Niall it's all wrong
You ate the food we made for two
Yeah, I,

I know it's hard to remember that they tried out separately
It's even harder to picture, they placed at number three
Harry loves to get naked, but the boys never mind
As soon as they got famous, all of the fan girls broke down

Twitcams make me smile
Someone should tell Niall
To hide his profile
I'd let Larry Stylinson prank call my friends
Six R's in Terrance
Zayn's no pedophile

Now I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home
All of my change I spent on Lou
Where have his socks gone?
Niall it's all wrong
Where you ate the food we made for two.

Every time I read a new fanfic
Louis' munching on some carrot sticks
Why is Harry's hair always perfect?
Liam's only got one kidney left, yeah,

We better thank Simon Cowell for making the boys stay
Louis drove the van so slow
They got stopped twice that day
Zayn has such beautiful eyes
And perfectly quiffed hair
There are women in Sweden
Who wouldn't put their shirts down

Video diaries
Superman Louis
Liam loves Danielle Pea-zer and
Zayn loves Perrie
Niall and his guitar
Louis and Eleanor
The kazoo and Harry

I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home
All of my change I spent on Lou
Where have his socks gone?
Niall it's all wrong
You ate the food we made for two

Zayn should probably work on his dance moves
Niall is a big fan of the zoo
Harry used to share a flat with Lou
Liam won't go near another spoon
Now I'm at a Nando's
