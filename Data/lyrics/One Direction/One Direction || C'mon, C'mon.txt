[Zayn:]
The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone

So come on, come on

[Louis:]
Move a little closer now

[Liam:]
Come on, come on

[Louis:]
Ain't no way you're walkin' out

[Liam:]
Come on, come on

[Harry:]
Show me what you're all about

[All:]
Yeah
I been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

[Niall:]
The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do

So come on, come on

[Louis:]
Move a little closer now

[Liam:]
Come on, come on

[Louis:]
Ain't no way you're walking out

[Liam:]

[Harry:]
Show me what you're all about

[All:]
Yeah
I been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

Every step I take
I feel it more and more
She's calling out
She's looking good
My heart is racing
She's turning around
I reach for her hand and I say

[Zayn:]
Hey
I been watching you all night

[All:]
There's something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

Oooh,
Come on, come on
Oooh,
Come on, come on
Oooh,
Come on, come on
And dance with me baby
