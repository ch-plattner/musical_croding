[Liam:]
I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see,
I'm dancin' alone, I'm praying,
That your heart will just turn around,

And as I walk up to your door,
My head turns to face the floor,
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say,

[Harry:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this

[Niall:]
If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same
You save me,
When you leave it's gone again,

[Louis:]
And then I see you on the street,
In his arms, I get weak,
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Prayin',

[All:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn:]
Yeah, I've never had the words to say,
But now I'm askin' you to stay
For a little while inside my arms,
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
That's shining from the stars above,

(And I say)

[Liam:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn]
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

[All]
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down,
I might just die inside (oh, yeah),
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this
