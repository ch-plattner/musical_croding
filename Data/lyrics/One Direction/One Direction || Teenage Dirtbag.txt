[Harry:]
Her name is Noel
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

[All:]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

[Niall:]
Her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And drives an Iroc
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

[All:]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

[Zayn:]
Oh, yeah, dirtbag,
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag,
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

[Louis:]
Man, I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Low and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?

[Liam:]
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say, "Maybe."
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you

[All:]
Oh, yeah dirtbag,
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah dirtbag,
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
