
From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine (take you and make you mine)

I would walk through the desert
I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine (whatever it takes is fine)

Oh oh ohh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh
'Cause it’s a stand up
I won’t be leaving
‘Til I finish stealing
Every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

I know your heart's been broken but don’t you give up
I’ll be there, yeah I know it to fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you’ve ever cried (you’ve ever cried)

Oh oh ohh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh
'Cause it’s a stand up
I won’t be leaving
‘Til I finish stealing
Every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

Oh oh ohh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh
'Cause it’s a stand up
I won’t be leaving
‘Til I finish stealing
Every piece of your heart

And I will steal us a car
And we will drive to the stars.
I will give you the moon.
It’s the least I can do
If you give me the chance.

Oh oh ohh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh
'Cause it’s a stand up

(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
You can call me a thief
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
But you should know your part

(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
I’m only here
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
Because you stole my heart

Oh oh ohh oh (I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh (I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
'Cause it’s a stand up
I won’t be leaving
'Til I finish stealing
Every piece of your heart

'Cause you stole my heart
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
Call me a thief
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
But you should know your part
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
I’m only here
(I’m a thief, I’m a thief)
Because you stole my heart
