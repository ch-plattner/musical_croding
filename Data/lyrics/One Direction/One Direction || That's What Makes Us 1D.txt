[Liam:]
Harry does fall a lot on stage
And he likes women of a certain a-a-age (OP's)

[Louis:]
We were once five
And now we're four

[Niall:]
I fell over playing golf
And it was sore-or-or (oh no Niall)

[Harry:]
Everyone in the world has seen us
But now we're taking a break

[All:]
Louis forgets all his words when we're singing
When Liam's phone bleeps it's Simon ringing
Everyone has a 1D doll
Now you know
Now you know
That's what makes us 1D!
