If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say it's getting late
It's getting late
And you don't know if you can stay
If you can stay.

But you, you don't tell the truth
No you, you like playing games

Your hands touching me, they're touching me.
And your eyes keep saying things.
They say of what we do
When it's only me and you.
I can't concentrate.

That's all I'm thinking about.
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

Back seat of the cab,
We're in the cab.
My lips getting so attached,
They're so attached.

Now you wanna make some rules
Now coolâ€”then we'll watch them break tonight.

I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

I know you want it
I know you feel it too.
Let's stop pretending.
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
