[Harry:]
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat running out of time
Without you I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright

[Liam:]
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know, that I'll be fine

[Chorus:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

[Niall:]
There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me

[Louis:]
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright

[Chorus:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run

[Zayn:]
This time I'm ready to run (ready to run)
I'd give everything that I got for your love

[Harry:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun

[All:]
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (this time I'm ready to run)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run
