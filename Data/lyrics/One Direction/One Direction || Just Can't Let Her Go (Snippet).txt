She's so mean, but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean, but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go

La la la, la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go

Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind, yeah, oh oh oh oh

I want her, everybody wants her
She knows it, hey hey hey.
I want her, but I better run away

Oh oh oh oh

She's so mean, but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean, but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go

La la la, la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
