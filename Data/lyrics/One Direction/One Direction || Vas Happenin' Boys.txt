There once was a group with Liam and Niall
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?

Did you know Harry's such a slob?
He needs to win X Factor 'cause he can't get a job

And, oh, Louis needs a boat
He dresses like he owns one
'Cause he's got no other clothes
They really need your vote

Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
(Vas Happenin' boys?)

Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad
Vas Happenin' mum? Vas Happenin' Mick?
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad
Vas Happenin' song? Vas Happenin' sad?

And Zayn's the master of echoes (echo, echo, echo)
And Niall was raised by leprechauns so he won't ever grow

And, oh, Louis needs that boat
He dresses like he owns one
And it's becoming a joke
They really need your vote

Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
(Billy bob bob billy)
