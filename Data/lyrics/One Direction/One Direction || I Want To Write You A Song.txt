[Harry:]
I want to write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I want to write you a song

[Liam:]
I want to lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I want to lend you my coat

[Louis:]
Oooh, everything I need I get from you
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Liam:]
I want to build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I want to build you a boat

[Louis:]
Oooh, everything I need I get from you
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Harry:]
Oooh, everything I need I get from you
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Niall:]
I want to write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I want to write you a song
I want to write you a song
