[Harry:]
I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

[Niall:]
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Liam:]
Said the night was over, I said it's forever
20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But girl it's only you

[Louis:]
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Louis:]
When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

[Harry & All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
