
You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hiding
And I just wanna see ya

You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart,
I'd be there to hold ya

You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you were laughing
So let's just laugh again

But don't burn out even
If you scream and shout
It'll come back to you,
Back to you

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

And you don't need, you don't need to run
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved

Oh, I will carry you over fire and water for your love...

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way through the dark
