[Verse 1]
[Liam]
We've got a bit of love/hate
You take me to the edge then you hit the brakes
I say it's over one day,
But then I'm crawling back begging you to stay
We make up and we break up all the time

I'll say that I hate a song,
Then you'll go request it the whole night long
Some people say it's so wrong but even when we fight,
Girl, you turn me on
We make up and we break up all the time

[Chorus]
We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

[Zayn]
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
[Liam]
You wanna party too late
But when I do the same all you do is complain.
You know that it drives me insane
When I get with you girl you make it okay.
We make up and we break up all the time.

[Chorus]
We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

[Zayn]
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah [2x]

[Zayn]
Oh oh oh... It drives me mad, oh

Na [20x]

[Chorus]
We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

[Zayn]
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right

We go na, na, na, na
