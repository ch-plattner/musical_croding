He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

(Na na na na na)

When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

(Na na na na na) [2x]

He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things,
I know, that I could
If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that youâ€™ll call later on
'Cause you wanna say good night

'Cause I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish that was me

Oh how I wish that was me
