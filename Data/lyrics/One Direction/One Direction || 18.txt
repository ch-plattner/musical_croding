[Harry:]
I got a heart
And I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Zayn:]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Harry:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]
We took a chonce [An alternative for the word 'chance'. Commonly used by One Direction's Niall Horan]
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

[Liam:]
So pour me a drink, oh, love,
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can livin' love in slow motion, motion, motion

[Zayn:]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[All:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]
When we were 18
Oh, Lord, when we were 18

[Zayn:]
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Louis:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing

[Harry:]
To be loved and to be in love

[All:]
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
