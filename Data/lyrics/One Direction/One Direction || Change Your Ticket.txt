[Harry:]
Watching you get dressed
Messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come get back in bed
We still got time left
This don't have to be over

[Niall:]
And you say
It's hard to keep a secret
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
one weekend
I promise that I'll never tell

[Chorus:]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home,
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home,
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone,
So, you should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home

[Zayn:]
Don't play innocent
I know what you meant
When you said you'd come over

[Niall:]
Aren't we way past that?
Playin' hard to get
We did that when we were younger

[Louis:]
And you say,
It's hard to keep a secret
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
one weekend,
I promise that I'll never tell

[Chorus:]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home, oh
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
Come on let me change your ticket home, oh

[Zayn:]
Why don't we take some time
Why don't we take just a little more time
Why don't we make it right
Girl, I don't wanna say goodbye

[Chorus:]
You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home, oh
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone,
Come on let me change your ticket home
