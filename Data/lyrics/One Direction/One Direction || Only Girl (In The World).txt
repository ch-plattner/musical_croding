I want you to love me,
Like I'm a hot guy
Keep thinkin' of me yeaah,
Doin' what you like

[Zayn]
So girl forget about the world 
Cuz it's gon' be me and you tonight
I'm gonna make your bed for ya, 
And then I'm gonna swallow my pride

[All]
I'm gonna make you feel, like you're the only girl in the world
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cause your the only one who understands
How to make me feel like a man
Only girl...

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby take me high, high
Let me make you first, first
Make it last all night, night

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby take me high, high
Let me make you first, first
Make it last all night...

I'm gonna make you feel like you're the only girl in the world
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command

Cause you're the only one who understands
How to make me feel like a man
Only girl...
