[Niall:]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

[Liam:]
I know how it goes
I know how it goes for wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other
Tight like us
Did they ever fight like us

[Harry:]
You & I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between
You & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No nothing can come between
You & I
Oohh You & I

[Zayn:]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

[Louis:]
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
Cause they see things in a different light
Like us
They never tried like us

[Harry:]
You & I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between
You & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us

[Zayn:]
'Cause You & I
[All:]
We don't want to be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between You & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No nothing can come between
You & I

[Zayn:]
You & I

[Harry:]
Oohh You & I [x2]

[Zayn:]
We can make it if we try
You & I

[Harry:]
Oohh you & I
You & I
