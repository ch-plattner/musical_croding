[Niall:]
You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

[Zayn:]
You're so London your own style, your own style
And together we're so good, so girl why are you
Tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

[Harry:]
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

[All:]
Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

[Louis:]
Was so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart

[Harry:]
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

[All:]
Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh.
[Harry:] Nobody compares to you
[All:] Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh.

[Niall:]
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

[All:]
Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
