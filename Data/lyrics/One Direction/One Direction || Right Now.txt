
Lights go down, and the night is calling to me, yeah.
I hear voices singing songs in the street

And I know that we won't be going home for so long, for so long.
But I know that I won't be on my own, yeah.

I love this feeling that right now
I wish you were here with me
Cause right now
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.

Late night spaces with all our friends, you and me, yeah.
Love these faces just like how it used to be.

And we won't be going home for so long, for so long.
But I know, I won't be on my own, on my own.

I'm feeling like right now
I wish you were here with me
Cause right now
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.

And I could do this forever.
Whoa, whoa.
And let's go crazy together.
Whoa, whoa.

Lights go down and I hear you calling to me, yeah.

Right now
I wish you were here with me
Cause right now
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.
