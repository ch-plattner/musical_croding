Yeah (aha), one, two, three, four!

[Harry:]
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go
Let it go
[Louis:]
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Take her home

[Liam:]
But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

[Niall:]
Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth
What you're worth
[Louis:]
Or maybe all her friends have told her don't get closer
He'll just break your heart
[Niall:]
But either way she's teasing me and it's just so hard

[Liam:]
Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

(One, two, three, four)

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

[Harry:]
What about all the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me
Oooh

[Zayn:]
But when I say that I can't do it no more
She's back at my door

[Laugh]

She's not
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

She's not afraid
She's not afraid

[All:]
Ohhhhh
