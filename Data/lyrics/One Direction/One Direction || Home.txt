[Liam:]
Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive

[Niall:]
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

[Harry:]
I was stumbling, looking in the dark (ohho)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?
Baby we could be enough

[All:]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find the way
I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone

[Louis:]
I'll make this feel like home

[Niall:]
So hot that I couldn't take it
Want to wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night

[Louis:]
Still high with a little feeling
I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes

[Harry:]
I was stumbling, looking in the dark (ohho)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?
Baby we could be enough

[All:]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find the way
I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone

[Louis:]
I'll make this feel like home
I'll make this feel like home

[Harry:]
Baby we could be enough

[All:]
It's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find the way
I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone

[Louis:]
I'll make this feel like home
