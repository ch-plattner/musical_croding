Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M (yeah yeah)

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 goin' on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learned, how
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

You know I'm always coming back to this place
You know
And I'll say
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
You know

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always coming back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
