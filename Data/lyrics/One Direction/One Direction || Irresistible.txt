[Harry:]
Don't try to make me stay
Or ask if I'm okay
I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night
Or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer.

[Liam:]
Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye.

[Chorus:]
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes irresistible.

[Niall:]
I've tried to ask myself
Should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer.

[Harry:]
But I know, if I go now, if I leave
Then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer.

[Liam:]
Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down, down, down,
That's why.

[Chorus:]
I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes irresistible
(Irresistible)
Irresistible
(Irresistible)
Irresistible
(Irresistible)
Irresistible
(Irresistible).

It's in your lips and in your kiss
It's in your touch and your fingertips
And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible.

[Chorus:]
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Irresistible.
