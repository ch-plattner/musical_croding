Just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn
Can't stop looking at you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know

Little black dress
Did you come here alone?
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to go home

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright you know

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Whoa

Little black dress
Who you doin' it for?
Little black dress
I can't take anymore
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right, you know

Little black dress
What's your favourite song?
Little black dress
I won't do you no harm

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know
It's alright
It's alright
'Cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Whoa oh

[Guitar Break]

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Ooh
