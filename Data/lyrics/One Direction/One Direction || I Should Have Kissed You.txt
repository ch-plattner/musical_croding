[Liam]
I keep playing it inside my head
All that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself
This wasn't just a dream

[Liam]
'Cause you were right here
[Harry]
And I should've taken the chance
[Liam]
But I got so scared
[Harry]
And I lost the moment again

[Harry]
It's all that I can think about, oh
You're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you

Every morning when I leave my house
I always look for you, yeah.
I see you everytime I close my eyes
What am I gonna do?

[Liam]
And all my friends say
[Zayn]
That I'm punching over my weight
[Liam]
But in your eyes I
[Zayn]
Saw how you were looking at me

It's all that I can think about, oh
You're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you

[Zayn]
When you stood there
Just a heartbeat away
When we were dancing,
And you looked up at me
If I had known then
That I'd be feeling this way
If I could replay
I would have never let you go
[Liam]
No, oh
Never have let you go
Am I out of time?

Is your heart taken?
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you

I should have kissed you
