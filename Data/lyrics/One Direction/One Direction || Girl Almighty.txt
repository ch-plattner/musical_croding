[LIAM:]
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior, oh (whoa whoa whoa)

[HARRY:]
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake,"
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no

[NIALL:]
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

[ZAYN:]
Am I the only, only believer?

There's something happening here [2x]

The only, only believer

(There's something happening here,
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)

[LIAM:]
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees for you
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you

[LOUIS:]

No, no, no, no
