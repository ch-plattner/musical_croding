
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doin'?
And in my head I paint a picture!

Well since you've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess.
I miss your ginger hair,
And the way you like to dress.

Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me!
So why don't you come on over, Valerie!

Valerie! [x3]

Why don't you come on over, Valerie
