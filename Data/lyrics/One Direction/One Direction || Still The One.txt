[Liam:]
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while
But, baby, I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know, oh, oh, oh

[Louis:]
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

[All:]
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one

[Niall:]
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl, just tell me what I wanna hear

[Harry:]
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said, yeah
I can't get it out of my head, yeah

Now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

[All:]
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one

Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you-

[Harry:]
You're still the one

[All:]
I know it's saying too much (Yeah)
But I will never give up (C'mon)
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one
