
Yeah... ohh...
Can't believe you're, packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

Cause you were mine, for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

Wish that we could be alone now
We could find some place to hide
Make the last time, just like the first time
Push a button and rewind
Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

Cause you were mine, for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my, summer love
You always will be my, summer love

So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I want to change, to change

Cause you were mine, for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love (summer love)
You always will be, my summer love (summer love)
You always will be, my summer love (yeah)
You always will be, my summer love
