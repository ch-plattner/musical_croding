[Harry]
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

[Harry]
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Liam]
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Louis]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Zayn]
Be loved by you
I wanna, I’ll stay true
I wonder if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

[Liam]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

[Zayn]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Harry]
And all the girls say
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Zayn]
And that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
To be loved by you
