Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Harry:]
I've been roaming around,
I was looking down in all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Louis:]
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the streets

You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah

Someone like you

[All:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Niall:]
Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape, the poet and the beat

Well I hope it's going to make you notice
Well I hope it's going to make you notice

[Zayn:]
Someone like me

[All:]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) someone like me (somebody)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Liam:]
I'm ready now, I'm ready now
I'm ready now
[All:]
I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
I'm ready now, I'm ready now

[Harry:]
One, two, three, four

[All:]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you
[Harry:]
Somebody
[All:]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you
[Harry:]
Somebody
[All:]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Harry:]
I've been roaming around, always looking down in all I see
