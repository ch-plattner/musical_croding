Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

[Harry]
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man.

[All]
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young.
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever,
Forever young?

[Niall]
Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are a melody and some are the beat,
But sooner or later they all will be gone,
Why don't they stay young?

[Harry]
It's hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever.

[All]
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young.
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young (forever).
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever
Or never?

[Liam]
So many adventures couldn't happen today,
So many songs we forgot to play,
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,
We let 'em come true.

[Harry]
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young.
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever
Or never?

[All]
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young.
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young (forever).
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),
Forever
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young (forever).
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),
Forever (forever),
Forever young...
