[Marcel:] Really nice to meet you guys. I'm a huge fan. Cute as a button, every single one of you! First scene, I'm talking MASSIVE dance number. I'm thinking a hundred dancers, fireworks, a lot! Dance is just so HOT right now!
[Harvey:] Hey, you know I used to be a dancer?
[Jonny:] Really? What kind?
[Harvey:] Eh... mainly tap.

[Marcel:] I want you to meet Leeroy, he's gonna be your choreographer... Leeroy, hmmm!
[Leeroy:] Hi boys, hi! Okay, so here's what I'm thinking... First open number is gonna be really big. Stay with me, 'cause I'm quite quick, and five six seven eight. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT and Niall for the shimmy, for the shimmy, for the shimmy, and Zayn pirouette, and
Louis do the splits, and Liam, you stay exactly where you are because you are PER-FECT.
[Louis:] We'd NEVER do that.
[Leeroy:] Oh!
[Marcel:] So that's something for us to work on. Thanks Leeroy! So let's take a look at some of the styling options for the film. Now, personally, I think this one is the one.
[Harry:] Absolutely not.
[Louis:] We'd NEVER wear that.
[Marcel:]... Right, how about... THIS one?
[Liam:] No.
[Marcel:] It tested really well!
[Zayn:] Never, in a million years.
[Marcel:] Ta da!

Maybe it's the way she walked (wow) straight into my heart and stole it.
Through the doors and past the guards (wow), just like she already owned it.

I said, "Can you give it back to me?" She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh

Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow), and her daddy was a dentist.
Said I had a dirty mouth (You got a dirty mouth) but she kissed me like she meant it.

I said, "Can I take you home with me?" She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,
[In background:]
(Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced how we danced

1, 2, 1, 2, 3

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.
(We danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)

We danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
