[Zayn:]
Girl, that should be me driving to your house,
Knocking on your door, kissing you on the mouth,

[Liam:]
Pulling on your hand, dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start.

[Harry:]
But now when I see you with him it tears my world apart.

[All:]
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse.
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first.

[Louis:]
Girl, that should be me calling on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go.

[Harry:]
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes.

[Liam:]
But now when I see you with him my whole world falls apart.
[All:]
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse.
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first.

[Zayn:]
First touch (first touch), first kiss (first kiss),
First girl who made me feel like this (like this)
Heartbreak (heartbreak), it's killing me (k-k-killin' me),
I loved you first â€’ why can't you see?

[Niall:]
I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken,
Nothing could be worse.

[Zayn:]
Baby, I loved you first.

[All:]
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first

[Zayn:]
Baby, I loved you first.
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah.

[Harry:]
Baby I loved you first.
