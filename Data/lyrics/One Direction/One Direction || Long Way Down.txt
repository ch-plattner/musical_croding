
We made a fire
Went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean
And drowned in a wave
Built a cathedral
But we never prayed
We had it all, yeah
And we walked away

Point of no return
And now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you,
But I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down
It's a long way down from here

We had a mountain
But took it for granted
We had a spaceship,
But we couldn't land it
We found an island,
But we got stranded
We had it all, yeah
Who could've planned it?

Point of no return
And now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you,
But I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
