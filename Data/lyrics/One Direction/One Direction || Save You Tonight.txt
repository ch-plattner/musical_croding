
I, I wanna save you
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh

[Liam]
It's a quarter to three can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

[Harry]
All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed

I, I wanna save you
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be super human

I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight

[Zayn]
Oh, now you're at home
And he don't call
Cause he don't adore you
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn you

[Harry]
What you want, what you need
Has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears

I, I wanna save you
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be super human
I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight

[Louis]
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me

I, I wanna save you
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be super human
I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
