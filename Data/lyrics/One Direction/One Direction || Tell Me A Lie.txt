[Liam]
Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried

[Zayn]
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired

As you break my heart again this time

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he’s what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and...

[Liam] tell me a lie

[Liam]
Well you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time.

[Harry]
And well there must've been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind

[Liam]
As you take what's left of you and I

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and...

Tell me a lie

(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie!

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess (mess)
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss (kiss)
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!
