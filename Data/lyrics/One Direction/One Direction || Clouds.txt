[Verse 1 - Harry:]
I know you said that you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple no

[Pre-chorus - Louis:]
Someday you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

[Chorus - Harry:]
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end

We're never coming back down
We're looking down on the clouds

[Verse 2 - Liam:]
I know you said that you don't like it complicated
But you were tired of all the changes
But love is always always changing woah

[Pre-chorus - Zayn:]
Someday you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you'd never left me

[Chorus - Harry:]
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end

We're never coming back down
We're looking down on the clouds

[Bridge - Niall:]
And we go and we go and we go and we don't stop

[Bridge - Harry:]
But we don't no we don't no we don't ever grow up

[Bridge - Niall:]
And we go and we go and we go and we don't stop

[Bridge - Harry:]
But we don't no we don't no we don't ever grow up

[Chorus - Harry:]
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end (Here we go again)

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends (Here we go again)
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again (Here we go again)
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end (Here we go again)
