When you appeared
I was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense
For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't know me
You don't know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

It's in your eyes
I can see that you're broken
I know you're lost because I am too
It's in your voice
I hear you choking
When did the illusion take the truth
I think you're in love
With the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby it's clear
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal
