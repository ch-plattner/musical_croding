
If I'm catching your eye
It was an accident
If I looked at you strange
Its not what I meant
I wanted to talk
You're occupied
I tried to explain but I'm tongue tied
I'll wait in the wings again
Until you find me out
What is the hold up

Ooo oo oo oo
I'm not following you
Ooo oo oo oo
Walking this way too
Ooo oo oo oo
I've had enough of dreaming
All my dreams are you

If I sat next to you
That wasn't my intent
And if my hand falls on yours
It was coincidence
I'll stay in the room until you're gone
I'll switch to the chair that you sat on
I'll sit there alone again
Until you find me out
What is the hold up

Ooo oo oo oo
I'm not following you
Ooo oo oo oo
Walking this way too
Ooo oo oo oo
See I've had enough of dreaming 
All my dreams are you

I wish you would notice me
If not now, eventually
Then I wouldn't have to follow you around
And hunt you down
H-h-hunt you down
Hunt you down

Promise we'll get along
If you talk to me
We'll tell eachother our stories imperfectly
Imperfectly

I wanted to talk
You're occupied
I tried to explain but I'm tongue tied
I'll wait in the wings again
Until you find me out
See what is the hold up

Ooo oo oo oo
I'm not following you
Ooo oo oo oo
Walking this way too
Ooo oo oo oo
I've had enough of dreaming
All my dreams are you
