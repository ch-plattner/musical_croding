
You wake up, I know it's time to go
With a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke
Chase the hands on my watch, and hold you close
This misery is weightless as a stone

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know that panic I know?
Would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?

I wish time was still,
We'd stay right here
With time to kill
In our hearts without chains

And if time was still
We'd have no fear,
Or scars to heal
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains

You left everything behind except yourself
But all I see is question marks and nothing else
You must have landed in New York by now
Please don't bring this love down

And have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know that panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever oh I know?

I wish time was still
We'd stay right here
With time to kill
In our hearts without chains

And if time was still
We'd have no fear,
Or scars to heal
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains

Don't bring this love down [4x]

I wish time was still
We'd stay right here
With time to kill
In our hearts without chains

And if time was still
We'd have no fear,
Or scars to heal
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
