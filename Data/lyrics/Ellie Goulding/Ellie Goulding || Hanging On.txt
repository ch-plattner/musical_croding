
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

I just can't keep hanging on, to you and me
I just don't know what is wrong, with you and me

Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain, nooo

I just can't keep hanging on, to you and me
I just don't know what is wrong

[Tinie Tempah]
Give me the respect, forgive me and forget
We've got to get a grip, living on the edge
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit
I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed, and I gave her everything she wanted
Miss something 'bout your cleavage
Now why can't put my fingers on it
You're taking me the deepest
I thought that she was coming for me
If all women are from venus, then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck, but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

I just can't keep hanging on to you and me, with you, with me
With you, with...
