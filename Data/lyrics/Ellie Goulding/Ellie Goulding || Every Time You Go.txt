
Every time you go
Every time you go.

It starts with a picture,
And it sits in your frame.
And we part with a letter,
And it ends in my name.

And it starts with forever,
And it ends with a touch.
And I know that you're clever,
And I don't ask for much.

Maybe we forgot all the things we are, we are together.

You said I'm arresting,
You said I had heat.
I really thought that we'd go further
The second time we meet.

Now I'm tired of trying to keep you.
All I want to do is sleep.
And perhaps, when I'm sleeping,
You'll get back on your feet.

Maybe we forgot all the things we are, we are together.

Wake me up,
Wake me up.
Stop my fall,
Every time you go.

Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently,
When I'm at my weakest.

It's not so hard
Every time you go.

I run a mount to meet you
When I knew a storm had come
I felt the rain on your face
And the damage you had done.

I know what you're thinking.
It will never be the end.
And when the storm is over,
You won't see me again.

Didn't know the price I paid for all the times I stayed
When we were together.

Wake me up,
Wake me up.
Stop my fall,
Every time you go.

Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently,
When I'm at my weakest.

It's not so hard

Maybe we forgot, are we awake or not?
Maybe we forgot, are we awake or not?
Maybe we forgot, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot.

Wake me up,
Wake me up.
Stop my fall,
Every time you go.

Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently,
When I'm at my weakest.

Wake me up,
Wake me up.
Stop my fall,
Every time you go.

Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently,
When I'm at my weakest.

It's not so hard
Every time you go.
