
I'll never forget that feeling
When I watched you disappear
When you made me stop believing
I could fight away the fear
Now the smoke has cleared
And the end is near
It was my illusion
Like a broken dream I was incomplete
But your love was never missing

I feel like I am breathing again
I feel like I am seeing again
I feel like I am breathing again
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh

All that's real is faded, like a car into the night
Like painkiller I take it
And I watch the world ignite

Now the smoke has cleared
And the end is near
It was my illusion
Like a broken dream I was incomplete
But your love was never missing

I feel like I am breathing again
I feel like I am seeing again
I feel like I am breathing again
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh

I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh

I got it under control oh oh

I got it under control oh oh

I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh

I feel like I am breathing again
I feel like I am seeing again
I feel like I am breathing again
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh

I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
I got it under control oh oh
