Enemy, used to be
Part of you, bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down, cold and hot
Swear to God, got to stop
Because I can't sleep at night

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better
Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive
You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Lost in you, lost in me
Afraid of love, in too deep
So we just run and hide
Lightning fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive
You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better
Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive
You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die
Say we'll never die
