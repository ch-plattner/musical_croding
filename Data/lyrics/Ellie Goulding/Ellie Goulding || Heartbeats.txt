
One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away

Both under influence
We had a divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands from above
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
Tonight to push and scream
And then relief

Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands from above
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

To call for hands from above
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolves teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands from above
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

To call for hands from above
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
for me, no
to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
