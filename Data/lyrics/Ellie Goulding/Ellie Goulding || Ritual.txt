
We run into a blazing fire
We hold our heads up high tonight
And we breathe the smoke, the fear real
We let our hearts subside tonight

But it marks my skin ‘cause I know I’ve sinned
And it plagues the air, on my house looming
There’s a sound out here in the darkest woods
And I know my fears are understood

It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
It’s a ritual, and I know you see it
It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

We move into the devil’s shoes
It’s far too late to be rescued
From highway seas and thunder skies
We see our fate, you hear our cries

They go, oh oh oh oh
And it won't stop here, echo in my ear
There's a raging fire, and it burns so near
But I'm ready now, but I’m ready now

It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
It’s a ritual, and I know you see it
It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
It’s a ritual, and I know you see it
It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all

Oh we lose it all
We lose it all

It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
It’s a ritual, and I know you see it
It’s a ritual, and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all

The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
The ritual, we lose it all
