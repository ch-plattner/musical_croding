Used to roll in perfect motion, easy
Lips like Tanqueray
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping
I don't know what changed
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night
You've been running from the dark
You can't look me in the eyes
Being called into the heat
Even if it's burning me
I just need to dance without you

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Through the streets and all the places I've been
I can see we never had harmony
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out
I go up without you bringing me down
Such a rush
So now I'm staying to dance on my own
On my own
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move to

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
And all I know is
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
I'm not in love
