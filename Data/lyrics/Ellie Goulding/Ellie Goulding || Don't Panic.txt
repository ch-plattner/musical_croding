Bite down on your lip, take another sip (don't panic)
Start checking your phone, looking for the answers (don't panic)
Mind running obsessed, feeling paralyzed (don't panic)
When we watch you undress, fall into the night

Yeah we change, yeah we change, yeah we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break, yeah we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can't we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic (yeah)
Don't panic (yeah)

Been shattered before, everything breaks
Can't really be sure, of our mistakes (don't panic)
Come under my love, like an umbrella (don't panic)
I can make you feel good, yeah better than ever

Yeah we change, yeah we change, yeah we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break, yeah we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can't we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic (yeah)
Don't panic (yeah)

I got big dreams baby, I got big dreams baby
So don't you overcomplicate it
I got big dreams baby, I got big dreams baby
So don't you, don't you, overcomplicate it

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can't we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic (yeah)
Don't panic (yeah)

Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
