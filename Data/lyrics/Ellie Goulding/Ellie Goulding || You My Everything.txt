Could have given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I was one of those people
You, my everything

For what it's worth
For what it's worth
For what it's worth

You were my backbone when
My body ached with wearyness
You were my hometown when
My heart was filled with loneliness
Just as the dark was rising
I heard you close the door again
Just as the light turns off
I know who I dream of

Could have given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I was one of those people
You, my everything

You, my everything
You, my everything

You are my only hope
The truth that dealt the consequence
I know you don't feel the same
You're sensible but it doesn't make sense
I know I'm gonna weep my heart out
You know I'm gonna try much harder
But it isn't the shit in my head
Pulling me under this time

Could have given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I was one of those people
You, my everything

You, my everything
You, my everything

[2x]
(You, my everything
You, my everything
You, my everything)

Could have given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I was one of those people
You, my everything

You, my everything
You, my everything
