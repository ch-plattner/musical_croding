
Take cover
Signs don't show
You drove me off the road

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know
What you're running from
Would your bones have to break
And your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time
To hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

It's a shame you don't know
What you're running from
Would your bones have to break
And your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time
To hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

Wipe the mud spray from the face
Stop the engine
Stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face
Stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending that you're still breathing

It's a shame you don't know
What you're running from
Would your bones have to break
And your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time
To hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake
