I think I'll let fate just take me home
'Cause over pain, love is outgrown
I've never won a fight to understand
I just move as my heart commands

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognize
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Have you found peace with your mistakes?
Breathing on the glass as it breaks
Have you found the words to save her
And keep your heart out of danger?

I don't think I can take the violence
And lately I just need a voice I recognize
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognize
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
