[Chorus: Ellie Goulding (x4)]
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Now we're at square one
And we wait too long
Til' weâ€™re at square one

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding (x2)]

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I wonder how you'd feel if you were lost in my mind
Since you barely understand my thoughts sometimes
Little bit of depth and a little bit of God
Cause I swear that I be livin' in the dark sometimes
And it sets in here, nobody gets let in
'Til I let my emotions out on every single page and instrumental I'm left with
Shit, I wonder, will I ever really feel shit?
And if it all takes time and I ask why, will time eventually reveal this?
Cause... the remedy, I'm searchin' for the remedy
Cause I'm fucked up and my heart's just another ghost of my memory
Knock real hard on real real wood
Things still feel bad when they real real good
And my brain just a vessel and the knowledge suppose to heal
But the more you fuckin' know, less things feel real
Less things feel real, and the time shifts
And my mind shifts and ain't really anyone or anything I can really vibe with
Cause... I'm searchin', but I'm terrified
And by the time I find what I'm lookin' for, I'll be dead inside

[Outro: Angel Haze (Ellie Goulding)]
Cause part time love is the life round here
We're never done
(We're never done)
