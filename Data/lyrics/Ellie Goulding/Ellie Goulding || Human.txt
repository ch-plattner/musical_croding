Human, behave yourself,
You have burst at the seams
Let it all fall out
Open your mouth
Often I lie wide awake,
Think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them

Human, I wonder why you're a better make than I could ever build or create,
You know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me in the end
For I am not prepared,
I hope I will get the chance...

...to be someone,
To be human,
Look what we've done,
Look what we've done

I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be.

Human, I'm trying to come clean,
I will be a better me,
I will not drink until I'm dead
I'll make the most of it.
I don't know what it's like to be alive,
To say goodbye,
To cry a thousand times because my ears won't listen

Human, I'm trying not to lose my faith in you.
I've sussed out all that I've seen through,
I've sailed an ocean
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared,
I hope I will get the chance...

...to be someone
To be human, look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be.

I used to hear it all so loud, the sound of my heart breaking.
The truth is waiting to be found,
I trust that I will take it

I would give my life.
I would give my life.
I would give my life.
I would give my life.

I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be human
I would give my life to be.
