
I know it's not over, baby I worked this out for sure
It's gonna be colder, now you've forced open the door
I know you better than I ever have before
I know you

I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me when I was a shelter
So you're not heading home to me

We could be closer, we could be closer
We could be

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better

We'll take a long walk, down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk, see what conversation rouses when we're alone,
When we're alone, it could be home

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
