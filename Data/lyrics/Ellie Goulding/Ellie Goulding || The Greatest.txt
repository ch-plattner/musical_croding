
Just you and me
That true love, it was taken away from us so young
We're summer kids
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion
But we're still the one

We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

That sadness kills
Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now
Don't play it down
The time is now
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show
Don't let it go

Ohhoo...

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do
No one does it like we do
No one does it like we do

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do
Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do
