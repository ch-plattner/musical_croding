
When did life become so complicated?
Years of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is proof I fought and lived another day

When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe, in this place, up off the clouds

When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free, there's no need to come down
When your feet don't touch the ground

Everyday just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?
Running around pretending life's a play
It doesn't make the darkness go away

I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are all cried out
Make-believe, but count me out

Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth, "There's no use
If your head's in the clouds"

With my feet on solid earth
I can face the fates that hurt
And in time, I'll be fine
I'll come 'round

I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I say is true
You will be amazed
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe. In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free, there's no need, to come down
When your feet don't touch the ground
