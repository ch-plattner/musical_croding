
I've been filling in the blanks
You left me with your open hands
I never knew what I had to do
Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep
I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave into it
I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave in

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
