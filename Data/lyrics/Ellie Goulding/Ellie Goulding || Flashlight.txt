Do you remember boy when you were so cruel?
When you played the thief and I played the fool.
Gonna make you move, I’ll make you move, make you move
Spent so long crying over you, now I’m coming your way
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move, I’ll make you move, make you move
Tracing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand

I’ll make you move, I’ll make you move, I’ll make you move
I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
Cause I can’t lose.
I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I’m coming through.
I’ll make you run – oh, I’ll make you run – ah
I’ll make you run – oh, I’ll make you run – ah

Coming down on you with a flashing light, there’s nowhere to run
Baby you can’t hide
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
It’s too late now the table’s turned, there’s no going back and you’ll never learn
Unless I make you move
I’ll make you move, I’ll make you move, I’ll make you move
And you think I’m still broken-hearted, but you’ll never win the war you started
You'll never open your eyes

I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
Cause I can’t lose.
I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I’m coming through.

And you think I’m still broken-hearted but you will never win the war you started,
You'll never open your eyes
I’ll make you run, I’ll make you run, I’ll make you run, I’ll make you run, I’ll make you run, I’ll make you run
Faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
Cause I can’t lose.

I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I’m coming through.
I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
Cause I can’t lose.
I’ll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I’m coming through.
Get outta my way, get outta my way,
I’m coming through.
