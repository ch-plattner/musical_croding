
Suddenly we were friends,
guarding our country from traitors and new trends,
you are at the borders,
I am at the beaches examining exactly what the enemy teaches,
like presidents and pilots,
we turned our blind eye to letters over our heads, floating in the sky,
thousands of paper animals signalling danger,
they are evolving, and the world's a stranger,

No currency to drive us crazy,
no vehicles would drive us and make us lazy,
to make us lazy,
only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,
and I can't go back without a counter attack, and I can't turn around,
it's my mother's pride,

So close to somewhere else but we're not going there,
we scan the forest floors,
looking worse for wear,
for life outside of ours,
because we are too shallow and too brave to hide our scars and step in one's shadow,
I am protective over you and the stories we enact,
gain what from the smallest of contact,

No currency to drive us crazy,
no vehicles to drive us and make us lazy, to make us lazy,
only time I fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,
and when I see her, when I see her... everyday,

Only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear, and when I see her, when I see her everyday.
