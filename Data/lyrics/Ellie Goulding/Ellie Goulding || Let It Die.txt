
Headlights flashing, cold eyes
Know your bullets fly through the night
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright that it died
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright that it died

See change whispers in the waves
Watch my souls drown peacefully
And empires crumble to the shores
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright that it died
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright that it died

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright that it died
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright that it died
I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright that it died
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright that it died
