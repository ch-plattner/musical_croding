
Oh, oh, starry eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ah

Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels,
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ah

Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh

Next thing we're touching [x8]

Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes [x2]

Whoa oh oh ah ah [x3]
