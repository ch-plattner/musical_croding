Listen, I can hear the voice,
I need a helping hand,
Just to beat the void.
I need a mission,
A dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken,
And my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces
To scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears
You can hear the wind come in

But you can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go,
It's playing for you.
I can't stop this voice unraveling round me whatever I do.
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart beating for you,
However you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me.

Don't let it slip through your fingertips.
When there's a ghost,
Don't try to reason with it
'Cause now I'm tired, I'm wired,
So I won't miss a thing.
I wrote my words out to dry
And I've forgotten what to sing

But you can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unraveling round me whatever I do
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart beating for you,
However you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me.

If that's what it was to you,
Then that's what it was to me.
If that's what it was to you,
Then that's what it was to me.
If that's what it was to you,
Then that's what it was to me.

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart beating for you,
However you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart beating for you,
However you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me
Believe, believe, believe me
