Breathe your smoke into my lungs,
In the back of a car with you I stare into the sun,
Still not too old to die young,
But lovers hold on to everything,
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure 8,
I need you more than I can take,
You promise forever and a day,
And then you take it all away,
And then you take it all away

Place a kiss on my cheekbone,
When you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow,
But something tells me I'm not alone,
But lovers hold on to everything,
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure 8,
I need you more than I can take,
You promise forever and a day,
And then you take it all away,
And then you take it all away

So lovers hold on to everything,
And lovers hold on to anything,
So lovers hold on to everything,
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure 8,
I need you more than I can take,
You promise forever and a day,
And then you take it all away,

I chase your love around a figure 8,
I need you more than I can take,
You promise forever and a day,
And then you take it all away,
And then you take it all away
