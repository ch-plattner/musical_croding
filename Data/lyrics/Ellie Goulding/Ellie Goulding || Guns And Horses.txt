You're so quiet
But it doesn't faze me
You're on time
You move so fast, makes me feel lazy

Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open
Heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you
I would [x4]

Let's type words
Because they amount to nothing
Play it down
Pretend you can't take what you've found
But you found me
On a screen you sit at permanently

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open
Heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you
I would [x4]

It's time to come clean
And make sense of everything
It's time that we found out who we are
Cause when I'm standing here in the dark
I see your face in every star

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you
I would [x3]
I'd do it all for you, I'd do it all for you [x4]
