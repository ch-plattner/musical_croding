Shouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So, say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time, we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But, you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh, it's too much to risk
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it
Back, so it's no surprise
Everything you do, I over analyze
Breathe, in and out
Baby, give me something new to think about

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
