
Stones falling down
Roller coaster, heart bound
Fears overplayed
Two left feet, emergency

Wide open space
Catch my tail, fishing net
Fold up my frown,
Take the rage and smooth it out (out)

Stick to my skin,
Paper mach√© face to live in
Save you to paint
Watercolor your name

Read every page
(You will never have to feel that way again)
All your chains underwent
(You will never have to feel that way again)
Face your mistakes
(You will never have to feel that way again)
Press the dents, fighter plane

I held the fort and I swung my sword
I have muted the screams, I have broken the falls

Oh, I held the fort and I swung my sword
I have muted the screams, I have broken the falls

Fighter plane
Fighter plane
Fighter plane
Fighter plane

Fly away
