Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys [x2]

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door

Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

This is our luck baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, scale the map,
To get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost,
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys [x2]

In here the world won't bring us down
Our plan is gold dust
Out there a lonely girl could drown
In here we're frozen

Where did the people go?
My hands are empty
You're not the answer I should know
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe
(Oh, oh)
We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe
(Oh, oh)
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

We're under the sheets and you're killing me,
In our house made of paper, your words all over me,
We're under the sheets and you're killing me,
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before,
We're under the sheets and you're killing me,
In our house made of paper, your words all over me,
We're under the sheets and you're killing me,
(Oh you're killin me, your killin me!)

We're under the sheets and you're killing me,
In our house made of paper, your words all over me,
We're under the sheets and you're killing me.
(Killing me, killing me, killing me.)
Killing me, killing me, killing me.
