
People like to talk because they don't know what to say
Running from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses cause I only got today
I just keep moving, I just keep moving

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

Can you see my, see my headlights
You can come ride shotgun with me
Whatever you like, ever you like
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
I just keep on dancing
