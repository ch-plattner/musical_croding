I lost a signal and put you away
Swore upon my sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosened the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back it has to go

I keep calling your name
(Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close
But I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night
(Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close
I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

I found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you til a
Nightless day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

I keep calling your name
(Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close
But I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night
(Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close
I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms

Oh my goodness here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand
Cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling you up
Calling you up
Just to keep crawling to your arms
