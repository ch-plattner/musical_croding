I'll show you all of the places I'm dreaming of.
I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are seventeen, we have just begun...
I have love to fight for and then some
But you are the one,
The one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one.

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed...
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again
Again again again again again again again again again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defences
You are pulling me apart
Forever we're young and we are dying
And we will be spilling all our blood.
So I will take away my feelings
I will be an animal
An animal
An animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies like we tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky and I'll colour you
I want to draw on your skin again
Again again again again again again again again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defences
You are pulling me apart
Forever we're young and we are dying
And we will be spilling all our blood.
So I will take away my feelings
I will be an animal
An animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we're young and we are dying
And we will be spilling all our blood.
So I will take away my feelings
I will be an animal
An animal
