
Your arms around me come undone
Makes my heart beat like a drum
See the panic in my eyes
Kiss me only when I cry

Cause you always want what you're running from
And you know this is more than you can take

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh your touch, so bittersweet, ah ah ah ah
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Your cheek is softly by the sun
Makes my heart beat like a drum
I know it hurts you, I know it burns you
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
Look into me, tell me why you're crying I need to know

Cause you always want what you're running from
And it's always been that way, oh oh

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh your touch, so bittersweet, ah ah ah ah
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Cause you always want what you're running from

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh your touch, so bittersweet, ah ah ah ah
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
