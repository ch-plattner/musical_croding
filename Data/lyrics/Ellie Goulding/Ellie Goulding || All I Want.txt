All I want is nothing more, hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more, to die a happy woman I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye, I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night, alone without you by my side.

If you love me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody like you.
Like you. Like you. You.

'Cause you brought out the best of me,
A part of me I'd never seen,
You took my soul and wiped it clean,
Our love was made for movie screens.

If you love me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, find somebody.

If you love me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody like you.
