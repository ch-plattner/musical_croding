If a fish swam out of the ocean, grew legs and started walking
And the apes climbed out from the trees, and grew tall and started talking
And the stars fall out of the sky, and my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why, you set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here, then the stars don't even matter
Now I feel too tall, we all fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here, then I don't want to be either
I want be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black gold

I looked up into the night sky and see I saw an eye staring back
And all around these golden beacons I see nothing but black
I feel a wave of something beyond though, I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation, then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here, then the stars don't even matter
Now I feel too tall, we all fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here, then I don't want to be either
I want be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black gold

I want to be next to you

'Cause if you're not really here,
then the stars don't even matter
Now I feel too tall, we all fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here,
then I don't want to be either I want be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black gold
