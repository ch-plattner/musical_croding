
I do what I love
I do what I love and I love what I do

How many times do I need to
Need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good
And I know that I'm strong
But my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing
See you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse

But I got to move on, baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work
I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
Because I was born free
I ain't taking shit

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

How many hits do you need for
Me to get it in you
Get it in you
And I'm strong and my heart
In my heart it won't change
For anyone or anything
And if you're crying about your lover
Because your lover is a dick
This will get you over it

But you got to move on, baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work
I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
Because I was born free
I ain't taking this

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

I do what I love and I love what I do
I do what I love and I love what I do
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

I do what I love and I love what I do
