I am a mosaic
That was found at
The bottom of your garden
I'm just wondering but the cracks begin to show
Look closely and then you'll know
Then you'll know

I am a beauty that once was
Delicate intrigue, never something special
But never out of your league, I've
Battled with this twice now
He came to me said
"here's how"
Spoke a single line
While we dance in our scene
I'll just die in your arms
And my life is complete

I am a mosaic
That was found when you didn't know any better 
I am broken now [x3]
And image that's scattered
Around and [x5] around
A million ways that I, I
Didn't have to hurt [x3]
Battled with this twice
And now he came to me, said
"here's how"
Spoke a single line
We danced in our scene
I'll just die in your arms and my life is complete

Cradled your legs
And took to your feet
You're the strongest love
I ever did meet
Spoke a single line
While we danced in our scene
I'll just die in your arms and my life is complete
