
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...

I’m living on the wild side
I’ve never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You’re my only bridge

And I feel the fear in me
And I don’t wanna fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it can’t be beat

If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...

If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...
If you lock me out...

If you lock...
If you lock...
If you lock...
If you lock...
If you lock...

Will you know who I am?
Will you know who you are?

Will you know who I am?
Will you know who you are?

I think I’ve been praying
The lights won’t go out
My blood is getting colder
As I follow this road down

If you lock me out... (There won’t be anything to hold)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anything to hold on to)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anyone in the ending)

If you lock me out... (There won’t be anything to hold)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anything to hold on to)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out... (There won’t be anyone in the ending)
