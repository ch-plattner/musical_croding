
Is this our world?

I look in the mirror
I can't get over you
Is this our world?
Is this someone else?
Is this someone else?

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
My head full of terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the fires I started
I try to be nearer
To where you are
To where you are

Are we star-crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Wash the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You're in my heart
In my heart

Are we star-crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire
