
This is new
Feels unused
I've never met anyone like you

Frightening
Feeling naked
Sense in searching something sacred

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll wait for you... maybe

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me- I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll wait for you... for you... maybe
I'll forget you not... I'll forget you not
I'll wait for you maybe

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

Go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
