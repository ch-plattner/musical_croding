Sooner or later I'll be heading home
Sooner or later I'll be on my own
June into summer; I'll wear out my shoes
June into summer; got nothing to lose

Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Move in the sun 'til I burn all my ties
Maybe they're scratching the watery eyes
I think I've been waiting for this all my life
Coldest dark kisses left frozen in time

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
