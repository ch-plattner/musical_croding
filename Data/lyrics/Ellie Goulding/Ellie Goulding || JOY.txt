Stood in the rain and watched you go
I feel a lump in my throat
And this is far from joy

I never seemed to learn
That high makes things harder
That high I get from you

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart

I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favorite ride ooh hey hoh

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart

And then you see, oooh

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart
