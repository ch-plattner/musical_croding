If I ever had a wish in the whole world
I would’ve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would’ve played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company

But You gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And You gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won’t lose them

Now I found my feet, count to 1, 2, 3
And I’m taking off tonight, now I’m free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I and I and I

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city
I fall on my knees for my, for my city
We’re going off the dream in my, in my city
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city

Rolling down the streets in my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart played down
I think I’ll get a job with stealing people’s thunder
But the folks back home I’ll make them vouch

You gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, You gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don’t wanna lose them
I don’t wanna lose them

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city
I fall on my knees for my, for my city
We’re going off the dream in my, in my city
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city

Shoulders ache for wanted wings
My city shakes, the fear in me

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city
I fall on my knees for my, for my city
We’re going off the dream in my, in my city
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city
