
I've been too numb to understand
I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
But I've been bulletproof, I'm staring at the sun

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crushing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crushing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
