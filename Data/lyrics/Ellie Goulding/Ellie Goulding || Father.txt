
Opened up a box of you,
Piece of paper or two,
With my name written on it, and a question mark
Who is this girl that I’ve made?
‘Cause I’ve been kept in the dark

And I’ve seen you once, Father
In the fear of your belts and leather,
And you were just about to tempter,
There was distance, 
You’re my spout resistance
And I cant believe that you still don’t know me,
‘Cause I am a mystery

So I separated all the things that I have hated,
With the victories I’ve won,
And the biggest one was you,
You don’t know my street or the size of my feet or,
Or the time it took to grow,
‘Cause Father these are things you should know,
These are things you should know,

Knocked the breath right out of you,
But what’s a brown-eyed girl to do?
When her future lies on chasing paper, 
And all I get from you is; “You’re so clever" and "I’ll see you later.”
And I just cant hide my frustration,
When there’s so much more you could have done,
Like given me hope and attention instead of ignore,
No I don’t mind, no, I don’t mind because he is just a boy,
Cause we are children,
We are merely children,
And he is just a boy,

So I separated all the things that I have hated,
With the victories I’ve won,
And the biggest one was you,
You don’t know my street or the size of my feet or,
Or the time it took to grow,
‘Cause these are things you should know
