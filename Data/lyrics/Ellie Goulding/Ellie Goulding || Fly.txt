In the window
Faces staring right past me
They're on a date, feeling happy
And I go in there and sit with them
Make them laugh
And be normal
For an hour and a half
Someone's tired
But not mine

'Cause I just fly, fly, fly
Only fly, fly, fly
When things are moving so fast
You don't have to take them in
When you're falling up high
You don't even have to think about it
About it

Know every station off by heart
Never get off 
Just go back to the start of my journey
And I'm never as young as I want to be
I think I'll never worry 

If I fly, fly, fly
I'll just fly, fly, fly 
When things are moving so fast
You don't have to take them in
When you're falling up high
You don't even have to think about it
About it

Some day the sky will run out
The ground will pull me back down
Back to thinking straight
Never being late for love that I haven't found

But maybe I should try
Maybe I should try

I bet he's heavy
I feel weak
Talk to people
But they don't speak
Always moving, but I still don't know where I'm going

But that's okay, because I'll fly, fly, fly
I'll just fly, fly, fly
When things are moving so fast
You don't have to take them in
When you're falling up high
You don't even have to think

I just fly
