Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Love to you, babe
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me
