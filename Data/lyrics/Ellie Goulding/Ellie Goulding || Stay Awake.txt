Take my fate in your hands,
We've got a lot that hasn’t even began
Something is calling us,
We’re breaking free,
I’m curious,
I need to see.

Like a flash before our eyes,
We're already into the night,
And if it feels like we’re dreaming,
Believe it, believe it.

(Yeah)

We don't have to wait 'til the morning,
The sun will never go down.
And we’ll be this way forever,
We've got to take it now,
(Yeah)
Just stay awake, stay awake,
You can follow us to paradise,
Just stay awake, stay awake.

Bring me down, side by side,
While our reflections make our bodies collide.
So full of energy, nothing to hide,
No need to sleep, we come alive,
And if we’re gonna take this ride,
We can go wherever we like
And if it feels like we’re dreaming,
Believe it, believe it.

(Yeah)
We don't have to wait 'til the morning,
The sun will never go down.
And we’ll be this way forever,
We've got to take it now,
(Yeah)
Just stay awake, stay awake,
You can follow us to paradise,
Just stay awake, stay awake.

Believe it.

Take my fate in your hands,
We've got a lot that hasn't even began
Something is calling us,
We’re breaking free,
I’m curious,
I need to see.

We're going on a journey
It was over like a flash before our eyes
We're going on a journey
It was over like a flash before our eyes
We're already into the night

Like a flash before our eyes,
We're already into the night,
And if it feels like we’re dreaming,
Believe it, believe it.

(Yeah)
We don't have to wait 'til the morning,
The sun will never go down.
And we’ll be this way forever,
We've got to take it now,
(Yeah)
Just stay awake, stay awake,
You can follow us to paradise,
Just stay awake, stay awake.
