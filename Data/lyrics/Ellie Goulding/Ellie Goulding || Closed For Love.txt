
In the quiet
I heard a siren
Passing by
I shut my eyes

Are you hurting?
I lock my door
I'm closed for love
Don't wanna cry no more

Who will kiss my tears away?
You only made them fall
And it's crazy to hold on
What I'm holding on is gone
So now I'm closed for love

Who will kiss my tears away?
You only ever made them fall
So now I'm closed for love

You dropped me
To the ground
You stood right by
Said I should fly

Always flirting
Smiles soul
Those stroke my heart
It doesn't beat no more

And who will kiss my tears away?
You only made them fall
And it's crazy to hold on
When you won't open
So now I'm closed for love

Who will kiss my tears away?
You only ever made them fall
So now I'm closed for love

Friday morning
I had no warning
Friday night
I lost the fight

Were you aiming?
I wasn't sure
If I had first
I'm glad my back was turned

And who kiss my tears away?
You only made them fall
And it's crazy to hold on
When you won't open
So now I'm closed for love

Who will kiss my tears away?
You only ever made them fall
So now I'm closed for love
Who will kiss my tears away?
You only ever made them fall
You only ever made them fall
You only ever made them fall
