Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out, of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let the yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days, of yore
Faithful friends, who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more

Someday soon, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through, somehow

And have yourself a merry little Christmas, now
