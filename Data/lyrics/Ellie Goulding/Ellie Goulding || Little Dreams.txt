If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch, I couldn't try to
move. My mind is on you, my mind is on
you

If the streetlight smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch. Turn the glass
into stars and your face is the moon
And the night turns to you, cos my mind is
on you

You've got me caught in a place
Panic for a minute, got my brain in a
daze, I wish you weren't in it, there are so
many ways to lose your attention.
You can break everything but so what I
can take anything, I can take anything,
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me, I'd smile
and fold my arms, I'd feel nothing new,
because my mind is on you

And if the floor gave way to my shoes,
I wouldn't try to fly, I can't explain what it
would feel, I just feel you

You've get me caught in a place
Panic for a minute, got my brain in a 
daze I wish you weren't in it, there are
so many ways to lose your attention.
You can break everything but so what?
I can take anything

You're the heat in my bones, but you
break me with stones. You're the heat in
my bones, but you break me with stones
If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch, I couldn't try to
move. My mind is on you, my mind is on
you
