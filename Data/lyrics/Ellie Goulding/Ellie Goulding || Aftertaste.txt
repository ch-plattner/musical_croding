Hold me like nobody else does
Do I get the best of your love?
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from?
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
Remember love is a game, love is a game

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won’t hurt
Said I’ll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss
Come on, give me your heart and your head
Make you conscious never resist, never resist

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won’t hurt
Said I’ll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
