
Reaching higher than towers
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This is was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night

And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer two years ago

You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you

We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer two years ago

You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

Two years ago
About you, about you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you, about you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Two years ago

I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
