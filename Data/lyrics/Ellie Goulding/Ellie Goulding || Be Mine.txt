
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
Just a sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
As I'm watching you walk away

And now you're gone it's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside

And now you're gone it's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

And you never were
and you never will be mine
No you were never were
and you never will be mine

For the first time there is no mercy in your eyes
And the cold winds hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away, away
And I am helpless sometimes 
Wishing's just no good
Cause you don't see me like I wish you would

Cause you never were and you never will be mine
No you never were and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize every time we meet
But you always keep passing me by
But you never were and you never will be mine
No you were never were and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
But you never were and you never will be mine
