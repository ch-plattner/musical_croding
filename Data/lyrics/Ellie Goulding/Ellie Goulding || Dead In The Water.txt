
If I was not myself
And you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth
'Cause I can hardly breathe

When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feet brace themselves

I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see, can't you see?

You've seen this all before
Life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see, can't you see?

Oh yeah
I'm dead in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see, can't you see?

I'm dead in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see, can't you see?
