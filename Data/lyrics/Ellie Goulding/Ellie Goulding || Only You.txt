Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

Only you can see the emptiness I feel
When you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees

When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees

Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
Only you
Only you

Only you can see the emptiness I feel
When you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees

When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Only you

Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

Only you...

Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
