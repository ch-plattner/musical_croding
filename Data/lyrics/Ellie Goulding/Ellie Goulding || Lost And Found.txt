
Gotta love this field and the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds though it's late July
You don't even try; still, you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

Near the countryside but I just forgot
All the things that matter I forget a lot
I get so caught up in the city cloud
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run, take me to the bus
But don't let me go, no, don't let me on
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found
