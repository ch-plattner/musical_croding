I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?

When I look into your eyes
Boy, I'm feeling delirious
But you know this is serious
I'm sticking to you like glue
Only see you now and then, but I know we could have it all
Because before I was cynical, baby you were just cool

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be, I could be, I could be there
If only you’d let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhere

Still looking up and down while you're being mysterious
I see really big things for us
We just need to break through, break through, break through
Everything that you say, god I wish I had said it first
And forgetting I had ever hurt
Your love is pulling me through, me through, me through

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong

You are all I want
So take me home
The more you been thinking about us
Open up, don't let me go
The more you been thinking about

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask?
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be, I could be, I could be there
If only you’d let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhere
