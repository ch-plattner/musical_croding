
Oh Jesus, son of God, so full of grace and truth
The Father's saving word, so wonderful are You
The angels longed to see and prophets searched to find
The glory we have seen revealed

You shone upon the Earth but who will understand?
You came unto Your own but who will recognize?
Your birth was prophesied, for You were the Messiah
Who came and walked upon the Earth

Your glory we have seen, the one and only King
And now You're living in our hearts

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us

In You all things were made and nothing without You
In Heaven and on Earth all things are held in You
And yet You became flesh, living as one of us
Under the shadow of the cross

Where, through the blood You shed
You have made peace again
Peace for the world that God so loves

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us

And yet You became flesh, living as one of us
Under the shadow of the cross

Where, through the blood you shed
You have made peace again
Peace for the world that God so loves

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us

Light of the world, light of the world
Light of the world, You shine upon us
