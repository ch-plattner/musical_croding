
Come, let us worship and bow down
Before the Lord Most Holy
Before the King of Glory

Come and lay your burdens down
Before the Friend who's faithful
Before the One who's able

For He is our God
And we are His people
(Yes) He is our God
And we will never be forsaken

Come, let us lift our voice in praise
Unto the Rock of Ages
Unto the God who saves us

Come and glorify His name
All the earth together
All the saints forever

You are our God
And we are Your people
You are our God
And we will be with You forever
