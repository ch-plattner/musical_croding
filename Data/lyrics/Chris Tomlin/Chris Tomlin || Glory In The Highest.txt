
You are the first, You go before
You are the last, Lord, You're the encore
Your name's in lights for all to see
The starry host declare Your glory

Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest

Apart from You there is no God
Light of the world, the brightened morning star
Your name will shine for all to see
You are the one, You are my glory

Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest

And no one else could ever compare
To You, Lord
All the earth together declares

Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
To You, Lord, to You, Lord

Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
To You, Lord, to You, Lord

All the earth will sing Your praise
The moon and stars, the sun and rain
Every nation will proclaim
You are God and You will reign

Glory, glory Hallelujah
Glory, glory to You, Lord
Glory, glory Hallelujah
Hallelujah
