No reputation, no stately bearing
No palace bed for royalty
But a star in the Heavens, a sign full of wonder
Announcing the coming of the King of kings

Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come
Through the love of a virgin's womb
Son of God, Son of man, born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life

A throne in a manger, the cross in a cradle
The hidden revealing this glorious plan
Of a Child who would suffer, a Child who would conquer
The sin of every woman, the sin of every man

Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come
Through the love of a virgin's womb
Son of God, son of man, born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life

Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come
Through the love of a virgin's womb
Son of God, Son of man
You were born that we may have life

Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come
Through the love of a virgin's womb
Son of God, Son of man, born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life

Rejoice, o world, rejoice
Rejoice, o world, Hallelujah, the Savior has come
Rejoice, o world, join with the angels
Rejoice, o world, rejoice

Rejoice, o world, for the King of kings
And the Lord of lords
Rejoice, o world, a Savior is born
Who brings us life and brings peace

Born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life
