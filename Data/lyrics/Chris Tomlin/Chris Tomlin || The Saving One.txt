There is a Name
That echoes on eternal shores
With all believers who have come before
Jesus Christ forevermore

Your love is amazing
Grace never fails me
You are the saving One
You reach from the heavens
Hope of the nations
You are the saving One

There is a light
Forever beautiful and bright
Undivided by the darkest night
The Morning Star Jesus Christ

The rivers clap their hands
The mountains bow their heads
And all creation cries
Your praise will never end

And this is all for You
You're making all things new
Let all creation cry
Your praise will never end
Your praise will never end
Your praise will never end

There is a Name
That echoes on eternal shores
All of heaven and the earth adore
Jesus Christ forevermore
