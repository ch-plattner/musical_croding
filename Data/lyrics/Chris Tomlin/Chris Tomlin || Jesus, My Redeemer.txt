
You traded riches to run to my rescue
Oh, my redeemer
You take the pieces and turn them to praises
Oh, my Redeemer
Oh, my Redeemer

Love I cannot deny
Sure as the morning light
Jesus, my Redeemer

You paid my ransom
You chose to suffer
Oh, my Redeemer
Oh, my Redeemer

Love I cannot deny
Sure as the morning light
Jesus, my Redeemer
Now I am not ashamed
To You be the highest praise
Jesus, my Redeemer
My Redeemer

No other one so glorious
You outshine the sun
No other love like Jesus
You outshine the sun
