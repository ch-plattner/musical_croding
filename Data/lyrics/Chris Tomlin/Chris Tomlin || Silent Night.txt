
Silent night, Holy night,
all is calm, all is bright, 
round yon Virgin mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love’s pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing ”Hallelujah!”
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!
