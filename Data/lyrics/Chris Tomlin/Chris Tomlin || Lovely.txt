I watch Your wonders fill the sky
Over the mountains reaching high
The same majesty floods my life
I stand in awe

Lovely, there is none more lovely
In all the universe, there is no one lovelier
Worthy, there is none more worthy
I try to find the words, there's so much more Your worthy of

Up on the cross with open arms
The love of God reaches far
The same majesty floods my heart
I stand in awe

As long as I live, I'll praise You
Name above all, be lifted high
All of my days, I worship You
I worship You

Lovely, You are lovely
There is no one, there is no one more worthy
You are worthy
I try to find the words, there is no one lovelier
