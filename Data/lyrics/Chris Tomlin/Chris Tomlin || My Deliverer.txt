
I will wait for You to move 
For Your mighty hand to save 
When the trouble water rise 
You are my hiding place 
You are my hiding place 

You walls are salvation 
Your gates are praise 

My Deliverer 
My Deliverer 
My Deliverer 
Is the Lord 

Who is like You mighty God 
Who can take me from Your hand 
As I walk with You in freedom 
You're the Rock on which I stand 
You're the Rock on which I stand
