
Well I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
& I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love

c'mon everybody dance
Everybody dance

My heart is bursting Lord to
To tell of all you've done
Of how've you changed my life
And wiped away the past

Well, I want to shout it out
From every roof top sing
For now I know
That God is for me, not against me

I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
& I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love

My heart is bursting Lord to
To tell of all you've done
Of how've you changed my life
And wiped away the past

Well I want to shout it out
From every roof top sing
For now I know
That God is for me, not against me

Everybody's singin' now
Cuz we're so happy
Yeah,
Everybody's dancin' now
Cuz we're so happy

If only I could see your face,
See you smiling over us
And unseen angels celebrate
Hey! The joy is in this place
Yeah,
The joy is in this place

I could sing unending songs
Of how you've saved my soul
& I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
& I could sing unending songs
Of how you've saved my soul
& I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
