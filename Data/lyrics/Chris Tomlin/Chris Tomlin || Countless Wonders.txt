
You reign in endless power above the world You made
Across the sky is written Your majesty and praise
And still You move in mercy and hear the humble heart
For every soul that’s searching, Jesus there You are

Your beauty fills the sky
Your glory reigns in brilliant light
Great God of countless wonders
I will lift my eyes

The mysteries of heaven and all Your works displayed
Every star, every ocean, the universe proclaims
For every sun that rises, Your faithfulness to me
Like the changing of the seasons, like the river to the sea

No one can fathom all Your mighty works O God
Just one glimpse of You and I am overcome
You open up Your hand and pour out once again
Your everlasting love

Your beauty fills the sky
Your glory reigns in brilliant light
Great God of countless wonders
I will lift my eyes [repeat]
