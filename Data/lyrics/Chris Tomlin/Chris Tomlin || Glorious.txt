We lift our hands in praise to You
We lift in our hearts in worship to You, Lord
You Lord
We lift our voice to You and sing
Our greatest love will ever be You, Lord

Glorious
Over us
You shall reign
Glorious

There is a King that we adore
With humble hearts we bow before You, Lord
There is a place we long to be
Face to face we long to see You, Lord

Majesty and power
Are Yours alone forever
