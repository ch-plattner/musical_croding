
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We know living in your freedom
living in your freedom, see your glory
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty

We’re yours, yours is the kingdom
We’re yours, yours is the kingdom

You are the fire through the night
You are the flame that burns inside
We need your presence more than anything

More than just a song to sing
More than words or offerings
We need your presence more than anything

You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need 
You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need 

We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We know living in your freedom
living in your freedom, see your glory
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty

We’re yours, yours is the kingdom
We’re yours, yours is the kingdom
yours is the kingdom

Call us closer to your heart
Lead us Lord to where you are
We need your presence more than anything

You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need 
You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need 

We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We know living in your freedom
living in your freedom, see your glory
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty

We’re yours, yours is the kingdom
We’re yours, yours is the kingdom
yours is the kingdom

You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need 
You’re all that we want 
You’re all that we need
