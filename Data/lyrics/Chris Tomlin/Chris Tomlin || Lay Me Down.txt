With this heart open wide 
From the depths from the heights
I will bring a sacrifice
With these hands lifted high  
Hear my song, hear my cry
I will bring a sacrifice  
I will bring a sacrifice

[Chorus:]
I lay me down I’m not my own
I belong to you alone 
Lay me down, lay me down
Hand on my heart this much is true
There’s no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down

Letting go of my pride  
Giving up all my rights
Take this life and let it shine   
Take this life and let it shine

[Chorus:]
I lay me down I’m not my own
I belong to you alone 
Lay me down, lay me down
Hand on my heart this much is true
There’s no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down

[Bridge:]
It will be my joy to say Your will Your way
It will be my joy to say Your will Your way
It will be my joy to say Your will Your way always
