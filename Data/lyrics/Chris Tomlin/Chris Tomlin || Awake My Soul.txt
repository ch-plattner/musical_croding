[Chris Tomlin:]
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
I come alive, I'm alive when You breathe on me
I come alive, I'm alive when You breathe on me

[Chorus:]
Awake, awake, awake my soul,
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul

Speak to me, Word of God, speak to me
Speak to me, Word of God, speak to me
I come alive, I'm alive when you speak to me
I come alive, I'm alive when you speak to me

[Chorus:]
Awake, awake, awake my soul,
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul

[Lecrae:]
Then He said to me,
Prophesy to these bones and say to them,
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones,
I will make breath enter you,
And you will come alive.
So I prophesied as I was commanded.
As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound,
And the bones came together, bone to bone.
And I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them,
And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
Then He said to me,
Prophesy to the breath,
Prophesy, son of man, and say to it,
Come from the four winds of breath and breathe.

[Chorus:]
Awake, awake, awake my soul,
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Awake, awake, awake my soul,
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul

[Lecrae:]
Yeah, I'm not alone, I realize
I breathe out, I come alive
Your Word gives life to my dry bones
Your breath tells death it can ride on
Awake me, make me a living stone,
A testament to your throne, I
I'm nothing without You, I'm on my own
The only One who satisfies my soul
