His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever

Sing praise, sing praise

With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever

Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever

Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever

Sing praise, sing praise [4x]

Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us

Forever You are faithful
Forever You are strong
Forever You are with us
