[Verse 1:]
You came down, from heaven's throne
This earth You formed, was not Your home
A love like this, the world had never known
A crown of thorns, to mock your name
Forgiveness fell upon Your face
A love like this, the world had never known

[Chorus:]
On the altar of our praise
Let there be no higher name
Jesus Son of God
You laid down Your perfect life
You are the sacrifice
Jesus Son of God
You are Jesus Son of God

[Verse 2:]
You took our sin
You bore our shame
You rose to life
You defeated the grave
A love like this, the world has never known
[Repeat]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Be lifted higher
Than all You've overcome
Your name be louder
Than any other song
There is no power
That can come against Your love
The cross was enough
The cross was enough

The cross was enough
The cross was enough
