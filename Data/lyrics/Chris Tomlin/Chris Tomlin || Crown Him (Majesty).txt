
Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own;
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

[Chorus:]
Majesty, Lord of all
Let every throne before Him fall
The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forever - more.

[Verse 2:]
Crown Him Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save;
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die.

[Bridge:]
All hail, Redeemer, hail
For He has died for me
His praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity.
