This is the dream, a dream for the world to see You
A dream for the world to know You, to love Your name

Lift up a shout, lift up a cry to shake the ground
Shout and the walls are coming down
Yeah, we're running after You

Like a rolling stone, like a runaway train
No turning back, no more yesterdays
My heart is free, no chains on me
God, You raise me up, up from the grave
The cross before, I'm on my way
My heart is free, no chains on me

Now is the time, now is the time for freedom
Abandoned by cold religion, my heart on fire
We hear the sound, the sound of revival coming
The sound of Your people rising
Yeah, we're running after You

The walls are coming down
