[Verse 1]
You're the God of this City 
You're the King of these people 
You're the Lord of this nation 
You are 

[Verse 2]
You're the Light in this darkness 
You're the Hope to the hopeless 
You're the Peace to the restless 
You are 

There is no one like our God 
There is no one like our God 

[Chorus]
For greater things have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done in this City 
Greater thing have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done in this City 

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]

There is no one like our God 
There is no one like our God 

[Chorus]
For greater things have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done in this City 
Greater things have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done here 

There is no one like our god 
There is no one like our God 

[Chorus]
Greater things have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done in this City 
Greater things have yet to come 
And greater things are still to be done here
