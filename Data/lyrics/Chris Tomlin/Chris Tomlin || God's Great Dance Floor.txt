
I'm coming back to the start
Where You found me
I'm coming back to Your heart
Now I surrender
Take me
This is all I can bring

I'm coming back to the start
Our God is freedom
And here we feel Your heart
Your heartbeat for us
Take me
This is all I can bring

[Chorus:]
You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts: let the future begin
Let the future begin

Take me
This is all I can bring

[Chorus:]
You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts: let the future begin

I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor
God's great dance floor!
