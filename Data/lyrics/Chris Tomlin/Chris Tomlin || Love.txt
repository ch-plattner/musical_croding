[With Watoto Children's Choir]

When our hope is hard to find 
And our faith is in decline 
We need a cause to stand behind - love 
We all want the way it feels 
Time it comes and time it steals 
What remains, what is real - love 

[Chorus:] 
There is love 
There is forgiveness 
There is love in times of need 
When life is cold there is a promise 
You will never go without... 
There is love 

It heals the sick 
Comforts the weak 
Breaks the proud 
Raises the meek 
In this life no guarantees... 

Love is the answer 
Love will find a way 
When we love one another 
It's a brighter day 

O-kwa-ga-la-kwe, 
Ku-singa-byoo-na, 
Bwe-twa-ga-la-na-o-lu-na-ku-lu-suu-fu
