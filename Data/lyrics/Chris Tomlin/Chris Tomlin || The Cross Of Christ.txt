
Son of God
Son of man
His life poured out for all

See His hands
See His scars
His love can't be denied

Our God is high and lifted up

It is the cross my only plea
The blood He shed delivers me
Our Saviour's arms are open wide
A love so great the cross of Christ

Every debt
All we owe
He bears it as His own

Brought to life
We are free
To live in Christ alone

See the Lamb of God
See the Father's love
All to Jesus we owe
He paid it all
