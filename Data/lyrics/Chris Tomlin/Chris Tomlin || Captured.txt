I heard your echo in the canyon
upon the timberline
You said these mountains were your invention
And so was this heart of mine
I heard you whisper on the water,
there on the mighty sea
You spoke of love deep as the ocean
When You spoke of Your love for me

I am loved by the Father
I am loved by the Son
It is love that has captured
The heart of this wayward one
I heard your laughter in the sunrise,
amidst the morning birds
A song of freedom for all creation
And you sang me every word
I heard you singing in the silence,
a simple melody
Words of love, O I can hear it
My Father is very fond of me
