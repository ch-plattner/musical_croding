Come, Thou long expected Jesus 
Born to set Thy people free; 
From our fears and sins release us, 
Let us find our rest in Thee. 
Israel's strength and consolation, 
Hope of all the earth Thou art; 
Dear desire of every nation, 
Joy of every longing heart. 

Born Thy people to deliver, 
Born a child and yet a King, 
Born to reign in us forever, 
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring. 
By Thine own eternal Spirit 
Rule in all our hearts alone; 
By Thine all sufficient merit, 
Raise us to Thy glorious throne. 

By Thine all sufficient merit, 
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
