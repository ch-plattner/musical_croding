
I open my mouth and You speak for me 
You move the mountains and roll back the sea 

I will not afraid 
I will never be ashamed 
For You are with me 
You are with me 

I've seen enough to know 
That You're my only hope 
I don't want to go 
If You're not with me 

We open our hands and You reach for us 
You are the motion of the universe
