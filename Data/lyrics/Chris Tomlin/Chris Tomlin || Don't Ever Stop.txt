[Chorus:]
Whatever is true
Whatever is right
Whatever is pure
Whatever is light
Lead me in the way everlasting
Don't ever stop
Don't ever stop

You alone I will seek with all my hearts
Set my eyes set my mind upon Your word
Jesus, You are the way and I will follow
You are the way, the only way and I will follow.

[Chorus]

I will walk in the path of Your commands
In the strength of Your name God I will live
Jesus, You are the way 
You are the way and I will follow,
You are the way, the only way and I will follow.

[Chorus]

I don't wanna live outside Your ways
I don't wanna miss Your heart for me
You're the way
You're the way.

[Chorus]
