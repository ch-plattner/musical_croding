Romans 16:19 says!
[2x]

Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil
Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil

[Chorus:]
And the God of Peace will soon crush Satan
God will crush him underneath your feet!
And the God of Peace will soon crush Satan
God will crush him underneath your feet!

Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil
Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil
