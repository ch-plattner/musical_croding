
You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' 'out any warnin'
Gotta get ready to go
You say you went out late last evenin'
Did a lot of drinkin'
Come home stinkin'
And you went and fell asleep on the floor
And then your lady comes and finds you asleepin'
Starts in to weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'
And you better get your ass out the door

Ain't no crime
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
It ain't no crime
Well, everybody gets that way some time
It ain't no crime. Ooooh.

You got to open your eyes in the mornin'
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
Gots'ta get ready to go
Well now you tell me you love somebody
And you'll love 'em forever
You may love 'em forever
But you won't like 'em all of the time
Well now you tell me you need somebody for the rest of your life
You might have somebody
But you won't want 'em ev'ryday

Ain't no crime
Well it's just human nature
Happens all the time
It ain't no crime
Well don't think twice about it
Get it off your mind
Ain't no crime. Ooooh.

Ain't no crime
Well, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
I say it ain't no crime
Well it's just human nature
Happens all the time
It ain't no crime. Ooooh.
You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' 'out any warnin'
You gotta get ready to go

And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'
The grass keeps growin'
You gotta keep goin'
And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Woooh.
