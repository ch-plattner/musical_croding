I met a gin soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride (yeah)
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind (no)

It's the Honky Tonk Women (yeah)
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
As naked as the day that I will die
The sailors they're so charming there in Paris
But they just don't seem to sail you off my mind (yeah)

It's the Honky Tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

(yeah)
It's the Honky Tonk women, yeah
And give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues (my my)
It's the Honky Tonk women, yeah
And give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
