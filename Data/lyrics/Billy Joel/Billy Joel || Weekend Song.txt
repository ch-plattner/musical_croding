This back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keeping me alive doin' nine to five
And I ain't got nothin to show
Pretty soon I'll be leavin'
With the wages I'm receivin'
But I know it's gonna be all right
Come on, babe, and take me away
We got some money to spend tonight

Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it

Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Seven long years for the same corporation
And I ain't got nothin' to show
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even
But I know it's gonna be all right
I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes
We got some money to spend tonight

Oh, I don't wanna stand here and sound accusin'
Everybody does their share of losin'
If I'm gonna lose it I might as well be doin' it right

Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it

Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keepin' me alive doin' nine to five
And I ain't got nothin' to show
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even
But I know it's gonna be all right
Come on, babe, and take me away
We got some money to spend tonight
Come on, babe, take me away
We got some money to spend tonight
