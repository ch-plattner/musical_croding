Little Geo is a friend of mine
We get some money and we buy a cheap wine
Sit on the corner and have a holiday
Hide the bottle when the cop goes by
Talk about women and lie, lie, lie
Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away

Wait for mamma to turn out the light
Crawl on the the roof and then hit the night
I should be sleeping but tonight I just can't stay
I've given everybody so much time
Now I need a moment that's mine
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

Angelina save a place for me
I've been livin' someone else's life and now I've got to be free
Turn your transistor on and let the music play
I try to keep the family satisfied
But there's gotta be more to life than just try, try, try
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away
