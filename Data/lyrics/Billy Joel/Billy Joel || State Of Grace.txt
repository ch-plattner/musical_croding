
There you go, slipping away into a state of grace
I know the look that comes across your face
It's so familiar to me
Here I am, trying to keep you in my line of sight
I'm never certain that you read me right
Sometimes you don't want to see
Here we are, both of us know we're in love
But that isn't always enough
I never could rise above it all, down I fall

But darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace
Granted, this world is not a perfect place
Still it's the world that I'm in
Here I am talking while you don't hear a word I say
Knowing you're watching me from far away
Somewhere that I've never been

Don't you see, you lived a different life than me
It doesn't mean you have to be afraid of how
We're not the same, don't leave me now

But darling there you go, slipping away

How can I get you to stay where you are
Keep you for going too far
Holding you here is so hard to do...I'm losing you

And darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace
Drifting away into your sacred place
Someplace that I've never been
There you go, slipping away, slipping away, into a state of grace
There you go, slipping away into a state of grace
There you go...drifting away...
