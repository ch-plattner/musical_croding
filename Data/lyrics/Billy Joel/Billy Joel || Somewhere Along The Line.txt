
Well it's a rainy night in Paris
And I'm sitting by the Seine
It's a pleasure to be soaking
In the European rain
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine
But in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line

Sweet Virginia Cigarette
Burning in my hand
Well you used to be a friend of mine
But now I understand
You've been eating up inside me for some time
But I know your gonna get me
Somewhere along the line

Somewhere along the line
Well I know it's just a matter of time
When the fun falls through and the rent comes due
Somewhere along the line

Well, you know I love my woman
And I would not let her down
And I did my share of lovin'
When I used to get around
Now I'm satisfied that she is lookin' fine
But you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line

Hey, it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes, a young man is the king
Of every kingdom that he sees
There's an old and feeble man not far behind
But it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
