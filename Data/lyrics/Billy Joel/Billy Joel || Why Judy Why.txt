
Of all the people in the world that I know
You're the best place to go when I cry, when I cry
I never asked for much before, not before
Things are changed: I need more
Tell me why Judy why

I never thought that she would say, say goodbye
But she did, and now I want to die,
I want to die I never thought that
I would need, need a friend
Oh, but I did in the end
Tell me why Judy why
Oh what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where've you been?

'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day
A man my age is very young
So I'm told
Why do I feel so old?
Tell me why Judy why, Judy why

Oh what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where've you been?
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day
There's no tomorrow
'Cause my dream did not last
So I live in the past
Tell me why Judy why
Tell me why Judy why
Oh, tell me why Judy why
