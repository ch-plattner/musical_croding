
It's time for me to be on my way I know
I've got business to conduct
And I've got places to go
But I can't help looking at her sleeping instead
Another morning I'll have trouble climbing out of this bed
Because - she's such a temptation

It's driving me crazy
And it's my fascination
That's making me act this way
And I know what all my friends say
They're afraid that I'm losing my touch
But she's such a temptation

I look so tired cause I don't get much sleep
And I've got too many commitments that are too hard to keep
And I try to be rational
And I try to be wise
But it all gets blown to pieces
When I look in her eyes
Because - She's such a temptation
And nothing can save me

And my only salvation
Is tearing myself away
And I know what all of my friends say
There's a danger in wanting too much
But she's such a temptation

I should be leaving
But I can't cut loose
I have my reasons for resistance
But I have no excuse
And I lose my composure
I could use some restraint
I never claimed to be a hero
And I never said I was a saint
She's such a temptation
It's driving me crazy
And it's my fascination
That's making me act this way
And I can just hear all my friends say
"Better watch out, you're losing your touch"
But she's such a temptation

Yes she is
She's such a temptation
Yes she is
Yes she is
She's such a temptation
