
Well so, here I am at the end of the road
Where do I go from here?
I always figured it would be like this
Still nothin' seems to be quite clear

All the words have been spoken
And the prophecy fulfilled
But I just can't decide where to go
Yes, it's been quite a day
And I should go to sleep
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know
That I've got to begin again
Though I don't know how to start
Yes, I've got to begin again, and it's hard

Well, it's been quite a while since I lifted my head
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes
I see the way that I've been spendin' my days
And reality has caught me by surprise
I was dreamin' of tomorrow
So I sacrificed today
And it sure was a grand waste of time
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I've got to begin again
Though I don't know how to start
Yes, I've got to begin again, and it's hard
Yes, it's hard, oh, ooh, ooh
