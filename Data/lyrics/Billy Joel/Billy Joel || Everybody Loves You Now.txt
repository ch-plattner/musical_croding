Baby all the lights are turned on you
Now you're in the center of the stage
Ev'rything revolves on what you do
Ah, you are in your prime
You've come of age
You can always have your way somehow
'Cause ev'rybody loves you now

You can walk away from your mistakes
You can turn your back on what you do
Just a little smile is all it takes
And you can have your cake and eat it too
Loneliness will get to you somehow
But ev'rybody loves you now

Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply
Ah, but between you and me and the
Staten Island ferry So do I

All the people want to know your name
Soon there will be lines outside your door
Feelings do not matter in your game
'Cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore
So your life is only living anyhow
And ev'rybody loves you now

Close your eyes when you don't want to see
And stay at home when you don't want to go
Only speak to those who will agree
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know
You have lost your innocence somehow
But ev'rybody loves you now

Ah. you know that nothin' lasts forever
And it's all been done before
Ah but you ain't got the time
To go to Cold Spring Harbor no more

See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them all crawl
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall
This is what you wanted, ain't you proud
'Cause ev'rybody loves you now
