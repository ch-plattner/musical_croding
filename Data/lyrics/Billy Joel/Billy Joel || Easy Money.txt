You don't have to talk all night
I'm a man who can't say no
You don't have to twist my arm
Just point me where you want me to go
Take me to the action
Take me to the track
Take me to a party if they're bettin' in the back
I've been working all my life
Can't afford to wait
Let me call my wife so I can tell her I'll be late

I want easy money
Easy money
Easy money
I could get lucky
Oh, things could go right

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
Maybe this one time
Maybe tonight

You don't have to try too hard
I don't need a song and dance
I don't need an invitation
If you've got a game of chance
Take me to the tables
Take me to the fights
Run me like the numbers
Roll me like the dice

When you're counting on a killing
Always count me in
Talk to me into losin' just as long as I can win

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
I want the good times
Oh, I never had
I want the easy
Easy money
I want the good life
I want it bad

Easy money
You say I fool myself
But better me than someone else
I got a hot slot machine of a system
Ready to go
Easy money
I got a one track mind
And a good reputation laying on the line
I'll either come back a bum or a king
Baby, I don't know

You don't have to start a fight
I'm a man who can't say no
If you've got a little risky business
Just point me where you want to go
Take me to the power
Take me to the heat
Take me to the cleaners
If it's open to the street
Something's got to pay off
Something's got to break
Someone's got a fortune that they're begging
Me to take

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
I could get lucky
Things could go right
I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
Maybe just this time
Oh maybe tonight
Easy money
Oh I don't want no hard cash
I just want the easy money
I could get lucky
