
Oh, sweet lady
Runnin' like a stream
You don't look back
Because you know hands are clean

You make believe
That the past was just a dream
You make believe the past was just a dream

Turn around
Turn around
And I will sing for you a song
I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long

Oh, Eliza, you must beget again
And all the roads that you have walked are
comin' to an end
I was your lover but I thought
I was your friend I loved you but
I thought I was your friend

So, turn around
Oh, turn around
And I will sing for you a song
I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long

Oh, sweet lady stand beside the sea
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard
to be? Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be

So, turn around
Oh, turn around
Yeah, and I will sing for you a song
And I don't know where you been
But you been gone too long

Too long
I said, you been gone too long
You been gone too long
