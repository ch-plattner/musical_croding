
Roberta, you say you know me,
But I see only what you're paid to show me.
Oh, I wish you had the time,
Oh, I wish you had the time.

Oh, Roberta, I understand you,
I know you need to move in other circles too;
It's tough for me, It's tough for you.

Roberta, how I've adored you,
I'd ask you over but I can't afford you.
Oh, I wish you'd take the time,
Oh, I wish you'd take the time.

Oh, Roberta, the night goes slowly,
I know you're workin' but you must get lonely too;
It's tough for me, It's tough for you.

And I'm in a bad way and wanna make love to you, Oo, oo.

Oh, I wish you had the time,
Oh, I wish you had the time.

Roberta, I really need you,
But I suppose that my small change won't see you through;
It's tough for me, It's tough for you.
