
Turn on all the Christmas lights
Cause baby's coming home tonight
I can hear her footsteps in the street

Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire
That should make the atmosphere complete

I've had to wait forever
But better late than never
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time

I'm a man with so much tension
Far too many sins to mention
She don't have to take it anymore

But since she said she's coming home
I've torn out all my telephones
Soon she will be walking through that door

I may be going nowhere
But I don't mind if she's there
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time

Left to my own device
I can always make believe
That there's nothing wrong

Still I will choose to live
In the complicated world
That we share for so long
Good or bad
Right or wrong
And it occurred to me
While I set up my Christmas tree
She never missed a cue
Or lost a beat

Everytime I lost the meter
There she was when I would need her
Greeting me with footsteps in the street

I guess I should have known it
She'd find the perfect moment
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time

Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire
That will make the atmosphere complete

I've had to wait forever
But better late than never
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
She's right on time
She's right on time
