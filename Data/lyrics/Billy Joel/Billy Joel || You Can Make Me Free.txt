
You can make me free
You can make me smile
You can make me be like a little child
You can melt the ice that chills my body
You can dry my ev'ry tear
You can make the lonely hours disappear

You can make me free
You can make me rise
You can make me see
So open up my eyes
Don't you know my only real momerrts are the
ones I spend with you?
How I long to drink some wine again with you?
I can take the skies
I can soar like a bird
With his heart full of song, yeah, yeah
Won't you color my eyes?
I've been writing so long

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better if you only try
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you. my love
I will wait when you'll be what I'm dreaming of
I can take the skies
I can soar like a bird
With his heart full of song, yeah, yeah
Won't you color my eyes?
I've been writing so long

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better if you only try
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime

Until I am with you, my love
I will wait when you'll be what I'm dreaming of
You can make me free
You can make me cry
I know you know that you can make it
so much better If you would only try, yeah. yeah. yeah
