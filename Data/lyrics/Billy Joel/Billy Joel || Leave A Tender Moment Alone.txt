
Even though I'm in love
Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong
Just to have something to say

I know the moment isn't right
To tell the girl a comical line
To keep the conversation light
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind
But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've ever known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
Cause I'm just avoiding the facts

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment alone
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide
And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've ever known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone
You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment alone
Leave it alone
You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment alone
