With my eyes open wide I can see
Ah, you feel so good to me
And it's so good when you're here
'Cause I'm free
I'm feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face
You lifted me high above my ordinary place, uh huh
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace, yeah yeah Woh, woh

Ah, you look so good to me
With my eyes open wide I can see
Ah, you feel so good to me
And who knows what your next move will be

Ah, you look so good to me
With my eyes open wide I can see
Ah, you feel so good to me
And it's so good when you're here, 'cause I'm free
