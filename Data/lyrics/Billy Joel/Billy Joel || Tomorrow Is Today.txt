I've been livin' for the moment
But I just can't have my way
And I'm afraid to go to sleep
'Cause tomorrow is today

People tell me life is sweeter
But I don't hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today

I don't care to know the hour
'Cause it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
'Cause I saw it yesterday

So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And what's the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today, oh

Still I'm waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you don't need the love
I'm giving
So tomorrow is today

Oh my, I'm goin' to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Make my bed, I'm gonna lie in it
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it
Too late. too much givin'

I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way
And someday if your dreams are leavin' you
I'll still believe in you

Though I'm living and I'm singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over 'cause
Tomorrow is today
