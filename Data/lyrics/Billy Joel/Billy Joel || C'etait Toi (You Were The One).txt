
Here I am again
In this smoky place
With my brandy eyes
I'm talking to myself
You were the one
You were the one

Here I go again
Looking for your face
And I realize
That I should look for someone else
But you were the one
You were the one

I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after all
I know there is no one
That can save me from myself
You were the only one

Me revoici
Dans ce bar enfume
Avec mes yeux iures
Je me parle a moi meme
C'etait toi
C'etait toi

Me revoici
Cherchant ton visage
Et je realise
Que je devrais en chercher une autre
C'etait toi
You were the one

Je recherche l'affection
Qu'une autre pourrait me donner
Mais apres tout
Je sais qu'il n'y a personne
Personne qui puisse me sauver
Tu etais la seule

I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after all
I know there is no one
That can save me, save me from myself
You were the only one
