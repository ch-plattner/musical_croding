
He always found it hard to take her
She wouldn't listen to advice
And though he never tried to make her
She often thought it would be nice

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
It's been a long time comin'
But she's feelin' like a woman tonight
And she left a little letter,
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye.  Goodbye.

She tried for years to be a good wife
It never quite got off the ground
And all those stories of the good life
Convinced her not to hang around

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
And she doesn't know what's comin'
But she sure knows what she's leavin' behind
And she left a little letter,
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada.
Goodbye.  Goodbye.

And though she finds it hard to leave him
She knows it would be worse to stay
He wouldn't understand the reasons
That make a woman run away

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
With some money in her pocket,
She's a rocket on the Fourth of July
And she left a little letter,
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada.
Goodbye.  Goodbye.
