
Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
To live in sunshine
Their funky exile
Midwestern ladies
High-heeled and faded
Drivin' sleek new sports cars
With their New York cowboys

Hiding up in the mountains
Laying low in the canyons
Goin' nowhere on the streets
With the Spanish names
Makin' love with the natives
In their Hollywood places
Making up for all the time gone by

Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
Cuz it's all so easy
To become acquainted
Electric babies
Blue-jeaned and jaded
Such hot sweet schoolgirls
So educated

Tanning out in the beaches
With their Mexican reefers
No one ever has to feel
Like a refugee
Going into garages
For exotic massages
Making up for all the time gone by
Hiding up in the mountains
Laying low in the canyons
Goin' nowhere on the streets
With the Spanish names
Makin' love with the natives
In their Hollywood places
Making up for all the time gone by

Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
It's so familiar
Their foreign faces
