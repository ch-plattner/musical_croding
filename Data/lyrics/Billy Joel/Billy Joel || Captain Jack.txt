
Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
You're tired of livin' in your one-horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while

So you go to the village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Your sister's gone out. She's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon but you just can't wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Ahh, but still your finger's gonna pick your nose
After all

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
Oh yeah...

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for?

So you got everything, aw but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore.

But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Aw Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
Ooh yeah...

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong?

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Well now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Oh Captain Jack will get you high tonight
Take you to your special island
Well now Captain Jack will make you high tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Yeah Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will make you high tonight
Well now Captain Jack will make you high tonight
