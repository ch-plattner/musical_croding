
Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams 
Since I Met Her From The Start 
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One 
Who Is Special In Her Heart 

The Girl Is Mine 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 
I Know She's Mine 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 

I Don't Understand The Way You Think 
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine 
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams 
Really Just A Waste Of Time 

Because Shes Mine 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 
Don't Waste Your Time 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 

I Love You More Than He 
(Take You Anywhere) 

But I Love You Endlessly 
(Loving We Will Share) 

So Come And Go With Me 
To One Town 
But We Both Cannot Have Her 
So It's One Or The Other 

Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down 
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time 
That She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her 
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind 

The Girl Is Mine 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 
Don't Waste Your Time 
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) 
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine 
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) 

[Will.I.Am]
She Love The Way I Love Her Low 
The Way I Love Her High 
(Love Her High) 
She Love To Say Hello 
And Never Say Goodbye 
(Say Good Bye) 

I Call Her Mommy 
And She Call Me Papa 
I'm Sorry Mike But 
She Love The Way I Rock Her 

And You Know, You Know, You Know I Really Care 
(You Know, You Know, You Know I Care) 
And She Know, She Know The Love Is Right Here 
And I Know, I Know The Love Is Real True 
And Now They Know, They Know Just How The Willie Do 

They Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock 

The Way I Roll With It 
The Way I Rock With It 
The Way I Rock With King Of Pop None Stop With It 

The Way I Rock The Way 
The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, I Rock, I Rock 

Will.I.Am None Stop 
Rollin With The King Of Pop 
MJ Make It Hot 
Yeah, You Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock
