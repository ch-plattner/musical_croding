[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There's Something
I Have To Say To You
If You Promise You'll
Understand
I Cannot Contain Myself
When In Your Presence
I'm So Humble
Touch Me
Don't Hide Our Love
Woman To Man

[Michael]
She's Just A Lover
Who's Doin' Me By
It's Worth The Giving
It's Worth The Try
You Cannot Cleave It
Or Put It In The Furnace
You Cannot Wet It
You Cannot Burn It

She Wants To Give It
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
Dare Me
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
She Wants To Give It
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)

It's Just A Feeling
You Have To Soothe It
You Can't Neglect It
You Can't Abuse It
It's Just Desire
You Cannot Waste It
Then, If You Want It
Then, Won't You Taste It

She Wants To Give It
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
Dare Me
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
She Wants To Give It
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
(She Wants To Give It)
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)

One Thing In Life
You Must Understand
The Truth Of Lust
Woman To Man
So Open The Door
And You Will See
There Are No Secrets
Make Your Move
Set Me Free

[Michael]
Because There's Something
About You Baby
That Makes Me Want
To Give It To You
I Swear There's Something
About You Baby

Just Promise Me
Whatever We Say
Or Whatever We Do
To Each Other
For Now We'll Make A Vow
To Just 
Keep It In The Closet

If You Can Get It
It's Worth A Try
I Really Want It
I Can't Deny
It's Just Desire
I Really Love It
[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
'Cause If It's Aching
You Have To Rub It

(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
She Wants To Give It

[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just Open The Door
And You Will See
This Passion Burns
Inside Of Me
Don't Say To Me
You'll Never Tell
Touch Me There
Make The Move
Cast The Spell
