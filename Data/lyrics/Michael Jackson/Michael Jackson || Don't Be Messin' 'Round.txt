Are you ready for a real good time
Are you ready for a real good treat
There'll be so much dancing, singing
I let you fall into me

[Chorus:]
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey

If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
I’ll be so proud if you let me love ya girl
Let me love ya for a little while

[Chorus:]
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey
Oho yeah yeah,
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah

Now she started finger popping to the beat
So I said lets get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No no don't mess around with me
I ain't playing

[Chorus:]
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey

[Chorus x2]
