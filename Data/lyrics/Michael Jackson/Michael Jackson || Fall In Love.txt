
Tear me apart, break my heart
Let me in this wonderland with you
Short desire warms my heart
I loved you from the moment of your sigh

She said she wanna fall in love
She said she wanna give it up, oh
She said she wanna turn my life all around
She said she wanna play the game
I love it when you say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

I wanna fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Let me fall with you)
Girl, let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Just let me fall with you)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you

Now I'm here with you
The sun comes through 
The moon is watching us, me and you 
The sun is going down (the rain comes down) 
The rain is coming down
And the wind is blowing us and it's you

She said she wanna fall in love (She says)
She said she wanna give it up
She said she wanna turn my life all around

I wanna fall, let me fall, let me fall with you (Do you wanna fall?)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Ooh, don't you wanna fall with me)
Girl, let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you (Ooh, just let me fall)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you
(Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you)

Stay with me, you're making me say
Stay with me, I'm making my way
Inside the world, inside the world
My life, you're my life
You're my world, yea girl
I will always be with you tonight

Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you
(Happily fell, happily fell)
(Oooh, loving you)
(You're beautiful, wonderful, I love you so)
(You're beautiful)
(I love you so, I love you so)
(Oh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you
Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you
