Heard he grew up in Queens
Got a bullets to the brain
Dug a step into fame
But that don't mean a thing
Said he rather be king
But with an absolute reign
'Till he finds himself a victim of the game

(He was stabbing her back, as a matter of fact)
Then his life became serious, 

Marchin’ like the soldier, 
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchin’ like the soldier,
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again

People say that you’re blind,
Then they say that you’re fine, 
But they won’t help you find, find the road again 
If they won’t help you fight
So they torture your mind
Then leave you delirious
Oh my

Marchin’ like the soldier, 
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchin’ like the soldier,
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again

No, no
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee hee hee
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee hee hee

Marchin’ like the soldier, 
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchin’ like the soldier,
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again

Marchin’ like the soldier, 
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchin’ like the soldier,
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, 
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again
