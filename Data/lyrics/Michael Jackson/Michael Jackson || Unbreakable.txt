
Now I'm just wondering why you think 
that you can get to me with anything 
seems like you'd know by now 
When and how I get down 
And with all that I've been through, 
I'm still around 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
Baby I've got what it takes 
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it 
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable 
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it 
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 

Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
that if you block me, you've done your thing 
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
IÂ´m steady laughin', while surfacing 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
baby I've got what it takes 
and there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS 2x]

You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing 
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
Through all your lies and silly games 
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable 

[RAP]

[CHORUS 3x]
