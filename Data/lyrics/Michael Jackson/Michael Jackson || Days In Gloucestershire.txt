I can’t get it back, my youth is gone
We really had it all, oh

Hold my like you really used to
Summers in Gloucestershire
The air has changed
The city won’t light in an about you
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again

Ahh, ohh, mmm
