
I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way that things could have been
She said that I don't care
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy had turned to pain

Father always told me,
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't you feel no pain? (No way!)

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain!
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain!

I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine.”
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move!

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain!
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain!

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)
Father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling this way boy!

I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,
Is that boy still alive? (uh)
The week in village...what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me,
You won't live a quiet life,
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)
Then stand here in my shoes
And then think of my blues!

It’s the price of fame!
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feeling this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling no pain boy!
