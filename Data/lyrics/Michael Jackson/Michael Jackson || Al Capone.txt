After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And it told her out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Oh!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And a man is out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her (should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (oh, ba-da)
No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Oh!

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied under his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?
