He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus:]
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 

[Chorus]

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
They started going steady and bless my soul 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus]
