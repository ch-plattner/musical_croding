
You came to me and shown me
That love is the answer
I will save you, protect you from everything
We should live in togetherness with one another

People all over the world
When you start to lend a helping hand
You can make it a better place
This song is for you
To bring love and harmony to this world

I can hear people crying
My heart weeps when I see your tears
I will give my shoulder whenever you need
So let us sing together

People all over the world
Your smile makes me smile
You can make our future brighter
Let the world shine with happy smiles

People all over the world
When you start to lend a helping hand
You can make it a better place
This song is for you
To bring love and harmony to this world

People all over the world
Your smile makes me smile
You can make our future brighter
Let the world shine with happy smiles

"Together we sing to make a better world"
