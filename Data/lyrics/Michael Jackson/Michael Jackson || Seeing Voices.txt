
I sing of what you see and might think about 
Because of what you see.
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the ear
Not the eye traces what's on the mind

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends.
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone.

So..

When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices.

Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices. 
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

So think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices

Voices, voice
