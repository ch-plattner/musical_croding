He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he say
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

See, don't you do it baby
I said yeah
Don't you let go baby
See, you
Don't you do it

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't you let go baby
Don't you, don't you let go
I said yeah
Can I get how it feels baby
Don't you let go baby
Yeah
Oh
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand.

[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!
