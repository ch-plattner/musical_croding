
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know me so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

Maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
And when I say, I love you
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in this cold night air
For this good love i'm receiving
I'll go anywhere, just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)

The sun in me
All these words that young lovers say

And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun refuse to shine
And when I say, I need you
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Baby, you never know
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)

Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know
(That's for all time, that's for all time, that's for all time)

See that you'll never go
(That's for all time)
Baby, you never know
(That's for all time)
