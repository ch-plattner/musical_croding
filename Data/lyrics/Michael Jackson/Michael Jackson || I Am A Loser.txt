
You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
I say "Hello", you say "Good-bye"
I reach to you, you don't even try
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it make me cry
Losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die

I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand, I'm losing you
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
(I am a loser) Alright
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it make me cry
Losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die (Ever die)

I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you, now you don't even try
(I am a loser) Alright
(I am a loser)
What kind of foolish guy am I
You break my heart, I wonder why
(I am a loser) Alright
(I am a loser)

(I am a loser, I am a loser)
Baby, alright
Baby, alright
Alright, alright
One time, alright
Let me win one time, alright
I gotta win, I gotta win, I can't lose
Don't talk about this one time, please
On my begging knees, on my begging knees
Ooo ooo, alright, hee hee
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, uh
I am a loser, I am a loser
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser 
Let me win one time, let me win one time
Alright, hee

(I am a loser)
Good-bye to you, good-bye to thee
Good-bye to you, hello world
Maybe tomorrow, maybe today
Who knows who will win
