
Stone shaker, your here tonight,
You've gotta, you love maker,
Girl it's alright, 
You can't remember when you smiled,
You know it's gonna take some time,

Heart-walker, I'm here to touch,
You've gotta, Night-stalker,
Love you so much,
You feel you need a hand to hold,
Then maybe you and I, 
Can make it on our own

Bring out some Slapstick (turnin' me on)
Bring out some magic (your number one)
Bring out some Slapstick (makin' me high)
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile, 
(Darlin', yeah)

That heart-breaker, has gone away,
So baby, you don't fake it, 
Let your heart play,
There's more than love, that we can make,
Your holdin' it behind your eye, (yeah, yeah)
Some feeling, you can't explain,
It's such a, a hard feeling,
lying in bed's flame,
It's spinnin' round and round again,
And baby you and I, 
can make it on our own

Give me some Slapstick (turnin' me on)
Bring out the magic (your number one)
I want some Slapstick (makin' me high)
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,
(Everytime, He He, He He)

Oh,

(No more cryin')
Reach out and bring a little love
In your life, girl
(Keep on tryin')
You gotta keep on tryin' baby
Holdin' on to love, tonight

[Guitar Solo]

(Oh no)
Stone-shaker, your far to much,
You've gotta, you love maker,
Girl it's alright,
Your spinin' round and round again,
So baby let it shine,
And everything's alright,

Because of Slapstick (turnin' me on)
I want some magic (your number one)
I want some Slapstick, girl (makin' me high)
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,

Because of Slapstick (turnin' me on)
I want some magic (your number one)
I want some Slapstick (makin' me high)
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,

Bring out the Slapstick, (turnin' me on)
I want some magic, girl (your number one)
I want some Slapstick, girl (makin' me high)
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,
(Ohhh)
