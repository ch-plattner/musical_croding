Well lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what's goin' down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
I don't even wanna say it
Cause of all the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business goin' down

Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
Don't be callin' down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even burst the breast
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
Don't be goin' down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down

I read the paper
And I can't believe what's goin' round
Somebody's doin' it to
Somebody's up, somebody's down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
You're dirty
You're dirty
Dirty, dirty baby

Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Your brother didn't make a nickel
Or dime too
Sittin' round tellin' how he did it to you

Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down
Goin' down babe
Monkey business goin' down
I'm not satisfied baby
Monkey business goin' down
You wanna party
Monkey business goin' down
My business, is your business
Monkey business goin' down
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Monkey business goin' down
Monkey see, monkey do
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Your business, is my business
Monkey business goin' down
Your business, is my business
Monkey business goin' down
