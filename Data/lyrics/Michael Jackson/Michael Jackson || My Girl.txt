I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way? 
My girl
(My girl, my girl) 
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl) 

I've got so much honey
the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than
the birds in the trees
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way? 
My girl
(My girl, my girl) 
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl) 

Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey
Ooooh... 

I don't need no money, 
fortune or fame
I've got all the riches baby
one man can claim
Well I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way? 
My girl
(My girl, my girl) 
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
