Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

If you look around
The whole world is comin' together now, baby
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice

Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother
When hate won't do, ooh
'Cause we're all the same, yes
The blood inside of me is inside of you

Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah, yeah, oh

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
(Another place, another place, another place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
(Another child, another child)

But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now?
So brothers and sisters show me know how

Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah yeah oh

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

All the children in the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice

Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers
When death won't do, ooh
Yes, we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you

Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
