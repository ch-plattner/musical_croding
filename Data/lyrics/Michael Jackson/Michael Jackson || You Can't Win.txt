And you can't get out of the game
People keep sayin' things are gonna change
But they look us like, you're stayin' the same

You can't win, get over your head
And you only have yourself to blame
You can't win Chile
(You can't win Chile)
You ain't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, the world keeps movin'
And you're standin' far behind
People keep sayin', things'll get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back, and you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

So you can't win, Chile, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't win no way
If your story stays the same, no, no
(You ain't winnin')
(But it's nice to see you)
(I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it 'cause it ain't about losing')

Then the world has got no shame
You can't win, Chile
You can't break even
You can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't break even
Ain't the way it's supposed to be, no, no
(You'll be spendin')
(Your little bit of money)

While someone else rides for free, ooh
(Learn your lesson)
(Refuel your mind)
(Before someone blows out your flame)

You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win

You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win

You can't win, Chile, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game, no, no
