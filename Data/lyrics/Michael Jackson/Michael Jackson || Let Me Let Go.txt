
Yea yea yea!
Oooh girl.
I remember you callin, sayin
That things were through with us.
I have a hard time feelin within.
Just started moving on.
Got back my feeling chilling.
Started chilling getting back with it.

Now I seem to be every where lately
Too much to be coincidentally
Why you wanna lead me on,
I’m not the one you want
So girl don’t keep me hangin
You won’t let me let go
Got me thinking it’s on
Girl you know that you’re wrong
You won’t, you won’t let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye don’t mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You won’t! You won’t let me let go

Oooh yea
When we started datin’ makin
Moves on the single scene
Never seen you so jealous
Tellin all the other girls that you’re still with me
You may think its funny hunnie
I ain’t laughin
You know what I think about it

Now I seem to be every where lately
To much to be coincidentally,
Why you wanna lead me on,
I’m not the one you want
So girl don’t keep me hangin
You won’t let me let go
Got me thinking it’s on
Girl you know that you’re wrong
You wont, you won’t let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye don’t mean hello
Love you leave me alone
You won’t! You won’t let me let go
You won’t let me let go,
You won’t let me let go,
You won’t let me let go

You won’t let me let go
Got me thinking it’s on
Girl you know that you’re wrong
You wont, you won’t let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye don’t mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You won’t! You won’t let me let go

You won’t let me let go
Got me thinking it’s on
Girl you know that you’re wrong
You wont, you won’t let me let go
