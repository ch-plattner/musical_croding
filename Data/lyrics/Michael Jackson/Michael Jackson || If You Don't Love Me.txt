I saw a picture of you and me
Lovin' me deep
I had to write you just to tell you that
And to find out if you really love missin' me 'cos
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't need me
Just like I need you
If you don't love me
If I don't love you

And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do baby?
'Cos I'm in love with you

I told the doctor that I got a broken heart
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?
Tell me what I wanna hear
Like your missin' me 'cos
if you don't love me
if you don't love me
If you don't need me
If you don't need me
If you don't want me
The way I want you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do baby?
'Cos I'm in love with you
You!

Oh, baby, baby, I've been missing you
For such a long, long time ago
You changed your number and I couldn't call you
So I couldn't tell you so
I had to write you just to tell you that
I may be kissing on your photograph

If you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
Baby baby, baby
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't want me
I you don't love me
Give it to me
If you don't love me

Baby, baby, baby
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
And I don't love you
If you don't love me
If you don't need me
If you don't love me
Give it to me
Give it
If you don't love me
Give it to me, baby
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
Love me
If you don't love me
I really wanna have it
If you don't love me
I'm beggin' my bed
Oooh, ooh

I know what I'm gonna do
All I know it is...
Baby, baby, baby, baby

If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't want me
If you don't love me
And if you don't need me
If you don't love me
I'm beggin' my bed
If you don't love me
I'm beggin' my bed
If you don't love me
Give it to me, baby
If you don't love me
And if you don't want me
If you don't love me
If you don't need me
If you don't love me
Give it to me, baby
If you don't love me
If you don't want me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
Aow!
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
