
Read you from a mile away
Just thinkin' easy to adore
A taste of me
Let the fountain pour
Girl, I mean like stand and see
Ooh I wanna taste your skin
Ooh I wanna, girl I gotta wonder
If we can drown again

If you can touch me again
Say we will dance
Light fire to my skin
We burn again

Girl I wanna touch the fire
Ooh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Girl come on and let me light the fire,
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me burn tonight

I can’t believe I see you ahead right now
Feel the fire
We’re burning like Hell came tonight
My soul deciders

I can’t nobody stop the thing we got
It makes you wonder
A friend of mine? Sexy wine?
Baby why you play me like a toy?

When you say, take me again
When that we dance
We passionately stop to burn again

Girl I wanna touch the fire
Ooh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Girl come on and let me light the fire,
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me burn tonight

Burn Tonight!

(Ooh come on and let me light the fire)

(Baby come on and let me burn tonight)

Girl I wanna touch the fire
Ooh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me light the fire

You can let me touch the fire
Girl come on and let me light the fire,
And you can make me burn tonight,
Baby come on and let me burn tonight

Girl I wanna touch the fire

You can let me touch the fire
