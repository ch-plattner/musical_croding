
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs 
she only knows how low that she can go 
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
only for me, then spoke with her body 
her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I canÂ´t tell her no 

[CHORUS]
That girl I can't take her 
should have known she was a heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right thriough her 
she's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 

[CHORUS 2x]

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
Stop being without you 
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
and start being without you 
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
and stop talkin' aboout you 
and what will she say? 
She will say I was the man that got away 

[RAP ]
