Hoo!

Aaow!

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
And nothing gonna stop
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

Because

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

Aaow!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)

(Speed demon)

Go!
Aaow!

Hoo!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
