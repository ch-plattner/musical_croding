You know I can't get away from you girl
(You've got me shakin')
I need all of the things you do girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby
Get up, and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And lady let me set you free

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl if we try 
We can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Now girl
Hee!
Hoo!

I go heart beating just for you girl
(You've got me shakin')
I've tried all but I can't get you girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby
Get up, and rock it to the rhythm
(Rock it baby)
Put out your heart to me
And lady let me set you free

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl if we try 
We can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Tonight girl

Baby the love that is waiting inside you baby
Show me the passion and feel when I'm by your side
This is the time to discover the dream we make girl
Girl can you feel it
Time of your life

Don't you know
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl if we try 
We can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl if we try 
We can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
