
You can look at them coming out the walls
You can look at them climbing out the bushes
You can find them when the letter’s bout to fall
He be waiting with his camera right on focus

Everywhere you seem to turn
there’s a monster
When you look up in the air there’s a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster
(Too bad)

Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
(Too bad)
It’s got you bouncing off the wall
It’s got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
And tell me you like
Don’t you, don’t you like it

Monster
He’s a monster
He’s an animal

Monster (yea-eah)
He’s a monster
He’s an animal

He’s coming at ya
Coming at ya rather too fast
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
And you’re running
And you’re running just to escape it
But they are gunning for the money
So they fake it

Everywhere you seem to turn
there’s a monster
When you look up in the air there’s a monster
When you see them in the street
that’s a monster, monster, monster
(Too bad)

Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
It’s got you bouncing off the wall
It’s got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
And tell me you like what you see

Monster
(he’s like an animal)
He’s a monster
(just like an animal)
He’s an animal
(and he’s moving in the air)
Monster
He’s a monster
He’s an animal
(everybody wanna be a star)

Why are they never satisfied with all you give, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah
You give them your all
They’re watching you fall
And they eat your soul like a vegetable

[50 Cent]
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin’ you’ll take a whippin’
animal, hannibal, cannibal addition
tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin’
shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it
funeral’s, cemetaries, don’t worry it’s time to visit
broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I’m kidding
its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
all hell, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there’s nothing iller, it’s killer
there vision, the missin’ the pack, this is that,
this the bomb, ring the alarm
MJ number 1, it’s goes on and on
its goes on and on
we get to crippin’, its running in the early morn’
keep on dreaming there’s nowhere to run
you can drive but you done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come.

[Michael Jackson]
Too bad, oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
It’s got you bouncing off the wall
It’s got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just making it clearer
And tell me you like
Don’t you don’t you like it

Monster
(she wanna be a star)
He’s a monster
(say you wanna go far)
He’s an animal
(Why do you keep stalking me)
Monster
(what you do to me)
He’s a monster
(why did you take, why did you fake it)
He’s an animal
(yee-aah, why are stalking me)

Monster
(why are you haunting me)
He’s a monster
(why are you stalking me)
He’s an animal
(why did you do it, why did you, why are you stalking me)

Monster
(why are you haunting me)
He’s a monster
(why are you haunting me)
He’s an animal
(Why did you, why did you)

He’s dragging you down like a monster
he’s keeping you down like a monster

He’s dragging you down like a monster
He’s keeping you down like a monster
