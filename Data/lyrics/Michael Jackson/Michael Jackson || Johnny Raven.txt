
Free and untamed that's how I've grown
(It's Johnny Raven)
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
(It's Johnny Raven)
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild

Refrain
I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
by and by (By and By)
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
(It's Johnny Raven)
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
(It's Johnny Raven)
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

Refrain
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
(It's Johnny Raven)
by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven 
(It's Johnny Raven)
yeah, yeah by abd by
(It's Johnny Raven)
I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die
