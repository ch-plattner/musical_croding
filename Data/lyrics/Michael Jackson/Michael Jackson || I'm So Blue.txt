
There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And after be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And after we all did?

She told me she forgiving me
A lifetime Love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing to keep from feelin’ blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

Here I am so all alone
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t explain, I’m all alone
You used to love me
I feel I’m your blue

They told me you should sing a song
Of happy with your feelin’ blue
I’m singing for so very long
Still crying, tell me what should I do.

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

She told me she forgiving me
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing crying helplessly
But I’m keep singing

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

(Wooh)

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada daa (That’s why I want to be free)
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh, Wooh, Wooh)
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh I, Oh)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please
(Set me free)

(Wooh) (Wooh)
