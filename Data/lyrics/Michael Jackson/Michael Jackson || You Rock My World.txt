My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk

I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my
life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I
finally found, come on, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently

Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all
my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa...oh...oh...)
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come
on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

Girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to
me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,

And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my
world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
