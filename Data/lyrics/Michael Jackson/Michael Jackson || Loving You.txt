You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the hightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Loving you, that's what I want to do
