
My pocket were full and now my money's gone
My friends come around and now they're gone
Things come and they come and then they go
And where they go nobody knows

[Refrain]
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around

My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace
Yet people push bullshit in my face
The future can't hold what your money can't buy
My brother keep striving your child relies

[Refrain]
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around

The world keep on spinning does the future know? 
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow
We've ruined what's pure down from nature below? 
You'd better look back it'll all be gone

[Refrain]
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around

So children please listen this world is yours
This message to deep to ignore
Your forefathers said but they did not do
The things that would show that they cared for you

[Refrain]
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around yeah

Gonna take you higher
I'm gonna take you higher
I'm gonna take you higher
Yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna take you higher
Gonna take you higher
Yeah yeah yeah

Gonna take you higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Gonna take you higher
Gonna take you higher
