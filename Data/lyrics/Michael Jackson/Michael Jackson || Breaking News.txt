
Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
Just when you thought he was done
He comes to give it again
They could print it around the world today
He wanna write my obituary

No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

[Chorus:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
This is breaking news
This is breaking news

Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon
You turned your back on a love and you can’t get it again.

No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

[Chorus x2:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
This is breaking news
This is breaking news

All the news today, they say we're crazy (celebrity)
And on the screen today, we're on display (baby)

[Chorus x2:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
This is breaking news
This is breaking news

You're breaking the news!
