
I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Ooooooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooooooh 

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooooooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
Ooooooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya
Ooooooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooooooh

I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me

The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
Ooooooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
You see
Ooooooh [x10]
