Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table he says "What's going on"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wants to be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body, ha girl that will take her far
The police come round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
