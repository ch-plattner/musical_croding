Girl, There's a better way
I'm talkin' bout me and you
You sittin' round with a long face
Thinkin' up nothing to do

And girl, there's a better way
I'm talkin' bout doin' the do
Your killin' time there's a better way
Than sittin' round being blue

Don't you know that there are better things to do?

Work that body
Work that body
All that body
Work that body
Work that body 
Everybody (give it to me)
Work that body
Work that body
All that body (give it to me)
Work that body
Oooohhhh

Time, to get to know me
Knowin' that nothing to do
Your walkin' in line at your wrong pace
Someone put a spell on you

You know, I don't wanna
I only wanna be with you
But two times two, mean nothin' to you
Cause you ain't got nothin' to lose

Don't you know that there are better things to do?

Work that body
Work that body
All that body (give it to me)
Work that body 
Work that body 
Everybody (give it to me)
Work that body
Work that body
All that body (work it to me)
Work that body (everybody)
Everybody (give it to me)
Work that body
Work that body
All that body (work it to me)
Work that body
Work that body (work it to me)
Everybody (work it to me)

Sit down girl, I think I love ya
No,  get up girl, show me what you can do

Suspicious,
Condition,
Pretentious,
Admission,
Persuasion,
Invasion,

All the time, I see it goin' round, and comin' round
Everytime we gonna tell em ahh to (work that body)

Work that body 
Work that body
All that body (work it for me now)
Work that body
Work that body
Everybody (give it to me)
Work that body
Work that body
All that body
All that body
Work that body
Everybody
Work that body
Work that body
All that body (give it to me now)
Work that body
Work that body
Everybody (give it to me)
Work that body
Work that body
Work that body
Work that body
