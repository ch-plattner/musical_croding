[Pitbull:]
Love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide
With the world greatest
You gonna play this
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
Be the latest
Don't delay this
I'm on that
Roll it
Making a toast to the king
MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad
That's right

[Michael Jackson:]
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shameone
Shameone
Lay it on me
All right

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again, 
Who's bad

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
Shameone
Shameone, lay on me
The world is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long,
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't slap my face
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
Woo! Woo! Woo!
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again...)
Who's bad
Who's bad

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
Shameone
Shameone
Lay it on me

[Pitbull:]
P-I-T is B-A-D
Michael Jackson, R.I.P.
Catch a chicken with a P-Y-T
All off in Paris
Ooh, oui, oui
I've been around the world getting off the chain
And ain't nothing changed
Luchando
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
De santo no tengo nada
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo
Mamita, te tengo la came
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
I'm so at it
I speak a third language
Called that moon talk
In four years catch me with a billon
Doing that moonwalk

[Michael Jackson:]
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it - you know it - you know
You know - you know - shameone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
You know, you know, you know it - shameone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Woo!
Who's bad
Who's bad
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - you know
Woo!
You know I'm bad - you know it
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad
