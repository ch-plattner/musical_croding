
All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
it cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
and you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Cos when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
Your sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me? 
With You? 
I don't know 
Who do you love, babe? 
I don't want ya 
If you can't answer 
I know you 

(Heaven must be wary) 
Heaven must be wary 
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every Year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary) 
Heaven must be wary 
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom 
And when I come to you 
Your sitting in your room 
You sit around in the strangest place 
So take off the mask 
So I can see your face 

Who do you love?
Is it me? 
With you? 
I dont know 
Who do you love, babe? 
I don't want ya 
If you can't answer 
I know you 

Who do you love?
Is it me? 
With you? 
I don't know 
Who do you love?
I don't want ya 
If you can't answer 
I don't know 
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) 
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) 
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
