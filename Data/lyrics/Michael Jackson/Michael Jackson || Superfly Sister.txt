Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in stick it out

He wanna do something keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
He wanna shake it up shake it down
Doing it right
He wanna jump back half flap doing it right

He wanna lay you down
Turn it up
Kicking it loose
He wanna fly high nigh high

Float around

Moving round ha ha

He wanna do it up keep it high
Deep in the night
He wanna eye ball
