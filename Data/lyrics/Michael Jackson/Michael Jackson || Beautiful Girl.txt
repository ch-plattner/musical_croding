I'm in love with a beautiful girl 
It's almost like dancing and romancing 
In her arms 
It's just a part of it 
Can't you see that I'm in love 
(love) 
I'm in love 
(love) 
I'm in love 
(love) 
Da de de da de da da dum 
Da da da da da da da dum

Can't you see that I'm in love

I'm in love with a beautiful girl 
I'm in love with a beautiful girl 
It's almost like dancing and romancing 
In her arms 
It's just a part of it 
Can't you see that I'm in love 
(love) 
I'm in love 
(love) 
I'm in love

Da da da da da la da dum 
She'll never know la da da dum 
Can't you see that I'm in love
