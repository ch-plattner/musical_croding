
In the town of Tulsa, 'bout thirty years ago
At King's Ol' Calloway, down in Old Oklahom'
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night

For The Light Crust Dough Boys and Doug Lee O'Dan
We drove eighty miles through the blowin' sand
My thirty-seven Chevy was shootin' steam
Coming up the hills, just East of Pawnee

But I wouldn't miss a dance on a Saturday night
For all of them Chevys in the Detroit Line
I can hear that music in my ears
I'm ready to go and I'm shiftin' my gears

So, just pass me the biscuits and give me your hand
You know, you're my Honey and you know, I'm your man
Listen to that fiddler, makin' it sing
And hear the pretty hot mix of a guitar, ring

(Ah, pick it Boy - whoo - hoo, whoo - hoo)

Well, I got no trouble and I'm feeling no pain
Got all that good music, blowing in my veins
Let the Light Crust Dough Boys, and Ol' Pappy Dan
Play us a song that we'll never forget

Now they say, times are rough and that money is time
But I don't care on a Saturday night
I got no money, but I can sing blues
When I feel like dancing, way down in my shoes

'Twas in the town of Tulsa, 'bout thirty years ago
At King's Ol' Calloway, down in Old Oklahom'
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night

(Play it back again - whoo - hoo - hoo)
