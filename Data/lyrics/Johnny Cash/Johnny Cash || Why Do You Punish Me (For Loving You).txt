Why do you punish me for loving you?
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours

Why do you sentence me, too nice of tears?
Convicting all these dreams, I've dreamed for all these years

My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free

Why do you punish me is love a crime?
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time

My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free

Why do you punish me is love a crime?
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time
