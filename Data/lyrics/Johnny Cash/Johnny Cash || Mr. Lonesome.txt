
I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be 
Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round 
Don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody 
Oh Mr Lonesome got me down 
He makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty 
Happiness is one thing he can't stand 
Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me 
Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand 
And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be 
If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me 
And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down
