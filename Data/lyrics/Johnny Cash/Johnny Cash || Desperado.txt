
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now.
Oh, you're a hard one, 
But I know that you've got your reasons. 
These things that are pleasin' you, 
Can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
She'll beat you if she's able.
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me, some fine things, 
Have been laid upon your table. 
But you only want the things that you can't get.

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger: 
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home. 
And freedom, oh freedom,
Well, that's just some people talkin' 
Your prison is walking,
Through this world all alone.

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time? 
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine 
It's hard to tell the night time from the day 
You're loosin' all your highs and lows 
Ain't it funny how the feeling,
Goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? 
Come down from your fences, and open the gate 
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you, 
You better let somebody love you, 
You better let somebody love you, 
You better let somebody love you, 
Before it's too late.
