
I met an old friend this morning
And I stopped him and called him by name
I said, "The years haven't changed you
But he said, "Good Lord, how you've changed!"

So we stood there and talked on the corner
And remembered the good times we had
Then he asked if we're happy together
And I only smiled and I said

"Yes, she keeps me off the streets
And she keeps me out of trouble
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again"

Then we stopped in at a tavern
We had us a round or two
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's
As old friends are likely to do

We sat for a while and remembered
Then he said, "Let's have just one more"
I said, "I'd sure like to join you
But best be goin' on home"

"Yes, she keeps me off the streets
She keeps me off the streets"
