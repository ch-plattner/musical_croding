You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me

And in the morning I can look into your eyes and know your feelings
We can talk to one another without speeking
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna know it
Your sweet eyes show it every morning

You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me

And in the evening I can feel your gentle softness without touchin' you
I don't need another thing I've got so much in you
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna give it
I'm gonna live it every evening

You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me
