You just wouldn't stop and listen so you got your heart run over by a mystery train
I tried to warn you from the start you must be careful of my kind
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderline
How many times I told you it's got nothin' to do with you why can't you see
But there's a difference in our music you've got yours but mine's got me
I stay up day and night for nothin' puttin' words on paper I can't find
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderline
It's a musical whodunit you know how people love a mystery
There ain't no knot untangable the only thing unchangeable is me
So if you're gonna stay get ready to go through this from time to time
I'm not quite crazy I'm not quite sane right on the borderline
