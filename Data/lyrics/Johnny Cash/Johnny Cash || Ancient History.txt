
Just walk on out the door it's all over 
Forgiving you is just a waste of time 
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it 
Cause you're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine 

So many times I've heard the same old story 
Any fool can learn to read between the lines 
And this time honey you've burned all your bridges 
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine 

I've marked you down as just another lonely page 
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind 
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you 
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine 

I've marked you down as just another lonely page 
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind 
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you 
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
