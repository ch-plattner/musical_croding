Come and love your daddy all night long
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
See that girl with a diamond ring I know where she got that thing
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say

Oh yeah honey you're so fine baby you're so fine
Honey you're so fine honey you're so fine
Oh you're so fine hey hey all right hey hey baby what's I say
See the gal with the rich dress on she can do that all night long

Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
When you see me in misery come on baby and stand by me
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
Baby what'd I say right now what'd I say right now honey you're so fine
