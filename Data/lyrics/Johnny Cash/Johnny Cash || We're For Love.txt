
I'm for you I'm for you I'm for anything that starts with us
You're for me you're for me that makes both of us for love

And if we're for each other we won't be bothered
By how much the world may push and shove
It makes no difference who stands against us
As long as you and I are both for love

I'm woman all over when you're around me honey I can't seem to get enough
Let's stay together like this forever and show the world that we're for love

And if we're for each other...
As you and I are both for love
