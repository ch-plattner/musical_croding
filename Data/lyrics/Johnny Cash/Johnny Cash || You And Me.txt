
Ain't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me

What more could a man want
Than a woman there beside him
To hold his hand
And understand
That everyday is not the same
Sometimes it's gonna rain
You are my sunshine
And I'm your man

Ain't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me

What more could a woman want
Than a man there beside her through
The bad times
We had good times
You've always been a pillow
A shoulder and a friend
And I thank God that you are mine

Ain't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me
