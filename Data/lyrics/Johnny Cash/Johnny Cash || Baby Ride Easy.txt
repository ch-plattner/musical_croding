[Johnny:] If I drove a truck
[June:] And I were a waitress
[Johnny:] And I ordered coffee
[June:] And I poured you some


[Both:] Then you'd stop by on your way sometimes later
[June:] And if we arm-wrestled
[Johnny:] I'd say that you won

[Both:] I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
[June:] If your loving is good
[Johnny:] And your cooking ain't greasy
[Both:] We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

[June:] If I were a winsome pale senorita
[Johnny:] And I a bull-fighter, way down in the sand
[Both:] While the band kept on playing that Old Paso Doable
[June:] Would you throw me a flower
[Johnny:] Would you take my hand?


[Both:] I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
[June:] If your loving is good
[Johnny:] And your cooking ain't greasy
[Both:] We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

[Johnny:] If I ran the country
[June:] I'd be your first lady and I’d pick up the white house while you were away
[Both:] Waiting while you’re passing time with world leaders
[June:] Left alone together 
[Both:] Alone we might lay


[Both:] I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
[June:] If your loving is good
[Johnny:] And your cooking ain't greasy
[Both:] We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

[June:] If your loving is good
[Johnny:] And your cooking ain't greasy

[Both:] Hey!
