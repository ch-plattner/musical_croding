
My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Cause time goes by and life goes on

Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Cause life goes on and so will I

It's been kinda tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on

If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes on
