[Johnny Cash:] When your friends don’t call you like you thought they would
When you can’t get over me like you thought you could
When you can’t forget me the way you planned to do, remember
[June Carter:] I’ll be loving you

[Johnny:] On a cold and lonely morning
[Both:] I’ll be loving you
[Johnny:] On a dark and lonely evening
[Both:] I’ll be loving you

[Johnny:] One happy day you’ll be back
[Both:] Cause you know that we ain’t through
I’ll roll you in my arms again
I’ll be loving you

[Johnny:] When your memory of me is a heavy load
When you feel you’re traveling down a muddy road
When the new love that you’re craving don’t do like he ought to do, remember
[Both:] I’ll be loving you

[Johnny:] On a cold and lonely morning
[Both:] I’ll be loving you
[Johnny:] On a dark and lonely evening
[Both:] I’ll be loving you

[Johnny:] One happy day you’ll be back
[Both:] Cause you know that we ain’t through
I’ll roll you in my arms again I’ll be loving you
