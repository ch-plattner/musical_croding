
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back 
I was born to bring trouble to wherever 
I'm at Got the number thirteen tattooed on my neck 
When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red

I was born in the soul of misery 
Never had me a name 
They just gave me the number when I was young

Got a long line of heartache 
I carry it well 
The list of lives 
I've broken reach from here to hell 
Back luck been blowing at my back 
I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back

I was born in the soul of misery 
Never had me a name 
They just gave me the number when I was young

I was born in the soul of misery 
Never had me a name 
They just gave me the number when I was young 
They just gave me the number when I was young
