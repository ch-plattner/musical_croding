The seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be

But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
'Cause the flowers will bloom eternally

Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all

As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind

The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring
