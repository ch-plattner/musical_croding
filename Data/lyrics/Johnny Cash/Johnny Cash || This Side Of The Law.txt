On this side of the law,
On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong?
Who is weak? Who is strong?
Who is for and who?s against the law?
You see, I didn't really mean and harm,
But I simply couldn't make it on the farm.
When the land won't give a lot
You gotta do with what you got.
And all I got's the muscle in my arm; bum! bum! bum!
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt my fellow man.
And it seems to me that you could under stand.
I'm just tryin' to help my self without hurtin' somebody else.
And a man has got to do the best he can.
On this side of the law,
On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong?
Who is weak? Who is strong?
Who is for and who's against the law?
Well, I didn't mean to let my fam'ly down,
And I'm not giving you the run a round.
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread.
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound; bum! bum! bum!
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong.
So long as I stayed here where I belong.
I did the only thing I could,
Same as anybody would.
And I was simply trying to get along.
On this side of the law,
On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong?
Who is weak? Who is strong?
Who is for and who's against the law?
