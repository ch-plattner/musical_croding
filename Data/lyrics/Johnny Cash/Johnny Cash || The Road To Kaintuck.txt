Down the wilderness road 
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road 
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap 

There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck 
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it 
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner 
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did 
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap 
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me 
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away 
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone 
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood 

(If you love your wife and love your baby man 
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can 
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck) 
Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck 

We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap 
Down the wilderness road 
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road 
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap 

The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road 
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
