Where are you going Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
Where are you going Miss Tara Joan?
Yesterday when you played on the swing and the trampoline
You're already thinkin' of a life of your own
And I turned around twice and you're already gone

Who will you marry Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
Who will you marry Miss Tara Joan?
Will he have wealth and will he have fame?
I'm sure too you're wonderin' just who he will be
Well, that's your decision, it's not up to me

I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara, Miss Tara
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara Joan
And that you will stay with me till you're a woman
And wise to the world before you're off on your own
You're my last baby girl and I'll be so alone
