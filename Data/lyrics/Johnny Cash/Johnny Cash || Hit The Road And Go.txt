
I woke up this afternoon, looked into your eyes
And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go

I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
'Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go

Country road 6-40, state highway 45
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go

Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain
Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all
You'll never know, you'll never know
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
