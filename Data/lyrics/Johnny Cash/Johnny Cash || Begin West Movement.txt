Broke away from British rule and took a stand
"We're on our own", they said
And they looked across the land
With a defiant challenge
They looked across the land

"We will conquer you", the colonists said
"We see your mighty mountains
We know of your lush green valleys
We're comin' to claim you, to tame you"
And the 'Movement Westward' started
