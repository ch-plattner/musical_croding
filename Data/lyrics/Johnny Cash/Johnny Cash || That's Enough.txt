I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time
Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad
Cause I can't miss a friend that I never had
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there) and troubled (he's there)
When I call him he will answer my prayers (answer my prayers)
When I'm burdened (he's there) with a load (he's there)
That's when Jesus is a comforter (to my soul)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
You know there's been a lotta times that I didn't have a dime
And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord
He heard my plea and came to see about me cause he's one thing I can afford
So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the goin' gets tough
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up
And that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there)....
