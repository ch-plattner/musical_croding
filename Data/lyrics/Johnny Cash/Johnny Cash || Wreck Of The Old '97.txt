They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time

Well he turned around and said to his big greasy fireman
Hey shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Ol' Mountain
Watch ol' 97 roll

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
In a line on a three mile grade
It was on that grade that he lost his air brake
You see what a jump we made

He was goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam

Now all you ladies you better take a warnin'
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return
