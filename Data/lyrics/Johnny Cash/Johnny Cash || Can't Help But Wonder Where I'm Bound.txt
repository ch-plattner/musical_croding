
It's a long and dusty road, It's a hot and a heavy load
and the folks I meet ain't always kind
Some are bad and some are good
Some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I've been wanderin' through this land just a-doin' the best I can
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wonderin' too (To Chorus)

We, I had a little girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
And she loved me till my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was driftin' away from me
And my good gal went off on the morning train (To Chorus)

If you see me passing by and you sit and you wonder why
and you wish that you were rambling too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound
