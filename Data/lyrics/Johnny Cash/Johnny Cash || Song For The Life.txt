I don't drink the way that I used to
lately that just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they once did
They pass more quickly like when I was wild

And somehow I've learned how to listen
to a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
it keeps my feet on the ground

The mid summer days ain't too heavy
they just flow like a breeze through my mind
And nothing appears in a hurry
to make up for some old lost times

And somehow I've learned how to listen
to a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
it keeps my feet on the ground

Somehow I've learned how to listen
to a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
it keeps my feet on the ground
