
We have drifted apart
Broken hearts, me and you
After all of this time
I'm satisfied inside to know

This memory that I had
It's more good than bad
You taught me how to sing
And bring you love

After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all

Our love didn't last long
What went wrong?
Who's to say?

If you never been by
How then could I
Begin to say

After all this time
And you're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all

After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all
