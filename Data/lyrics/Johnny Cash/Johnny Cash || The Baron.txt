Wish I had a-known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

As he walked into the poolroom, you could tell he didn't fit
In his handmade boots, custom suits, and pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown, then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around - The Baron or Billy Joe

Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady, as the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a general on a battlefield of slate
And he'd say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight
He'd say...

Wish I had a-known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

Now Billy Joe was busted, but he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table, he threw his mother's wedding ring
And he said "you won my money, but it ain't gonna do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick"

The Baron's eyes got foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he had been hit below the belt
Twenty years ago, it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left that a son would soon be born

It sounded just like thunder when the Baron shot the break
But it grew thickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long

The game was never finished; the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hands that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said...

Wish I had a-known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
