
I've giving up on running off each time i want to go
Quite a change has come to slow me down
I've set aside an empty search for something always wrong
And i took the time to look around

I've wandered down some lonesome lines and slept beside the road
Turned my collar to a freezin' wind
And i faced the day i lived alone and drank til i was dry

Givin' up for gone down to the bone
But i don't believe i'm ever gonna roam,again

I traded all my promises on things that i can't keep
Keep them with my back against the wall
Changed my mind so many times i don't know where i stand
Lucky i can even stand at all

And i fool myself and no one else til daylight drove me home
Sleeping off outback the whole day long
And i don't believe i'm ever gonna roam,again
Because everywhere a fool has been a fool has been there too
And i don't believe i'm ever gonna roam,again
