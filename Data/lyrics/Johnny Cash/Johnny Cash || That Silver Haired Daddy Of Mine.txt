In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine

If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine

If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
