There's a place I know where the train goes slow 
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb 
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove 
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell 
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell 
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time 
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes 
If you're down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist 
And I know that your name can be on that list 
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth 
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth 
He was down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
He was down there where the train goes slow

If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith 
I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe 
And all the shamefuls and all of the whores 
And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord 
Is down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer 
Never given of myself, never truly cared 
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising 
Cain I've taken the low road and if you've done the same 
Meet me down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

Meet me down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow
