Joseph was tired
They'd been traveling all day
And it was almost midnight
Before he found a place to stay

He put the burrow in the stall
Then knelt beside his wife
To comfort her
As she went through
The pain of giving life

And up above a star was shining brightly in the sky
Joseph held the baby child
And showed him to his wife

And he said,
"Merry Christmas, Mary
Let me be the first to say,
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today"

There was someone at the door
And Joseph turned to see
Some plain and simple shepherd men
Down on bended knee

They talked about an angel
Who told them where to come
In the middle of the night to see
God's only son

Then later there came wisemen
Bearing gifts and offerings
And Joseph led them all to see
And praise the new born king

And they said,
"Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say,
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today"

Tears of joy
Were gently flowing
Out of Joseph's eyes
While up above the angels sang
"Glory to God!"

Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say,
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
The son of God has come to us today
