I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
And I don't know where I'm bound.

Can't stand bars, locks, or doors,
Mean cops, insanity, and wars;
Gotta find a place of peace,
Until then, my traveling won't cease,
But I don't know where I'm bound.

There's gotta be a place for me,
Under some green growing tree;
clear cool water running by,
An unfettered view of the sky,
But I don't know where I'm bound.

When I die, don't bury me,
Cause then I must be free;
Cremate my body with a grin,
Throw my ashes to the wind,
Cause I don't know where I'm bound.

I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and I don't know where I'm bound.

Got myself a little gal,
She has been a downright pal;
That old highway's calling me,
And free I gotta be,
But I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound.
I don't know where I'm bound.
