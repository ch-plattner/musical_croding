
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town 
Fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown 
As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all 
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small 

Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee 
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he 
He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent 
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went

And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares 
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs
There he kept on helping folks get well,for his heart was jus'pure gold,
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was gettin' old. 

Then one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door 
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more 
They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content 
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent 

So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull 
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full 
Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king 
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing 

'Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well 
Donatin' an old iron casket he had never been able to sell 
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style 
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile 

We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one 
Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done 
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign 
We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine 

Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint 
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint 
But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers 
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs
