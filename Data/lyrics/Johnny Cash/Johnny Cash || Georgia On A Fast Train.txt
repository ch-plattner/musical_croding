
On a rainy, windy morning that's the day that I was born on
In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just thought I'd mention, my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning, living and a churning
Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay

I've been to georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
Got a good christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet caroline, I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny plymouth rag-top car

Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

I've been to georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
Got a good christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way
