Half a hundred states united joined together as one body
Arms that reach across the northland to the far off state Alaska
Arms that reach across the water to the far off state Hawaii
Arms of some two hundred million
Thanking God for having brought us safely thus far in our journey
We're reaching for the stars that beckon reaching for the stars that call us
And we answer back still louder by the power of God that brought us
We are reaching we are reaching reaching for the stars tomorrow
