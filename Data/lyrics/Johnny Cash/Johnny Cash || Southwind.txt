Southwind
You picked her up in Jacksonville
And left me cold and lonesome in the rain
South- wind
You took her off to Nashville
Left me chokin' in the smoke behind the train
And you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone a- gain on the South- wind.

Southwind
I need a forty-dollar ticket
And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone
Southwind
But if I had forty dollars
I would by myself a smile to carry on
And you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone again on the Southwind.

Southwind
Take her fast and take her far
'Cause that's the way she always likes to go
Southwind
I will be waitin' for the round trip
If you'll bring her back and I done told her so
Don't you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone again on the Southwind.
