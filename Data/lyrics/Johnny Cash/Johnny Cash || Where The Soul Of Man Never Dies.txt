To Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies

No sad farewells
No tear dimmed eyes
Where all is love
And the soul never dies

Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells
There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes 
Where all is peace and joy and love
And the soul of man never dies

The rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies

The love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines and lights the way to home
Where the soul (of man) never dies

My life will end in deathless sleep 
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies

I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never dies
