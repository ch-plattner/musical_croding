
Well it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready now go babe go

But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you going to do
But uh, uh, honey lay off of my shoes

Now don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, Steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh uh honey lay off of my shoes

Now don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh, uh, honey lay off of my shoes

Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue
You can do anything but lay off of my blue
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
