He was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

Got in trouble, had to roam
Left his gal and left his home
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
He went and broke his darling's heart
I guess he was too young to know

They took him off the Georgia Main
Locked him to a ball and chain
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

All alone he bears the shame
He's a number, not a name
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

All he does is sit and cry
When the evening train goes by
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

He'll be locked there in this cell
'Til his body's just a shell
And his hair turns whiter than snow

He'll never see that gal he pines
He's in Georgia doing time
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
