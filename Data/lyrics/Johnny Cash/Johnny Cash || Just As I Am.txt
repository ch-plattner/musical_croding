Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me 
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come 

Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot 
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come 
Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt 
Fightings fears within and without oh lamb of God I come I come 
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve 
Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I come
