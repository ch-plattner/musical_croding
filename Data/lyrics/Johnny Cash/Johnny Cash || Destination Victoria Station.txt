The board ain't saying nothing that's lighten in my load
Is her destination Victoria Station
Where the trains go out and the trains come in
Where the trains go out and the trains come in

Her daddy's name was Casey she lived down by the track
I know she was born to ramble but I believed she would ramble back
Destination Victoria Station where the trains go out and the trains come in
Where the trains go out and the trains come in

Destination Victoria Station
I asked an old conductor who came in from the sea
Did you see a little lady who looked like she missed me
Estination Victoria Station where the trains go out and the trains come in
Where the trains go out and the trains come in
