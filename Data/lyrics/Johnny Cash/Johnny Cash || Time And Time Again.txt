
I wish my heart was stone cause you're hard on flesh and bone
But even if my heart was stone I couldn't stand that long
Cause time and time again you're gone with the wind
And even when you're here I know you're making plans to go
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again

You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
I wanna be your man so I give in all I can
And when I give in all I can I give up time and time again
You take whole of my hand and look at where I stand
Then I say this is my last stand time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
Time and time again I got you time and time again
