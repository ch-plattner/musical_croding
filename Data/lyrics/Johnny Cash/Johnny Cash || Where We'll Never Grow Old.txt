
I have heard of a land on the far away strand 
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul 
Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die 
'Tis a land where we never grow old 

Never grow old, never grow old 
In a land where we'll never grow old 
Never grow old, never grow old 
In a land where we'll never grow old 

In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam 
We shall be in the sweet by and by 
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing 
'Tis a land where we never shall die 

When our work here is done and the life crown is won 
And out troubles and trials are o'er 
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend 
With the loved ones who've gone on before
