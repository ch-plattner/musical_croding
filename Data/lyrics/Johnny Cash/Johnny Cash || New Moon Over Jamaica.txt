
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

So won't you come back to Jamaica?
You know it isn't so far
Look up in the sky where you left me that night
I'll be standing right under that star

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

I said good evening to Venus
She said good evening too
Out there somewhere, you know I could swear
She sent a message of true love from you

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

A new moon makes someone feel happy
A new moon makes someone lovesick
I'm thinking of you, but what can I do?
New moons and new years and old love's don't mix

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

Just the new year, a new moon and me
