I was standin' on the corner with my head hung down
If I had my gun I'd let the hammer down
I'd shoot that rounder that took my girl from town

Hey the train that carried her away
Hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey you train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey train

Well there goes the train that carried my girl from town
If I knew her number boys I'd flag her down
I wish to the Lord that that train would wreck
Kill the engineer and break the fireman's neck

Hey hey train that carried her away
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey that train that carried my girl from town

Hey hey hey hey

Well the ration's on the table and the coffee's gettin' cold
Some dirty rounder's done stole my jellyroll
Hello central give me number nine
I gotta talk to that baby of mine

Hey that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey train
Oh hey that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey
Oh that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey hey
