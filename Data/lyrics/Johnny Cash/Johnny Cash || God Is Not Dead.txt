
When Jesus called to God upon the cross 
No answer came for his will must be done 
Then how the word trembled at his voice 
When he said this is my beloved son 

It isn't God but man that's dead 
When love is locked outside 
Do you deny that there's a God or is God just denied 
God is not dead he never died 

What man on earth can make one blade of grass 
And who can make one seed then make it grow 
With all the power and wisdom in our hands 
Who can command which way the wind to blow 

And who can match the miracle in an eagle's eye 
Or hang a rainbow in a cloudy sky 
God is not dead he did not die 
God is not dead God is not dead
