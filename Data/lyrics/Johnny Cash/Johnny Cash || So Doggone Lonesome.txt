
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone

If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
'Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
'Cause I get so doggone lonesome
