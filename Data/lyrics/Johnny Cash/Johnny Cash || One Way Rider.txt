
Ow, you're off and runnin'
Run just like you're scared
Run just like a grey dog
Run just like a deer

Something in the bushes
Starin' out at you
Starin' at your feelings 
Feelin' like you do

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

Lovers save your secrets trust not into fools
Don't go look for trouble it will come to you
Like some long lost passage fly in broken lines
Here in the fleeting moment really gone this time

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

Once upon a victim circumstance is due
Tend to take a hold on everything you do
First we follow leaders
Next we follow fools now we follow
Footsteps sneakin' upon you

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

Sunday drivers only way to go
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go
