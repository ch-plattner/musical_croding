Rosanna you're not acting like a child
My Rosanna's going wild
Her skirt is short
Her hair is long
And the beat goes on and on and on
She's living like it's going out of style
My Rosanna's going wild
She's feeling every new sensation
Giving in to each temptation
I know she'll pay after awhile
My Friends look at her funny
She laughs and say why honey
All I ever givin was a smile
But my Rosanna's going wild
Feeling every new sensation
Giving in to all temptation
And I know she'll pay after awhile
My Friends look at her funny
She laughs and say why honey
All I ever givin was a smile
But my Rosanna's going wild
My Rosanna's going wild
