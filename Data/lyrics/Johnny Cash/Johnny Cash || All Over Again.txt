
Every time I look at you I fall in love,
All over again
Every time I think of you it all begins,
All over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day
It only takes a memory to thrill me
One little kiss from you and I just fly away
Pour me out your love until you fill me

I want to fall in love beginning from the start,
All over again
Show me how you stole away my heart,
All over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day
It only takes a memory to thrill me
One little kiss from you and I just fly away
Pour me out your love until you fill me

I want to fall in love beginning from the start,
All over again
Show me how you stole away my heart,
All over again

All over again,
All over again,
All over again
