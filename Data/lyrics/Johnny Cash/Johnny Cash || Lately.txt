Lately I've been readin' and the writin' on the wall
Is sayin' looks like you'll be going and I've no sure way of knowing
But somehow that's what I've been thinking lately
Lately you've been saying things that I don't understand
Lately you look through me as if I'm another man
Instead of your old one and only I'm beginnin' to get lonely
I've been feeling you'll be leaving lately

You might as well just stop it now cause I already know
You wouldn't hurt me less if you just go ahead and go
You know your heart's already gone so you might as well go on
Things have not been working for us lately things have not been working for us lately
