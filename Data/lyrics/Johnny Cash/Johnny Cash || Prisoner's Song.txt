I wish I had someone to love me someone to call me their own
I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of livin' alone

I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow leavin' my little darling all alone
With the cold prison walls all around me and my head on a pillow of stone
(Make that piano cry Larry Butler)

If I had the wings of an angel over these prison walls I would fly
I would fly to the arms of my darling and there I'd be willing to die
