The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul

The poisoned air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain

"Oh," she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"
"Here," she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile"
"See," she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"
"Lord," she said, "Casey can you only stay a while"

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seein' his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home

Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancin' in the mirror at the people passin' by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye

"Oh!" she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"
"Now," she said, "now that you've a family of your own"
"Still," she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body"
"Lord," she said, "Casey it's a shame to be alone!"
