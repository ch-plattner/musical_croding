I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand 
For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man 
My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side 
For although I loved her she would not be my bride 
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splended while it ran 
Goodbye my bitter white girl I'll forget you if I can 
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair 
They told me not to love her but I did not care 
She took me to her parties she carried me around 
And I was a proud one the tallest man in town 
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams 
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens 
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there 
Until life without my whiskey I could not bear 
Oh goodbye softly sweet one... 

Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm 
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm 
But she would not marry not an Indian she said 
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead 
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me 
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey 
For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian 
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been 
Oh goodbye softly sweet one... 
Goodbye softly sweet one...
