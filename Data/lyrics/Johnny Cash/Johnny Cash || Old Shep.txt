When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd play
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at sheps faithful head
I just couldnt do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
Theres one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home
