
Lady your arms're always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
Lady in the middle of the night
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone

Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
Lady so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
Can't find the way to write it down

The days and the miles roll by
In Denver the Rambler and the Fisherman are tired of the road
And ready for whatever the city and the night have to offer
They check into a cheap hotel and go right to the bar downstairs
It's Saturday night and the city's alive
They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closin' time

[Fisherman]
Hey give me another Coors how about you Angie

[Bargirl 1]
I don't like beer

[Fisherman]
Wow man I believe the little lady here wants champagne

[Bargirl 2]
Hey yeah could I have champagne

[Rambler]
Do you think we're a couple of bankers here or somethin'

[Bargirl 1]
I like that

[Fisherman]
Abracadabra abracadabra Coors you're no longer Coors you're champagne

[Rambler]
Man I've had enough of this

[Bargirl 1]
Hey where are you goin'

[Rambler]
Good night

[Bargirl 2]
Hey you're not goin' are you you were buyin' me a drink

[Fisherman]
Hey give me another Coors

[Bargirl 1]
But I don't like beer

[Fisherman]
That ain't beer honey that's Coors

[Rambler]
Well the barman's right
Beer the bar girls too much beer I must be seein' things
I saw you sittin' on a barstool lady and I looked up and you were gone
You didn't like beer either did you lady liked champagne neither did you lady
In Denver Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
Hey maybe she's out there somewhere hey lady hahaha
Hey I ran maybe she ran maybe I did see her downstairs
Maybe she's drownin' her blues like I did
Hey maybe I did see her down there havin' a ball somewhere comin' up to me
Yeah maybe she'll be comin' yeah maybe she'll be comin'
