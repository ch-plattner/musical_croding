
Troublesome waters much blacker than night 
Are hiding from view of the harbor's bright lights 
Tossed in the turmoil of life's stormy sea I cry to my Saviour have mercy on me 
Then gently I'm feeling the touch of his hands guiding my boat in safely to land 
Leading the way to heaven's bright shore 
Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more 

Troublesome waters around me do roll they're rocking my boat and racking my soul 
Loved ones are drifting and living in sin the treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in 
Then gently I'm feeling... 

When troublesome waters are rolling so high I'll lift up my voice and to heaven I'll cry 
My Lord I am trusting give guidance to me and steady my boat on life's troubled sea 
Then gently I'm feeling...
