Till the false and the fair see the light who's to care
That you live or you laugh or the sun
Came to shine in a sweet drop of dew at your feet
Such as my heart lately has done
Such as my heart lately has done

I'll cross over Jordan someday
I'll sing on that beautiful shore
If God loves me like I love you
I'll go to heaven for sure
I'll go to heaven for sure

Oh the love that was not on the lips I forgot
Nor in hearts I remember as cold
Was down in the grace of your loving embrace
Never to die but to ever unfold
Never to die but to ever unfold

I'll cross over Jordan someday...

I'll cross over Jordan someday...
