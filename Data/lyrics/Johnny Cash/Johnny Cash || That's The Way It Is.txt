Do unto others as you'd have and do to you
You're supposed to love me as much as I love you
It's a shame that ain't the way it is
Lovers in a movie on that great big screen
He treats her like she's a queen she treats him like a king
Wouldn't that be nice if life is lived that way
It's a shame that ain't the way it is
I'd like to start each morning with good morning dear
And end each night with the goodnight kiss
But all I have is your memory with me laying here
It's a shame but that's the way it is

A love song tells a story of a good love going bad
Then paints a pretty pictures of that same love coming back
I wish that I could sing it I wish that I could paint it
It's a shame that ain't the way it is
I'd like to start each morning...
It's a shame but that's the way it is
