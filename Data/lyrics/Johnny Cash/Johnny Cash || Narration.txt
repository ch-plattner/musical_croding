You know Carl Perkins and I lived right across the Mississippi River from each other
I bet you coulda heard my Daddy shootin' that dynamite on Christmas mornin' if you'd been listenin' Carl
John I probably did cause we didn't have a lot of nothin'
I memeber we drug one ole firecracker around and wore it out we's afraid to light it
Things in Lake County wadn't too bright but kinda like Marshall said we kinda filled up on love around that time of the year
That's when the crops was all out and eh I remember my folks my mom and dad kinda pinched the pennies
And that's when we got our new overall britches
I kinda strutted around pretty good on Christmas Day with those on
But Christmas to me is a sad and a warm time of the year
We did a lotta singin' that's about all we had
And that wadn't too good
But there's a lotta sweet memories over in Lake County for me
