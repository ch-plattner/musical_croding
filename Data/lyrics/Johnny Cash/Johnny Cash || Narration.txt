I think maybe eh that I enjoy Christmas now more than I did back then
Because I think seein' my my family wife and two kids get things that they like
I enjoy that more than anything more than the Christmas years ago is the Christmas we have now
And eh course I know I was real fortunate in not ever havinâ€˜ to really want for anything at Christmas time
