Just as far as I can remember
She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts.

The reason we've not called a family reunion
We knew - she wouldn't be there
But since we've thought it all over, Mama
We know that your spirit is there.

Oh, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one Mom and sweeter than the flowers
Oh, no, there's no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt Father.

Well, it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after Dad
Oh, no, Mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead.

They all gathered 'round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so bad, you know.

Oh, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one Mom and sweeter than the flowers
Oh, no, there's no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt Father. 

Oh, no, Mama, we'll never forget you
And someday we'll meet you up there.
