
Field of diamonds in the sky, 
worlds are whirling right on by. 
Are you wondering who am I?
Fields of diamonds in the sky. 
Am I just a star in some crown? 
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down? 
Field of diamonds in the sky, 
silent beauty shining high. 
Are you tears the angels cry?
Field of diamonds in the sky 

Field of diamonds in the sky, 
like the night you pass me by. 
I could touch you if I tried, 
fields of diamonds in the sky. 
Am I just a star in some crown? 
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down? 

Field of diamonds in the sky, 
silent beauty shining high. 
Are you tears the angels cry?
Field of diamonds in the sky.
