
Someone told me long ago, 
There's a calm before the storm. 
I know, and it's been comin' for some time. 

When it's over, so they say, 
It'll rain a sunny day. 
I know, shinin' down like water. 

I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Comin' down sunny day? 

Yesterday, and days before, 
Sun is cold and rain is hard. 
I know, been that way for all my time. 

'Til forever on it goes 
Through the circle fast and slow, 
I know, and it can't stop, I wonder. 

I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Comin' down sunny day? 

I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I Wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Comin' down sunny day?
