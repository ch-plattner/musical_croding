Well I woke up this morning I had something on my face
It was still there when I brushed my teeth still there when I shaved
I showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin I gave it away I gave it away
Smiles don't cost money give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
I woke up this morning with a song in my heart
I hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start
I took my song to work with me and I sang it for my friend
I gave it away I gave it away
Yes Jesus loves me give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away

Don't think people do not care I know they care a lot
Don't be bashful of somebody give it all you've got
Understandin' means more than you ever thought it could to give it away give it away
Love someone sometime give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
Give it away give it away
