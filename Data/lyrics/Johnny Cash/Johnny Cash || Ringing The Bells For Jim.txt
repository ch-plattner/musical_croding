
The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said, "Why ring the bells at this time?"

"I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim"

Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again

I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim

On the day after Christmas
She brought him said, "Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim"

"I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim"
