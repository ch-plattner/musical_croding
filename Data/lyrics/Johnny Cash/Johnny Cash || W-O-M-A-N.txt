I just wanna tell you baby if I can I need my W-O-M-A-N
A M-A-N needs a W-O for love or dirty boogie or the do-se-do
And the F-E-M-A-L-E can turn a B-O-Y into a M-A-N

Well I can take a failure I can take a flop
I've survived at the bottom better than the top
I take it day by day and I can do alright if my W-O-M-A-N is in at night
I'm not talking good or bad or lust or sin oh I'm just talking W-O-M-A-N

I can get along without a dog or a cat and luxury is not where happiness is at
I can do without tobacco coffee or tea
And I turn down lots of money makin' deal offered me
I can make it through the hills without a jeep or a van
But I gotta have my W-O-M-A-N
I need you woman W-O-M-A-N man man
I need you and I'll kepp you just as long as I can cause you are my W-O-M-A-N
