Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
You tell me then I'll tell you
I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried

Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
You tell me then I'll tell you
