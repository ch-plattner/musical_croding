
My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state 
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks number 8 
I've always done an honest job, honest as I could 
Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie ain't no good 

Ever since we were young kids, it's been the same come down 
I'd get a call on the short wave, Frankie's in trouble downtown 
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away 
But sometimes when it's your brother, you look the other way 

Yeah, me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother should 
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good 

Well, Frankie went into the army back in 1965 
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife 
But them wheat prices kept on droppin', 'til it was like we's gettin' robbed 
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job 

Yeah, me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin', teach him how to walk that line 
Man turns his back on his family ain't no friend of mine 

The night was like any other, I got a call 'bout a quarter to nine 
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line 
There was a kid on the floor, lookin' bad, bleedin' hard from his head 
There was a girl cryin' at a table, it was Frankie, she said 

I ran out and I jumped in my car, then I hit the lights 
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night 
It was down by the crossroads, out by willow bank 
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank 

Well, I chased him through them county roads, 'til the sign said Canadian border five miles from here 
Pulled over to the side out the highway, watched the taillights disappear

Yeah, me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother should 
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good
