We never really got right down to talking we couldn't seem to find the place or time
Distance in the miles between us made us kinda stranger
And it added to the distance already there between our minds
And Cindy I love you yes I love you yes I love you
And when I can't think of anything to say
Don't be readin' something in my mind that isn't there
Remember Cindy I love you anyway

I look at you and wonder what you're thinkin'
I'm sure you felt the same a time or two
We must both remember that true love sure costs us nothin'
You just told me your affection and I owed the same to you
And Cindy I love you...
Remember Cindy I love you anyway
