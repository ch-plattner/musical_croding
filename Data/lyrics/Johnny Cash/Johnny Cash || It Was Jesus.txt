
Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days

Up stepped a little boy with the basket
"Please take this, Lord", he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread

Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord

Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago

Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised 'em from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head

Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord

Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
'Cause the stone was rolled away

He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands
They knew he came back from the dead

Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
