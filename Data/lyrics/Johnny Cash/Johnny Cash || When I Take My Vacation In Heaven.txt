
There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be

But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seekin' out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold

But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see

Sitting down on the banks of the river
'Neath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me

Sitting down on the banks of the river
Under the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me
