I've never been in prison
I don't know much about trains
My favorite singer cooks my breakfast
I like her fancy and I like her plain

I love bright and flashing colors
Like hot pink and Dresden blue
But if they ask me if it's true
That I still love you, I'll say it's true

I'd happy in a mansion
Or in an old rundown shotgun shack
I like the feel of silk and satin
So I don't know why I wear black

I love New York City
Bet your cowgirl boots I do
But if they ask me if it's true
That I still love you, I'll say it's true

I'll say it's true
So don't let it bother you
Just let them old tales all stay twisted
I will set 'em straight about you

I have not been in the army
I'm an Indian from years ago
When they ask if I know Waylon
I tell them, I think so

I do not plan on retiring
From anything I do
But if they ask me if it's true
That I still love you, I'll say it's true

I'll say it's true
So don't let it bother you
Just let them old tales all stay twisted
I will set 'em straight on you

I got plans to keep right on singin'
And I do know Emmylou
But if they ask me if it's true
That I still love you, I'll say it's true
