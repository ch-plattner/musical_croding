
From the four winds we have come Katie Elder
Four brothers on the run Katie Elder
All your little ones have grown and we've reaped what we have sown
Yes we've reaped what we have sown Katie Elder

Oh the wind blows like the devil when it blows
And the boy grows up and like the wind he goes
So mothers teach your sons to not live by a gun
And to not live like the sons of Katie Elder
And to not live like the sons of Katie Elder

I think you'd understand Katie Elder
That a man is just a man Katie Elder
They're bound to cut him down if he doesn't stand his ground
But they haven't cut us down yet Katie Elder

Oh the wind blows...

We'll try to make it right Katie Elder
No more hidin' in the night Katie Elder
I vow it on your grave by all the things we never gave
And mistakes that we all made Katie Elder

Oh the wind blows...
And to not live like the sons of Katie Elder
