
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
and my one regret is leaving you behind

If it proves to be his will that I'm the first to go
And some how I've a feeling it will be
When it comes time to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout!
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand

Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
And then you'll come then we'll see paradise
