
Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 

Goodbye goodluck may God bless you Idon't say I won't love again 
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything
