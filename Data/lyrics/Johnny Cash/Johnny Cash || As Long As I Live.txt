
As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live
It was easy said the night we parted that we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret
I never thought the night we parted that life without you could be so bad
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you the only happiness I've ever had
