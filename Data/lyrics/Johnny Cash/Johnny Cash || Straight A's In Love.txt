Well a readin' and a writin' and 'rithmetic never did get through to me
It ain't because I'm square or thick cause I learned my ABC's
But when I graduated from the grammar school and I moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books but I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra but I'd bring name C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If I made a mark for learnin' in the dark I'd have straight A's in love

Now in my senior year with graduation near I did my home work every night
And when my mama said I oughta go to bed I'd turn out all the lights
But my sweetic pie was waitin' right outside she'd be a cooin' like a dove
Though I did my beat I made some mess o'test but I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra but I'd bring name C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If I made a mark for learnin' in the dark I'd have straight A's in love
