
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another

I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why, I sat and cry every day
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
