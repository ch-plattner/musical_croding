
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home

When life's toils are ended
And parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me
There from thee I'll roam
If you'll only lead me father
Lead me gently home

Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home

In life's darkest hours father
When my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering
There from thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home

Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home
