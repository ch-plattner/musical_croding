
If I listened long enough to you 
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 

Someone like you makes it hard to live without 
Somebody else 
Someone like you makes it easy to give 
Never think about myself 

If I gave you time to change my mind 
I'd try to leave all the past behind 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 

Someone like you makes it easy to live without 
Somebody else 
Someone like you makes it hard to give 
Never think about myself 

If I listened long enough to you 
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 
Still I look to find a reason to believe
