
I'm a poor boy from the farm land 
Your father is a wealthy sailing man 
If I asked you for your hand 
Would you tell me no oh no no no 

You're a poor boy from the farm land 
My daddy is a wealthy sailing man 
He told me if you asked my hand 
I'd better tell you no oh no no no 

Your daddy brings you silk to sew 
From the finest shop in Tokyo 
He told you to turn me down I know 
But don't say no oh no no no 

Yes daddy owns a clipper ship 
And he brings me pearls on every trip 
And pink champagne for me to sip 
And you're the poorest boy I know oh so no no no 

I can't give you anything 
I can't afford a wedding ring 
A present that I'd like to bring 
But oh I love you so oh don't say no 

My daddy's three days out to sea 
And he would turn me across his knee 
If he knew you were kissin' me 
But I can't let you go oh no no no oh no no no
