You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot

It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot

Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot
