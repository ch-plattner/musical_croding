
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
I don't ever lay awake I never think my heart will break
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry

I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
I don't lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

I never call your name out in my sleep
You never make me worry and you never make me weep
I never wonder if you're true I spend a night curled up with you
And I never call your name out in my sleep

I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
