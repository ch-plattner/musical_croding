Last night I dreamed an angel came. 
He took my hand, he called my name. 
He bid me look the other way; 
I saw a man, I heard him say 

He said if I be lifted up 
I'll draw all men to me. 
He turned and then I saw 
the nail-scarred hands 
that bled for me. 
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there 

My life my heart I gave, 
my soul was in his care. 

When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow. 
This was no dream he turned my way. 

Again I heard my Saviour say

He said if I be lifted up 
I'll draw all men to me. 
He turned and then I saw 
the nail-scarred hands 
that bled for me. 
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
