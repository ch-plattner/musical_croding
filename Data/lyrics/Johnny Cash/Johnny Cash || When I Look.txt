[Johnny Cash:]
When I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I look beyond the sunset
All I can see is you and I

I believe that sweethearts up in glory
Go together everywhere
I believe the angels tell us stories
And they’ll have golden wings to wear
I believe that singers just keep on singing
[June Carter:] In a land where no one ever cries

[Both:]
And when I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I’m looking at forever
All I can see is you and I

[Johnny:] We’ve all been through our springs and summers
We learned to crawl, walk, and run
[June:] I’m looking forward to the winter
[Johnny:] When all these earthly songs are sung

[Both:]
And when I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I’m looking at forever
All I can see is you and I

When I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I’m looking at forever
All I can see is you and I
When I look beyond the river
