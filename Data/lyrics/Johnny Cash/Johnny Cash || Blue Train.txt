
There's an engine at the station and the whistle calls my name
It's callin' callin' callin', 'Come and get aboard the train.'
My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery
I'm gonna call and make a reservation for me

Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train
Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train

I'm gonna climb aboard and ride until I learn to smile
I'll be knockin' out the blues while I'm knockin' out the miles
With my guitar, beat and rythm, to the click-clack of the wheels
I'm gonna sing the blues 'cause that's the way that I feel

Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train
Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train

Conductor, go and tell the man to shovel on the coal---
It doesn't seem half as bad as long as I can roll
Give me another ticket and I'll stay and ride with you
There's nothing left to live for in this world we're rollin' through

Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train
Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train
