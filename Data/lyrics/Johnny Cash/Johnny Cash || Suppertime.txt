Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows came
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
