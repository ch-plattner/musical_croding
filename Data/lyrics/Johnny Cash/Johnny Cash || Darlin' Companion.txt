Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.
And let me be your champion: a hand to hold your pretty hand in.
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you. 

Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need. 

Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you. 

Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.
As long as we keep laughin', bear in mind just what could happen.
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you. 

Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need. 

Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you. 

Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you.
