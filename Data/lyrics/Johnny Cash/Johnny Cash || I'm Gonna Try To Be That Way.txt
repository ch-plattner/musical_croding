
I'm gonna try to be that way
Once upon a time there lived a man
Many years ago in a foreign land
Knew how to live right, tried to be a light
Gave everybody a helping hand

I'm gonna try to be that way
I'm gonna try to be that way
Do the kind of things a man oughta do
Say the kind of things a man oughta say
I'm gonna try to be that way

He never done anybody wrong
He tried to help everybody 'long
He brought a better land to make a better man
Out of the rich or the poor
Or the weak or the strong

And he preached love and brotherhood
He went around doin' good, doin' good
Everywhere he went
They knew that he was sent
And the people started actin' like they should
