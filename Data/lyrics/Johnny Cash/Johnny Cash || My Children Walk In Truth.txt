
I prayed to feel more joy in my salvation
A selfish prayer I finally came to know
For the greatest joy while living comes to me when I am giving
Giving children bread of life and watch them grow

And my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
And that they are giving you Lord of their fire and strength of youth
Yes, I've found the greatest joy in my salvation
Is knowing that my children walk in truth

It's hard to feed someone else when you're hungry
And don't try to teach when you don't understand
No one will follow you if you don't live it each day through
And a frightened child wont hold a trembling hand

And my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
And that they are giving you Lord of their fire and strength of youth
Yes, I've found the greatest joy of my salvation
Is knowing that my children walk in truth
