I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know I do

I've done everything I know to do
To catch your eye and get a rise from you
I've said everything I know to say
Till I'm afraid that I'll scare you away
I've tried everything I know to try
And if you won't love me I'm gonna die
I'll be anything I need to be
To make you want to bring your love to me

Cause I love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that I feel the way I do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know I do

I'll quit anything I need to quit
Or I'll change anything to make it fit
I'll start anything I need to start
If that would mean you're givin' me your heart

I love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that I feel the way I do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know I do
I love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that I feel the way I do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know I do
