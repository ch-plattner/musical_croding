Where chicken's twenty cents a pound) 
And if you live on such solid ground 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown 

Well I'm back on your side of the tracks 
Have come back for me to take you back 
Back to your high society 
To your cocktails and your teas 
I'll look up but don't look down 
Cause we got pride in Shantytown 

(I live down in Shantytown 
Where chicken's twenty cents a pound) 
And if you live on such solid ground 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown 

Behind the walls of your shackled heart beats pure 
While the rich have a love to endure 
Well is the gold in your crown turning black 
Is there something here in Shantytown that keeps you coming back 

I live down in Shantytown 
Where chicken's twenty cents a pound 
And if you live on such solid ground 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown 
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown
