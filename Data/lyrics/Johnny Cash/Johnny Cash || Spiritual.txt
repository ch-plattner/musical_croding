
Jesus I don't wanna die alone Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone

My love wasn't true Now all I have is you

Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone

Jesus If you hear my last breath 
Don't leave me here Left to die a lonely death I know I have sinned but Lord I'm suffering

Jesus Oh Jesus If you hear my last breath

Jesus I don't wanna die alone Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone

My love wasn't true Now all I have is you

Jesus Oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone

Jesus Jesus All my troubles All My pain Will leave me Once again

All my troubles All my pain Will leave me once again

All my troubles All my pain Will leave me once again Once again
