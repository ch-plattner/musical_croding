
To Annabel in Memphis it was just another day
But her sweetheart and his buddies died ten thousand miles away

A captain sadly walked the muddy bloody battlefield
The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the captain had his orders so the roll call begin
Atkins Baker Carter Calahan Clement Jones Johnson Moran
McCoy Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd Thomas Wilson what can of you here

The roll call was completed but no sign of life was there
Not one man had answered not one accounted for
He turned around and he walked away and looked up to the sky
When he heard his own voice echo and the answer from on high
Atkins (here) Baker (here) Carter (here) Calahan (here)
Clement (here) Jones (here) Johnson (here) Moran (here)
McCoy (here) Perkins (here) Rivers (here) and Revere (here)
Stepherd (here) Thomas (here) Wilson (yes sir we're all here) 
We are present sir and all accounted for
