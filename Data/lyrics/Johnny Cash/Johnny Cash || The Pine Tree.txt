I lean my back against you thinkin' you were an oak
I knew the wind could bent you but I can't believe you broke
Now the wind could never break me only your false love
Honey I've been true I swear by God above

I thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
You went roamin' in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true

If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm

Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a driftin' like a ship upon the sea

Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact

Come to me pine tree and we will never part
We'll put our roots down in each other's heart

Come to me pine tree...
