I got shoes, you got shoes, all God's children got shoes
When I get to Heaven gonna put on my shoes
I'm gonna walk all over God's Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven
Gonna walk all over God's Heaven

I got a robe, you got a robe all God's children got a robe
When I get to Heaven gonna put on my robe
I'm gonna shout all over God's Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven
Gonna shout all over God's Heaven

I got a harp, you got a harp, all of God's children got a harp
Oh Glory when I get to Heaven gonna play on my harp
I'm gonna play all over God's Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven
Gonna play all over God's Heaven

I got wings, you get wings, all got children got wings
When I get to Heaven gonna put on my wings I'm gonna fly, fly

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't going there Heaven, Heaven
Going to fly all over, going to shout all over
Going play all over, gonna walk all over God's Heaven
