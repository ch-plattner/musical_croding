
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
It don't matter, anyhow 
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
If you don't know by now 
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
Look out your window and I'll be gone 
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on 
Don't think twice, it's all right 

It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
That light I never knowed 
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
I'm on the dark side of the road 
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say 
To try and make me change my mind and stay 
We never did too much talkin' anyway 
So don't think twice, it's all right 

It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
Like you never did before 
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
I can't hear you any more 
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road 
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told 
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul 
But don't think twice, it's all right 

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe 
Where I'm bound, I can't tell 
But goodbye's too good a word, gal 
So I'll just say fare thee well 
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind 
You could have done better but I don't mind 
You just kinda wasted my precious time 
But don't think twice, it's all right
