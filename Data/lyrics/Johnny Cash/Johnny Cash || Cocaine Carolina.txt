Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans,
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans.

Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina.

Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two.

God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.

She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky.
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills.
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up,
Maybe I should go to California

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.

She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?

Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina...
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina...
