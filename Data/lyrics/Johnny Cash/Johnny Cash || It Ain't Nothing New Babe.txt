
It ain't nothing new babe it's just a dream that fell through babe
And the plans that you have to make will be made here and now
With your head slightly bowed
You can see life goes on girl and the weak must grow strong girl
On your journey through this old world 
You will soon understand that the love of your man
Was a shoulder to cry on and a friend to rely on but it wasn't worth dying for
When he told you goodbye when he told you goodbye

There's just one thing for certain the pain won't stop hurtin'
Till you go back to workin' with something left that you love
Because the push and the shove of the everyday day now has become such a hassle
And your only dream castle disappeared in the sky when he told you goodbye

Well it ain't nothing new babe it's just a dream that fell through babe
And the steps that you have to take will be taken somehow
They'll be taken right now cause it ain't nothing new babe
