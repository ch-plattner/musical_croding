
Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life 
If I hadn't have shot poor 
Delia I'd have had her for my wife 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis 
And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor 
And I tied to her chair 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling 
And she was cold and mean 
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

First time I shot her I shot her in the side 
Hard to watch her suffer 
But with the second shot she died 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer,
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside 
I hear the patter of Delia's feet 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

So if you woman's devilish 
You can let her run 
Or you can bring her down and do her 
Like Delia got done 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
