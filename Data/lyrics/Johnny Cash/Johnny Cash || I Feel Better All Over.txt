Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby
When I'm out with you
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you kiss me like you do

Well, I am as wild as a buck everytime you cause me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel

Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else, honey
Anytime that you're near

Well, my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel

Oh, that's exactly how I feel
