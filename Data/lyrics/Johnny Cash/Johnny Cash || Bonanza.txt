The claim we hold is as good as gold, bonanza 
Hand in hand we built this land, the Ponderosa Ranch 
Our birthright is this Cartwright bonanza 
We here belong, and standing strong, wrong ain't got a chance .

Day by day, work or play, ready side by side 
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide 
Bound to be a fightin' free bonanza, 
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch.

Every tree and flower is part of our bonanza 
The stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch 
We ride along four men strong together 
Every plain and ridge is our heritage: Ponderosa Ranch 

Day by day, work or play, ready side by side. 
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide. 
Bound to be a fightin' free bonanza, 
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch.
