
Oh you sit there and smile and you hold him by the hand
You'll make him a failure and break him as a man
You know, he was mine, yes you took the things, I claimed
Look into the mirror, woman, ain't you ashamed

[Refrain:]
Ain't you ashamed that you took all I owned
You lured him away from me with your sweet lies and song
Your comment, I'm a dozen, and things that I can't blame
Look into the mirror, woman, ain't you ashamed

These gray hairs, I wear, are not put there by age
In my book of life, your name's on many a page
Our fire of love was burning but you lured him from the flame
Look into the mirror, woman, ain't you ashamed

[Refrain]
