
I was sittin' here thinking about old times some old times some old friends
And suddenly it crossed my mind that I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk walk and talk holding hands
Said we loved each other I recall made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone and a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again

It's funny how an old flame comes back come on back make you blue
But I just saw a picture of a railroad track and some old shack and me and you
Guess I'd better straighten out my mind straighten it out go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times some old times gone and dead
But the years have come and gone...
