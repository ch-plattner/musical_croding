I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards 
When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go 
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand 
But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go 
You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you 
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go 

You won't have far to go...
