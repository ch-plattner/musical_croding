Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Christmas time is here again peace on Earth good will to men
The air is filled with joyful sounds merry wishing all around
Giving and receiving gifts stopping by to thank all of our friends
And we thank you Mary for helping give God's greatest gift to man
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Merry Christmas Mary to often we forget
To thank you for your part in giving the greatest Christmas present yet
Merry Christmas Mary
