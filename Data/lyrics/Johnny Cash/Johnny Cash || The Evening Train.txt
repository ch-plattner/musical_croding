
I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train

The baby's eyes are red from weeping
Its little heart is filled with pain
Oh Daddy cried they're taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train

As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of my baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train

I pray that God will give me courage
To carry on 'til we meet again
It's hard to know she's gone forever
They're carrying her home on the evening train
