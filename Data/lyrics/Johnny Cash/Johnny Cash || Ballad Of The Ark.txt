
Well I tell you a story about a good man 
Who had many a problem before he reached dry land 
It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
On the earth there was trouble sorrow and pain 
So the Lord said to Noah I'm gonna make it rain 
It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
Noah gathered his sons and the ark it was raised 
Two by two came the animals that they might be saved 
It ain't easy... 

Well it rained forty days and it rained forty nights 
All the earth it was covered the mountains out of sight 
It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
When the waters receded and the earth it was dry 
The Lord said to Noah go forth and multiply 
It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
Yes the Lord made a rainbow way up in the sky 
He promised no flood would ever murder you and die 
It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down
