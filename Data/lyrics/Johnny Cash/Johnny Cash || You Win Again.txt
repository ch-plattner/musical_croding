
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go,
You win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do?
You Win Again

Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do?
You Win Again
