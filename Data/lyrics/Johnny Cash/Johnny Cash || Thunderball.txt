
There is a rumble in the sky and all the world can hear it call
They shutter at the fury of the mighty Thunderball
The power of her engines, now, has drowned in the sea
But the deadly force from within her is somewhere running free

Thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand

Somewhere, there is a man who could stop the thing in time
He is known by very few but he's feared by all in crime
By courage and by fighting, he has not been known to fall
But neither has the fury of the mighty Thunderball

Thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand

Money hungry minds need a thread to launch a scheme
But those, who hold the Thunderball, could rule the world, it seem(s)
Cannot the peaceful world find the clue to where she's gone
The silent sea won't answer now but terror lingers on

Thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand
