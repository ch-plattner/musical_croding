
I'm the bad man in the movies that always bites the dust
I'm a Cadillac that sits outback gatherin' the rust
And you're the sheriff's lady in a custom Thunderbird
I'd love to tell you how I feel but I can't find the words

Cause the blues keep gettin' bluer
And the pain won't go away
Yes the blues keep gettin' bluer
I miss you more ev'ryday

Um hum hum hum hum hum...

I'm the bad boy in the corner whose faced against the wall
But I know enough to know that I don't know it all
Sometimes I go crazy sometimes I go sane
But mostly I spend lots of time somewhere in between

Cause the blues keep gettin' bluer...
Um hum hum hum hum hum...
