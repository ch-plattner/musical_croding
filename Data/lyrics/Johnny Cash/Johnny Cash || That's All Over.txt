
Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you
But that's all over my crying days are through
When you left my heart was cold and every day was blue
But that's all over I've found somebody new
Someone that can make me happy make me wanna smile
Someone I'm gonna have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you
That's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm

Someone that can make me happy...
Yes that's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm
