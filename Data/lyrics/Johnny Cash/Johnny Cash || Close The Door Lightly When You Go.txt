
Don't turn around, don't call out my name
Like the breeze, it would fan a dying flame
I've got someone, I wanted you to know
So close the door lightly when you go

Who was the one that stole my time
Who was the one that broke my mind
Who was the one that made me be unkind
It was you, so fare thee well, sweet love of mine
Just close the door lightly when you go

Save the tears for someone else's eyes
Mind of glass
They cut just like your lies, they fall like rain
And drift away like snow
So close the door lightly when you go

Get out and close the door lightly when you go
