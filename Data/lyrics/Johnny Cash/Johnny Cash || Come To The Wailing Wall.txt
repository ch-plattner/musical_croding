Oh my Lord what a mornin' oh my Lord what a day
The sound of battle's over and the smoke has blown away

Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Thank God you can stand up on this Holy Land
And touch the hallowed rock that God delievered to our hand
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall

Shout it cross the mountain shout it cross the sea
We have been delievered Israel is free

Come to the Wailing Wall...

Bring the lost ones homeward lead them to this shore
The city gates are open heaven's blessing o'er

Come to the Wailing Wall...
