
Four score and seven years ago so began the message 
Of a war-weary President Abraham Lincoln 
A message written on the back of an envelope on a train 
On the way to dedicate a battlefield 
Where men from the north and south had died at Gettysburg Pennsylvania 

Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent 
A new nation conceived in liberty 
And dedicated in the proposition that all men are created equal 
Now we're engaged in a great Civil War 
Testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived 
And so dedicated can long endure 
We are met on a great battlefield of that war 
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field 
As the final resting place for those who here gave their lives 
That that nation might live 
It is altogether fitting and proper thast we should do this 
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate 
We cannot hallow this ground 
For the brave men living and dead who struggled here 
Have consecreated it far above our poor power to add or detract 
The world will little notice or long remember what we say here 
But it can never forget what they did here 
It is for us the living rather to be dedicasted here to the unfinished work 
Which they who fought here have thus so nobly advanced 
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us 
That from these honored dead we take increased devotion 
To that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion 
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died 
In vain and that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom 
And the government of the peopole by the people and for the people 
Shall not perish from the earth
