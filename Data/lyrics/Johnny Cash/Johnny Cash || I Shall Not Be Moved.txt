I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water) 
I shall not be moved 

I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved 
On my way to glory land I will not be moved 
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved 
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved 
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

Oh well 
I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
I shall not be, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

On this rock of ages, I shall not be moved 
On this rock of ages, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved 

Glory, glory, glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved 
Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved 
Just like a tree that's planted by the water 
I shall not be moved
