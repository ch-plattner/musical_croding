Campers bikes and mobile homes cars and pickup trucks
Slacks and '59 hairdoes sideburns spears and ducks
There's lone star pearl and fried chicken and one big cloud of smoke
Plug it in and turn it on and the music goes for broke
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Linda's next time many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs

Well the Texas sun is low and hot upon the chaparral
It would be one ideal spot for God to put his hell
The most beloved cowboys songs echoe cross the plains
T Texas Tyler ain't forgotten next year y'all come again
Down at Drippin' Springs Down at Drippin' Springs
There's Russell Bush and Kris and Coe have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Rita's next how many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs
