
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee 
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload 
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure 

Let me hime myself in Thee 

In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling 

While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death 
Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne 
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee 
Let me hime myself in Thee
