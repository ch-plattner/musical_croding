
The first noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds,
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winters night, that was so deep

Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

When they looked up, and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth, it gave great light
And so it continued both day, and night

Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

(noel, noel)

Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
