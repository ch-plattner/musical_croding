No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

No need to worry
No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

No need to worry
No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

The Lord moves in misterious ways
He's wonders throught the form
He plants his feed on every seed 
And he rise on every storm

No need to worry
No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

No need to worry
No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

The Lord moves in misterious ways
He's wonders throught the form
He plants his feed on every seed 
And he rise on every storm

No need to worry
No need to cry
God's gonna bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

Ain't no need to worry anymore.
