
Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me?
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear,
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry?

Would you go away to another land?
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand?
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand,
If I give myself to you?

Will you bathe me with me in the stream of life?
When the moon is full will you bathe with me?
Will you still love me when I'm down and out?
In my time of trial, will you stand by me?

Would you go away to another land?
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand?
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand,
If I give myself to you?

Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear?
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life?
Will you still love me when I'm down and out?

Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
When the moon is full, will you lay with me?
