
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill 
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will 
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din 
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in 
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill 
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still 
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been 
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in 
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day 
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play 
When we step across the river where mother so long has been 
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)
