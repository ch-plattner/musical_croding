Everybody's gonna be a-singin' that story
Everybody's gonna have a wonderful time up there

The book of Revelations is the place ya look
If you understand it and you can if you try
The Lord is a-comin' from his throne on high

He said he's comin' back again to raise the dead
Are ya gonna be among the chosen few?
Or will you make it through?
