I guess there's not much I can do or say saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I tried to tell her so it's hello blues and down the road I go
I've never seen that guy before today he held my baby in the closest way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know it's hello blues and down the road I go

Well it seems our thoughts were much alike our likes were much the same
We even had our future plan till into town he came
I've never seen that guy...

Well it seems our thoughts...
