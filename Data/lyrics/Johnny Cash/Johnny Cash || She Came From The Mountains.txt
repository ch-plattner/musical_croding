
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle-high 
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky 
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry 
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye 

Once in Colorado Springs at the foot of old Pike's Peak 
I met a Rocky Mountain girl to my soul her heart let speak 
We went to tell her parents and an old grandmother said 
If you'll leave these mountains girl you'll wish that you were dead 
The next day I took her with me to my far-off Iowa home 
Way out on the flatlands where the mountain winds don't moan 
Each footstep we took was happy or at least it shoudn't been 
But I would find her listening for that same lone mountain wind 

She came from the mountains... 

Months passed as fast as antelopes until one fatal dismal dawn 
I walked to see morning sun shine down on where she was gone 
I'd known that lately she'd been sad women sometimes get that way 
I hadn't guessed how much was wrong until that fatal day 
She had left the weeping letter homesick with mountain names 
She was somewhere in the Rockies and I knew I'd been to blame 
So now in Colorado Springs I wait near old Pike's Peak 
Where once I met a mountain girl that mountain girl I seek 

She came from the mountains...
