You fought all the way Johnny Reb

Saw you a marchin' with Robert E Lee
You held your head high tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost they speak highly of your name
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes cause you couldn't help at all
But you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

I saw General Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched into battle with the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared it took days to count the dead
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
You foughtall the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb
