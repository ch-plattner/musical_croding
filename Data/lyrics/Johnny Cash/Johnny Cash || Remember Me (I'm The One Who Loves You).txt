
When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
