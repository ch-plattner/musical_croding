
Like a sweet rippling mountain stream 
Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek 
Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on 
So does the land just ripple on and on 
As a heart gets soft on a woman so can the heart get soft on the land 
And to fall in love with a woman as well as the land is to surely be in love 

I stayed away too long I know and every day was slow to go 
Every night I dreamed I was here it's been a mighty lonely year 
Every mile I needed you I kinda hope that you needed me too 
Everywhere I saw your face around every town I was in 
This old familiar place welcomed me again 
Back to where I belonged to be back to you and Tennessee 
Back to you and Tennessee 

Beside the Cumberland River where the grass is soft and sweet 
We ran across the fields of cedar hiding from the noisy streets 
And when the leaves fell from the cold the stars were silver the moon was gold 
I said it's yours with love from me 
I'm planting my roots in this ground and when they look for me I'll be found 
With something that is part of me you and Tennessee 
Back with you and Tennessee
