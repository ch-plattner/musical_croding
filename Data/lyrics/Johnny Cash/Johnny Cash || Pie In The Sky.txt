
From the day of your birth
It's bread and water here on earth
To a child of light, to a child of light

But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

Sometimes I doubt in fear
That I've really gained salvation here
For it's out of sight, for it's out of sight

But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

He said if I do His will
There's a promise He'd fulfill
And He's gone now to prepare
Me a mansion out there

And there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

There'll be pie in the sky
