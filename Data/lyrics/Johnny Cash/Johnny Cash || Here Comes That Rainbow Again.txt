
The scene was a small roadside cafe
The waitress was sweepin' the floor
Two truck-drivers drinkin' their coffee
And two okie-kids by the door

How much are them candies, they asked her
How much have you got, she replied
We've only a penny between us
Them's two for a penny, she lied

And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
And the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human
Here comes that rainbow again

One truckdriver called to the waitress
After the kids went outside
Them candies ain't two for a penny
So what's it to you, she replied
In silence they finished their coffee
Got up and nodded godbye
She called, hey, you left too much money
So what's it to you, they replied

And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
And the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human
Here comes that rainbow again
