By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine

Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo

Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die

Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo

And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
"Grieve not little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be"

Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo
