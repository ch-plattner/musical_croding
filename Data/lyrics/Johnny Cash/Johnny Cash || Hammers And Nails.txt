
Hammers and nails built the country,
Hammers and nails made it strong,
Hammers and nails in my wagon,
Come on mule roll along.

The early settlers waited for,
The months to go by,
Listening for the peddler,
And his things they might buy.

Many of mother waited for,
The things he would bring,
They would know he was coming,
When they would hear him sing.

Blue ribbons for a little girls hair,
Threads and needles for the ladies fair,
Get along mule move down that trail.

I've got tonics here that will keep you strong,
Books to read when the days are long,
And for the men,
It's hammers and nails.

Hammers and nails built the country,
Hammers and nails made it strong,
Hammers and nails in my wagon,
Come on mule roll along.

Yeah there was crockett, houston,
Boone, wild bill,
Stories of men with the great iron will,
But somehow some of the books now fail to mention,
The drummer who help to build this great nation.

I got seeds to plant for the black land farm,
Guns and bullets when they must use harm,
Get along mule no time to fail,

Reverend jones I know will need these bibles,
He's gonna hold a big revival,
When they built his church with hammers and nails.

Hammers and nails built the country,
Hammers and nails made it strong,
Hammers and nails in my wagon,
Come on mule roll along.
