Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam 
On the beach I built sand castles too 
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled 
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you 

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars 
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are 
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you 
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you 

I tried to doubt you and live without you 
Tried to deny but I love you like a do 
But I realize now and I'll admit it 
You'll always be a part of me cause happiness is you 

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars 
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are 
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you 
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you
