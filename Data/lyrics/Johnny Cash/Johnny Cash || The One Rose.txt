
So blue Lonesome too But still true

Rosie haunts me Makes me think of you

You're the one rose that's left in my heart, dear I love you, adore you, I do

Each night in dreamland we wander along 
Telling love stories anew 
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling 
Breaking my heart in two 
Oh we ought not to part 
I have said from the start 
You're the one rose that's left in my heart

Oh we ought not to part 
I have said from the start 
You're the one rose that's left in my heart
