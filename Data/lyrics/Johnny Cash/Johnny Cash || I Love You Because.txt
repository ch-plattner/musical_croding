
I love you because you understand dear
Every little thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you cause you're you

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred- thousand reasons
But most of all I love you cause you're you

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The glow to happiness you've opened wide

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you cause you're you
