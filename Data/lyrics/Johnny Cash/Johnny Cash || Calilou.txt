
Well I'm finally goin' back to Louisiana 
Runnin' and thumbin' all the way 
That started out way out in California 
I been makin' bout five hundred miles a day 

I covered all the beaches on the west coast 
From Mexico Crason City Bay 
But Calilou was not in California 
That's where her daddy came from by the way 

And by the way her mother was a cajun 
She came from New Orleans I've heard her say 
And it's just like a girl to wanna see her mama 
So I might find her there along the way 

Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless 
Well they should have call you drifter 
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou 

I reacall the first time that I saw her 
I picked her up near Phoenix in my car 
Just another beauty seekin' fame and fortune 
And I told her if she should be a movie star 

The next time I saw her was Tucumcari 
She served my bowl of chili with a smile 
I said it's been a year since I last saw you 
Wonder how'd you like to share a few good miles 

Well the justice of the peace was very sleepy 
I held her in my arms a whole night long 
I whispered words like settle down and family 
And when I woke up my Calilou was gone 

Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless 
Well they should have call you drifter 
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou 

Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless 
Well they should have call you drifter 
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou 

It's a long way to New Orleans 

Well I got plenty of time 

Me too you know it's lot of fun just seein' what the next day has to offer 
You never know what round the next bend 

Or what we're gonna find either 

Do you know what I just wonder how long a man has to look before he finds himself 

I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out 
Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about 
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low 
So since I've gotta button up I believe I'll hit the road and go 

Country road 6-40 state highway 45 
Life out of the interstate is very much alive 
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below 
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go
