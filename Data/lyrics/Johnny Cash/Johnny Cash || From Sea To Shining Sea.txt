
The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee

To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine

In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea

The land is big the best is free
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
God shed His grace on me
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
