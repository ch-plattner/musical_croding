
I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye 

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering 
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it 

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering 
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

I went out with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering 
I went out walking
Down that winding road
Where no one's trusting no one
And conscience...a too heavy load
I went out riding, down that ol'eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name 

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering 
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there, too
Looking for you 
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel's as much
As a man can before he repents 
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who could sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yea I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon 
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you...
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you...
I went wandering
