
Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day 
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away 
That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame 
Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart 
It cries and cries all night long 
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me 
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong 
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery 
You know I'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame 
Ah baby since we've been apart I can't console my heart 
It cries and cries all night long 
Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me 
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong 
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery 
You know I'll keep on beggin till you come back to me 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame...
