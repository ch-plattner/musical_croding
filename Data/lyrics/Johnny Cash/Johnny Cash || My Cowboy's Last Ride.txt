
The cowboy's lady is cryin' tonight cause the cowboy is out on the range
Runnin' and ramblin' and chasin' some stray and good cowboys don't ever change
I tried to hold him in the home corral but the grasses were greener outside
So I'm gonna sit here in front of this door
And I've loaded up my cowboy's fourty-four
When the smoke clears there'll be a new brand on his eyes
This is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride

Cowboy remembers the old trails we rode and he's back in the saddle tonight
This time I'm lettin' the homefires burn out and I'm leavin' when I blow out his light
Cause I still remember good waterin' holes and the places that are open and wide
And I have decied he won't put me down a filly should be free for horsin' around
And I will no longer be hobbled and tied this is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride
