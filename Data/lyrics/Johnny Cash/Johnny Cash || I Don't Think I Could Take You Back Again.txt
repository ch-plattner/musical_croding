
Now you don't have to worry about me babe
Just hook 'em up and head on out to the places where you've been
Go ahead and fly like an eagle in the sky
And when you land you'll find I'm still your friend
But I don't think I could take you back again
Ain't no need to bother about me babe
Someone will come along and she will take me by the hand
Together we will walk where the grass is green and new
And I'll even think about you now and then
But I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going you can't get there without me so goodbye go on goodbye
And remember though I'm setting you free I won't cry cry cry
I've seen you toss and turning in your sleep babe
Now your dreambags're packed you've got your ticket in your hand
When you love someone you want what's best for them
That's how it is and that's how it's always been
And I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going...
