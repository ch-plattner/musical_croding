Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before
I dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men
And the papers they were signing said they'd never fight again

And when the papers were all signed, and a million copies made
They all shook hands and bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below were dancing round and round
While swords and guns and uniforms lay scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before
I dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war
