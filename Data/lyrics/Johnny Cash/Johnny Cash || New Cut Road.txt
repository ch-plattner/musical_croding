He's a backwoods rounder and a breaker of mules
Coleman Bonner's got a wore out bow
He's been playin' all day down the new cut road

Coleman's little sister said you better act right Coleman
Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight
He's gonna get another wagon and a good pair of mules
And we gonna move to Texas we just waitin' on you

Coleman's daddy pulled up in the yard
He said pack up your lives kids it's gettin' too hard
Kentucky's alright but there's too many people
Well just the other day I thought I saw a church steeple

Coleman said daddy don't you worry bout me
I'm gonna stay here in Kentucky till the day I d
I'm gonna drink that sourmash I'md gonna race that mare
And find that woman with the fox red hair

Now y'all been movin' west since the day you got married
Well I'm gettin' off the wagon daddy I'm too old to be carried
Gonna stay here in Kentucky where the bluegrass grow
I'm gonna play it all night down the new cut road

Coleman's daddy said now what's it all comn' to
Young people these days they just as stubborn as mules
You can't make him go naw he's too old for that
It's that damned ole fiddle and that bolder hat

Coleman's mama said let the boy stay
Cause he's raised up solid he can find his own way
But as for me honey I'm with you
I always thought Kentucky was just passin' through

Coleman's little sister then she started into a cryin'
And his daddy shook his head for the very last time
Coleman's mama said somebody's gotta do it
Wouldn't be no Kentucky less you didn't stick to it Coleman

Coleman Bonner stood on the porch of that cabin
Watched 'em all go to Texas in a covered wagon
He pulled out his fiddle and he rosined up his bow
And he played a little tune called the new cut road
