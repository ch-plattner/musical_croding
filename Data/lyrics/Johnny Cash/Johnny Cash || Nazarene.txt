
Caesar ruled Rome and all its glory 
Every land called Alexander Great 
But no man can compare in any story 
With the one man who controls so many's fate 

Yes along the dusty road came the Nazarene 
Baptized by John was the Nazarene 
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene 
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene 
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him 
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene 

Nothing good had ever come from Nazareth 
An unimportant place in Galilee 
But the soul of any man could fall into bondage 
And God had promised man could be set free 

And then along the dusty road came the Nazarene 
Baptized by John was the Nazarene 
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene 
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene 
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him 
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene
