 Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
 Any old place I hang my hat is Home Sweet Home to me 
 Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
 Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
 It read it's good times here but better on down the road 
 Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
 Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans 
I'm going to get me a momma, Lord I ain't never seen
  Where was you momma when the train left the shed?
 Where was you momma when the train left the shed?
 Standin' in my front door, wishin' to God I was dead
