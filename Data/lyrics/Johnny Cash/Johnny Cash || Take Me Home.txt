
Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I seen New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and I drove a truck

Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't wanna roam no more

Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and a sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I cut my fingers on a sardine can

Take me home my heart is heavy...

Well I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' round
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas and all that stuff and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread

Take me home my heart is heavy...
Take me home my heart is heavy...
