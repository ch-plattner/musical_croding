
Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say, "Well done"

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, "Well done"
He'll understand and say, "Well done"

Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say, "Well done"

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, "Well done"
