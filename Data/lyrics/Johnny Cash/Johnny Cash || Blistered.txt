I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed

He's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go

I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills

And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
She done got me, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Blistered, blistered...
