
We are in Nazareth within a few feet of this place Jesus lived as a child 
With his father Joseph the carpenter and his mother Mary 
In Jerusalem the mother of Jesus watched her son die on the cross 
She stood by to give him the only thing that she had left a mother's love 
It was my mother who first told me of Israel stories of this land 
That made it so dear to me that I am draw like a prodigal son to relive these stories 
Here's a two thousand year old story that tells of the strength of a mother's love 
Once a young man lived with his mother beside a great forest 
The young man was in love with a beautiful girl who lived in the forest 
He told the girl in the forest that if she would marry him 
He would bring her anything that she asked 
Knowing that the young man lived with his mother the girl said 
Take your dagger and cut out your mother's heart 
And bring it to me and I will marry you 
Well this made the young man very sad 
But he wanted to merry the girl so he killed his mother and cut out her heart 
Running through the forest with his mother's heart in his hands 
He stumbled and fell and dropped the heart 
As he was getting up his mother's heart cried out from the ground 
My son did you hurt yourself when you fell
