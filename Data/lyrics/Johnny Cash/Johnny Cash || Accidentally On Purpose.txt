
Accidentally I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me
That had drifted to our old hometown

Accidentally you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentally on purpose you've married
Accidentally on purpose for spite

'Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite

'Cause I saw out cheatin'
