I'm a tramp and a gambler I stay out late at night
But a porterhouse steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this big town can afford

Well I got an electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy playin' round at my feet
I'm a rambler and a gambler and I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

Well then I got married I knew I'd settle down
And I built a little love nest right here in my hometown
Now I've got a family one that I'm proud of
I know that we'll be happy cause they're the ones I love

Got a big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep...

I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

I'm a rambler and a gambler I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
