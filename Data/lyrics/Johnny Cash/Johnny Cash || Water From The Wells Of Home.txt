
There's a stool along the road to freedom
Like a gipsy in a guilty cage
But rising has not always been bright
Destiny dreams are made

My days all run together
Like a timeless honeycomb
I find myself wishing I could drink again

Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home

I've seen all your shining cities
Lean against the yellow sky
I've seen the down, and I'll get better
I've seen many of strong men die

Well the troubled hearts in the worried men
Things that I've been showed
Keep me always returning to

Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home

I want to come back some day to the water from the wells of home
Lord take me back someday to the water from the wells of home
I want to come back some day to the water from the wells of home
I want to come back some day to the water from the wells of home
Lord take me back someday to the water from the wells of home
