
If anyone ever finds a better way to love it'll be her lovin' me
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care it'll be her lovin' me
She's every woman that I've ever known rolled up in one
And if I'm ever loved any more she'll be the one
To get it done the way it should be it'll be her lovin' me

If ever I'm down and out and need someone to care it'll be her lovin' me
If ever I'm in the cold and I need someone warm to hold it'll be her lovin' me
She's every woman...
She's every woman...
