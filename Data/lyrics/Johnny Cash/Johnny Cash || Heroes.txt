[Johnny]
Heroes, larger than life
Up on the screen, every night
On the late show, oh what a great show

[Waylon]
Heroes, under the gun
Fighting for justice, for everyone
And we follow, where ever they go

[Waylon]
Heroes, standing up tall
Taking their chances, risking it all
So you know there'll always be heroes

[Johnny]
Heroes, so good to know
So hard to find, sad when they go
Like the shadows, on the high road

[Johnny]
Heroes, ever on track
Never give up, never look back
Never lay low, oh never grow old

[Johnny]
Heroes, right from the start
They fall in love, straight from the heart
So you know they'll always be heroes

[Chorus: Johnny]
Ride on safe from all danger
Where have you been for so long
I've been waiting for another star
To rise in my night again
Give me a reason we all must carry on
Like all the heroes have done

[Johnny]
Heroes, facing the fight
Calling for courage, trying to do right
When the dust blows, and the light goes

[Johnny]

Heroes, tried and true
One for the other, ready to do
It tomorrow, like it was the last show

[Johnny]
Heroes, put to the test
Keeping a promise, doing their best
So you know, there'll always be heroes

[Repeat chorus]

Ride on, ride on . . .
