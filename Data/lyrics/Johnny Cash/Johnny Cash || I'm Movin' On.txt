
That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on, I'll soon begun
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
I'm movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, now I'm settin' you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
Keep movin' on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' on, I stayed away too long
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep movin' on

I've told you baby, from time to time
You just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on
Well, you've broken your vow and it's all over now
And I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
And keep movin' on

But someday, baby, when you've had your play
You want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on
