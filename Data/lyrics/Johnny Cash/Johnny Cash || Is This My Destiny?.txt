
Cursed with sorrow pain and woe full of feeling I can't show
Hopeless love what else for me is this my destiny

At night I toss and wonder why I must live while others die
The grave would be escape for me from this my destiny

I know God surely made for every man somewhere a maid
Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny

At night I toss and wonder why...
