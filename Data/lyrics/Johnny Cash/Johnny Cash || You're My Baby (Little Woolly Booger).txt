
Hey I love that hair, long an' black
Hangin' down to the middle of your back
Don't cut it off whatever you do
'Cause I need it to run my fingers through
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah, I don't mean maybe, My Little Woolly Booger

Hey I got me a guitar, got a six strings
And a picker to make 'em ring
Every string's gotta note or two
That I'm gonna use to serenade you
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
You drive me crazy, My Little Woolly Booger

Well I got a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah, Don't mean maybe, Little Woolly Booger

Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through
'Cause I-I'm plum-google eye'd over you
'Cause you're my baby, ah-ah, you're my sugar
WhaaaT!
drive me crazy, don't mean maybe, drive me crazy
My Little Woolly Booger
