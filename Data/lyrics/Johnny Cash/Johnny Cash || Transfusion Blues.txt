
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"

Said, "Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a read it to me"
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, "Lowdy, Lowdy have a mercy on me"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his been
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come on you guys and listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be
