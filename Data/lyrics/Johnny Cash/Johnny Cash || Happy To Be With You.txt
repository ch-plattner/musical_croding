
Happy to be with you happy to be with you 
Happy to be with you bound to follow you 
Somewhere someone above sents you to me for me to love 
Hearts can tremble and shake hearts can shutter and break 
I give more than I take cause I'm happy to be with you 
Happy to be with you happy to be with you 
Good times outweigh the bad count the good ones we've had 
We have our ups and downs but the good times come around 
Nickels and pennies are few don't have a fortune for you 
Love you yes I do and I'm happy to be with you 
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
