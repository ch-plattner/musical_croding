Also the place of the Holy Sepulchre where Christ was buried
Entering into the actual church now which is covered not only the tomb
Where Christ was buried but also the place where he was crucified
There is a very interesting story about this place of Golgotha
They say that when Christ was crucified and His blood came down the cross
And incidentally we are climbing the steps right now
Going up to the place where He was crucified
When He was crucified and His blood ran down the Cross
It ran into the ground and His blood touched the skull of Adam
The very first man ever on earth created by God Adam
And that just for an instant the skull of Adam came to life
From the blood of Christ touching it
