The lazy loafin' good for nothin' no count knock around 
Ain't been worth a honky dime since country come to town 
I'll tell you boys this waitin' up for somethin's got me down to nothin' left to lose 

And lately I've been leanin' toward to blues 
I said lately I've been leanin' toward to blues 
I've been leanin' lately toward the blues 
I've done held on till I can't turn loose 

Everything is everything and everybody knows 
We can't get nowhere by steppin' on each other's toes 
And when it comes to Cotton Corners baby anyway you get here is just fine 
Cause lately we've been doin' double time 

And lately I've been leanin' toward to blues 
I've been leanin' lately toward the blues 
Done more soul in my old holy shoes 
I said lately I've been leanin' toward to blues
