Precious mem'ries unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul 
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds 
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul 
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold 

Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years 
And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear 
Precious mem'ries how they linger... 
Precious mem'ries flood my soul
