
Grit my teeth and face a new day dawning take a deep breath then get up and go
Tie the same old weary shoes and walk the same old pathway
I never see a face that I don't know oh God if I could just pack up and go
Hungry for some other face hungry for some other place
Needin' something and I know what God I know what
I'm tired of seein' the same old road tired of carryin' the same old load
Hungry for something I ain't got
Her face across that table every morning and lately I don't notice that she's there
Always leave that breakfast table feelin' so damned empty
She knows there's something wrong but I don't care
Oh God how much more of this can I bear
