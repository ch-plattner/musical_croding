
He's not on some golden throne way off and out of space
He's not hidin' out in some big secret hidin' place
I can guarantee he'll be your friend to touch and hold
And I'm qualified to tell it cause I've got it in control

Good morning friend good morning friend
Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you will din
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in

He'll stand and knock upon your door do you let him inside
He'll be a constant comforter and keep you satisfied
He will make himself avaliable no matter who you are
He'll light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star

Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend good morning friend
Ask me how I feel this morning and I'm proud to say again
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in
