
Oh please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to try

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Oh, please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall
