God has my fortune laid away

Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
(God has my fortune laid away laid away, laid away)

Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
