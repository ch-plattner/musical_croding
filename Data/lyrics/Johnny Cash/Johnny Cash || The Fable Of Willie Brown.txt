Well I knew a boy named Willie Brown 
He was A lover of our town
Wherever he went the girls fell down, 
And cryed for Willie Brown
Crazy about Willie Brown  
Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong, 
He loved the girls and turned them down, 
A sheek was Willie Brown 
Dang sheek Willie Brown
Well a new girl moved in on our street,  
We knew that she and Will would meet, 
But when we inquired around she had not met Willie Brown,
She said who's Willie Brown, 
The prettiest girl you ever saw head to 
Toe without A flaw, 
When we met one night in town she fell for 
Willie Brown, In love with Willie Brown,  
But the trouble was that 
We all knew Willie Brown was falling too  
Then He announced

When June comes around 
She'll marry Willie Brown 
She's in love 
With Willie Brown.  
But then the girl denied it all,she said 
Its true that I did fall but he took my love for granted now
To heck with Willie Brown, conceided Willie Brown,  
Willie Brown was shocked to learn that his love had at last been spearned 
So on a Hill ouside of town we buried Willie Brown, we buried Willie Brown
