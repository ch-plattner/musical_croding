Praises sing to Christ the King
And peace to men on earth

On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people
Hail the king whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was

In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there, I wondered where
On every face at every place was, "Hurry up, I'm late"
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said, "Merry Christmas mate"
And I felt the Christmas spirit

In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din, the rushin', the yellin'
But some kind boy said, "Frohliche Weihnachten"
Not understanding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
I felt the Christmas spirit

In Bethlehem I heard a hymn, some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a Church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone, "There's where Christ was born"
I wonder if He looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit

From a businessman in the Holy Land at a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd already stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
As I flipped the pages I saw these words

And I knew what it was all about
For I read, "Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you He was born this day in the City of David, a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord"

Then I took the little Holy Book, held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay

O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight
