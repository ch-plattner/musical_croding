(That's all right John)
Cause I know how much she wanted that dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to tell her she'll have to wait
And cancel all the plans we made to celebrate
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown

Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine

Those new house plans we've had so long I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are bloomin' that she planted way last fall upon the hill
And over by the gate God knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown

Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (No I don't mind)

She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
