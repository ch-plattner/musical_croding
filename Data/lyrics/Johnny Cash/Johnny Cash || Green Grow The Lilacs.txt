I used to have a sweetheart but now I've got none
Since she's gone and left me, I care not for one
Since she's gone and left me, contended I'll be
For she loves another one better than me

Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue

I passed my love's window both early and late
The look that she gave me, made my heart ache
The look that she gave me was harm for to see
For she loves another one better than me

Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue

I wrote my love a letter in rosy red lines
She sent me an answer all twisted and twine
Saying keep your love letters and I will keep mine
Write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine

Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue
