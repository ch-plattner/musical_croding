
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you

As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above
Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine

Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you

They say that its best to forget what we had
Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then
If ever Ill see you and kiss you again

Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you
