
When the days of December are numbered,
And the earth begs it's snowflakes to fall...
That's the time of the year that Christmas is here,
With peace and goodwill for all...

How I love that Christmas feelin'
How I treasure it's friendly glow...
See the way a stranger greets you,
Just as though you'd met him Christmas's ago!

Christmas helps you to remember,
To do what other folks hold dear...
What a blessed place the world would be,
If we had the Christmas feelin' all year!
