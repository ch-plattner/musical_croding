I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
In this fast movin' world that we live in nobody rides 'em much these days
Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains

Train train train you're fading from the scene
But you've had your days of glory train train train

Train they say you're too slow for travelin' but I'm gonna miss you some day
When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past

Train train train you're fading from the scene
And I'm gonna mourn your passing train train train
I've got a thing about trains
