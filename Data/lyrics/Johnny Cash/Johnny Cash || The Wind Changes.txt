
It's not that I don't love you anymore
It's not that I don't want to
It's just that there's a line I have to darw,
You've gotta cross it, don't you
It would take so little
You know I long to stay

Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you

It's not that you can't hurt me anymore
It's not that you don't want to
It's just that there's a door I have to close
You've gotta lock it, dont you
There is darkness in our lives
We can't see the light

Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you

I don't want to lose what we never had
I don't want the dream of living in the past
If you've gotta leave I don't want to know
I never saw you coming I don't want to watch you go

Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
Might as we be history
Every single memory of you

Not until the wind changes
Ooh
Every single memory of you
Not until the wind changes
