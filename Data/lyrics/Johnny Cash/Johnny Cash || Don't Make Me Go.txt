
You take my hand and smile at me but I can tell you'd rather be
Alone or with somebody else you know
And when your eyes look into mine that old time love light doesn't shine
But let me try again don't make me go

I want you don't make me go my heart would break I'd miss you so
Treadin' love for sympathy is old to me
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
Hold me close I love you so don't make me go

I'm sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you
I took too much for granted all the time
Two hearts in love must give and take when one heart fails the other breaks
Don't make me go I wanna show this love of mine

I want you don't make me go...
