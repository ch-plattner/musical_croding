
Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you
