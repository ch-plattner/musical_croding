
Lord if you should be looking down at little me
I just like to say I'm trying to stay upon the right track
But Lord the way gets hard temptation's come and I sure get tired
But I'm watching for you like you told me to and welcome back

Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
I'm watching for your light to shine like you said it would shine when you come
Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
I hope you will see and recognize me and then take me home

Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
I'm watching for your light to shine like you said it would shine when you come
Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
I hope you will see and recognize me and then take me home

Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
