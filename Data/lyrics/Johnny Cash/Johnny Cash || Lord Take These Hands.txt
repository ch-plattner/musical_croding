
My face is scarred
And I’m seldom lucky
And the words that He gave to me then
Much later touched me

And He was pushed but He wouldn’t push back
And He was fought but not bested
And He believes now so much more than He did yesteryear
And He won’t be bested, He won’t be bested, oh no

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
And I won’t walk on by

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
And I won’t walk on by

Love is never as easy to come as we think it should be
But when it does don’t it pour down like the rain

And I won’t be pushed
Won’t be chained
Won’t be lost
And I won’t be afraid

That’s just not as easy as it should seem
So, please

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
I won’t walk on by

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope and I’m going to try
I won’t walk on by
