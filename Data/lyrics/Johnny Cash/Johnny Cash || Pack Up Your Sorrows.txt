
Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me 
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me 

No use crying talking to a stranger naming the sorrows you see 
Cause there's too many bad times too many sad times 
And nobody knows what you mean 

Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me 
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me 

No use rambling walkin' in the shadows trailin' a wandering star 
No one beside you no one to guide you and nobody knows where you are 

Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me 
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me 

No use roaming walking by that roadside seeking a satisfied mind 
There's too many highways too many byways and nobody walking behind 

Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me 
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me 
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me
