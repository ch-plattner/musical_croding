A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin' 
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight 
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine 
Cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine 

Her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming 
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay 
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time 
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine 

Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble 
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground 
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time 
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine 

Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground 
A dying man was found had survived all those around 
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time 
When he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine 
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
