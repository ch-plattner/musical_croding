
We're gonna ride the Bible train now
No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
Some ride but not all the way
The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else 
Well they ain't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off  with them
There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just
Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, well then they gotta get off the Bible train.
And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner and he's gives her that eye, you know and they
Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, this train's got a rule against adultery.
And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, but there's a lot more to get off than different reasons
Just before the train pulls out, but listen its starting to move now, listen to it.
Here we go.

As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says, 
This train is bound for glory, this train,
This train is bound for glory, this train,
This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy, 
This train is bound for glory, this train

This train is a free train, this train, 
This train is a free train, this train, 
This train is a free train, 
Everybody rides in Jesus' name

This train is a free train, this train, 

This train it don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars, this train  
This train don't pull no liars, 
No false pretenders and no backbiters
This train don't pull no liars, this train.

This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train, 
Everybody rides it in Jesus' name
This train is a clean train, this train

Do you want to ride it children, this holy train'
Do you want to ride it children, this righteous train'

Get on board 
Get on board 
Get on board 
Get on board this holy train
Get on board 
Get on board 
Get on board this holy train
