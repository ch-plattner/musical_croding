Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike
She crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
With two yoke of oxen and a big yellow dog
And a tall Shanghai rooster and one spottled hog.

Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
Saying Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes.

Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Betsy got up in the great deal of pain
She said she'd go back to Pike County again
But I gave a sigh then he fondly embraced
And he traveled along with his arm round her waist.

(How can sweet Betsy went out to the dance
And Ike poor a fellow he's down at his pance)
Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings
Said Iken you're an angel but where are your wings.

Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Well, the miner said Betsy will you dance with me
She answere I will if you want make two free
I can't dance too hard do you want to know why
Because I'm so full of that strong out cooli.

Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course
But Ike was so jealous he gotta divorce
And Betsy well satidfied said with a shout
Goodbye forever I'm glad you've backed out.

Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei...
