
Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go
But you're planning no returning you wild Colorado

If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado

Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado

If I had no love of life...
