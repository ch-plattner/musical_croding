It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska
To homestead some of that free government land
Forty miles from the nearest gravel road we cut our
life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider
laying in my arms
I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born

Jim was born the first year we were here look at him
Diana he's almost grown
And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think
in no time they'll be up and gone
What have you got planned

Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana
It's been almost two years now since you've been gone
Think children grew up so fast
But I guess they deserve to see the world now don't they
But you know Diana remembering how you loved me
And how much I love you I don't feel so alone
What have you got planned
What have you got planned
