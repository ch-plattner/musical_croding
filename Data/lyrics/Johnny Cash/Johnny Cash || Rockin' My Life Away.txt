
From 1492 to 1998
I threw a rock 'n' roll party on my last birthday
Feels good, rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin' and I'm havin' fun night and day

Streamline, fleet line, military brat
I got the general's daughter, taught her where it was at
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin' and I'm havin' fun night and day

I know a gal from Texas, she chilli pepper hot
She knows hot to reel it and knows how to rock
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin', havin' fun night and day

You know, I like to party and I like to have fun
I'd like to kill her, I've got-a rock on
C'mon, rockin' my life away
Movin' and groovin', I'm havin' fun night and day

How about you girl?

You know, I like some long and I like some lean
I like the way that you shake that thing
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin', I'm havin' fun night and day

I gotta have it one more time girl

From 1492 to 1998
I threw a rock 'n' roll party on every birthday
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
Sayin' a movin' and groovin', havin' fun night and day

I'm rockin'
Rockin'
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin', I'm gettin' some night and day
