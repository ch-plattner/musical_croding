
Tears keep rolling down your cheek
Your voice gets choked so you can't speak
Every day seems like a week
And that's what it's like to be lonesome

You get too blue to stay at home
But in a crowd you're still alone
You lose the will to carry on
And that's what it's like to be lonesome

Everyone has a hope that's died
Everyone cries a tear inside
Everyone has a cross to bear
But I've got more than my share

Your mind is built with memories
Your heart cries out for sympathy
An empty blue eternity
And that's what it's like to be lonesome
