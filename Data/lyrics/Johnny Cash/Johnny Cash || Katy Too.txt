
I'm not the going steady kind
I miss 'em all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too

If you should see miss Mary-Ann
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too

I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitchin' wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still like ol' Katy too

Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

To all the girls I make this toast
I love you eveyone the most
But don't ask me to say "I do"
'Cause I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

Cupid you bet you been good to me
I got more girls than I can see
But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Let's squeeze in ol' Katy too
