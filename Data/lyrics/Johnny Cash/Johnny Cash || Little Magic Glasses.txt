
I wish I had a pair of little magic glasses
That I could see the future just by lookin' through
Then I could know what road tomorrow's gonna take me down
And I could see if I'll be walkin' down that road with you

I would keep my little magic glasses hidden
I would let nobody else see what I see
And everyone would want to know how I can know what lies ahead
And they'll wonder when I say tomorrow I see you with me

But if I see into the future that I'm on the road alone
And where the way was sunny, now there's only rain

I'll put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
I will put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
