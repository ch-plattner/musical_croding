
They used to call me Rockabilly
All of us ran through
When Elvis opened up the door
With a pup-and-pup-and-boo

I didn't ever play much rock and roll
'Cause I got so much country in my soul
But I'm a different man for lovin' you
And I take a shot at what you ask me to

And baby I will rock and roll with you
If I have to

Memphis 1955 on Newton Avenue
Carl and Jerry and Charlie and Roy
And Billy Riley too

A new sun risin' on the way we sing
And a world of weirdo's waitin' in the wings
But I love you and though I'm past 42
There are still a few things yet I didn't do

And baby I will rock and roll with you
If I have to
