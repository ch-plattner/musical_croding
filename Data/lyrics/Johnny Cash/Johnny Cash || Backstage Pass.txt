One night I had a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show

There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show

Kristofferson got an offer for a movie promoters closed another deal or two
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter and he went home the minute he was through
I moved with the mob at intermission
To the green room where you see who you can see
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
Paupers punks and millionaires and me
And there were wackoes...

Hells Angels blocked the traffic to the building
In order for the beer truck to come through
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
There were women who once did and some who still would
I heard one ask did Connie come along
And there were wackoes...
I wish you could've been there well maybe you were
