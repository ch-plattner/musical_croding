Then came Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico was 47
48 was Arizona and the land was all a Union
Now a proud strong land swelled its chest and kept on growing
She survived many wars but now the great war the war to all the wars
Dealth her a stunning blow
Two million men shipped overseas to help win the great war
