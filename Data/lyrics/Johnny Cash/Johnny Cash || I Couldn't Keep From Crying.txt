
I saw you walking by his side
Heard you whisper all those lies and I
Couldn't keep from crying

You sang him love songs tenderly
Just the way you sang to me me and I
Couldn't keep from crying

I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place

I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying

I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place

I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying
