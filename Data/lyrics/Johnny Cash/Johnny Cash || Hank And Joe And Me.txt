
In the desert where we searched for gold
The days're hot the nights're cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on
So bold and brave and free

For days and days we fought the heat
I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go
I heard Hank say to Joe

He's dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Hear him cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water

Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water

I don't remember how long I lay
But when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead
I knew Hank and Joe were dead

My eyes were dimmed but I could see
A bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long
Till they decorate my bones

'Cause I'm dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Can't help cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water

Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water
