Go on blues go on lonesome
Get your dark clouds off of me
Go on blues go on troubles
Turn loose of me set me free

I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues

I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues

Yeah go on blues go on by me
Get away from me go on blues
