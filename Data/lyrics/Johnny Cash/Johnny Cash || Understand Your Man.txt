
Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leavin'
I won’t even turn my head.
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
I’ll be gone, like I said.

You’d just say the same old things
That you be sayin'all along,
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
Till I’m gone.
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan

Understand your man.
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man.

Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army,
And everything else I leave behind --
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind.
I ain't gonna repeat what i said anymore.
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as the wild gruesome winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man.
