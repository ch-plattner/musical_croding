
Well I'm gonna start out walkin' 
Just you wait and see 
Uh-huh guitar picker 
You ain't leavin' without me 

Oh you big mouth woman 
You long legged guitar pickin' man 
But we can work this out uh huh 
Yes ma'm I think we can 

Well I stole the Hope diamond 
Hopin' I could shut your mouth 
But how am I gonna wear it 
If I got to hide it out 

Well you big mouth woman 
You long legged guitar pickin' man 
But we can work this out uh huh 
Yes ma'm I think we can 

Well I bought you a first class ticket 
For a luxury liner cruise 
I got out in that ocean 
looked around and there was you 

Oh you big mouth woman 
You long legged guitar pickin' man 
But we can work this out uh huh 
Yes ma'm I think we can 

I bought you a big long limousine 
But I don't want no car 
I gave my love and everything 
But you're still what you are 

You're just a big mouth woman 
You long legged guitar pickin' man 
But we can work this out uh huh 
Yes ma'm I think we can 

Oh honey I love that big sweet mouth 
You a long legged guitar pickin' man 
Ha ha I'm gonna pick it for you 
Now you a nice guitar pickin' man
