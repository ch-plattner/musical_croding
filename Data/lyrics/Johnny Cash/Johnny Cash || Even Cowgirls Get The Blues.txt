
She's a rounder I can tell you that 
She can sing 'em all night, too 
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Especially cowgirls, they're the gypsy kind 
And need their laid on 'em loose 
She's lived to see the world turned upside down 
Hitchin' rides out of the blues 

But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Lonely nights are out there on the road 
Motel ceiling stare you down 
There must be safer ways to pay your dues 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like the restless wind 
The only way she's ever been

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like the restless wind 
The only way she's ever been
