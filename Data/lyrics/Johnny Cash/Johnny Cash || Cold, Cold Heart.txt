
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
