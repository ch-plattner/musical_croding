
So here is the stable and there is the manger
The new Saviour sleeps on His first earthly night
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle
It's all that we have but it gives a good light

We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains
We left our flocks when the new star appeared
Oh, the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir
We had to come see Him, we had to come here

We beg You forgive us for such a small offering
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night
We bring You this candle it's all we have with us
But with it the new Saviour has His first light
We are the shepherds

We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine
'Tis only one candle but it is our symbol
Of how we believe that His great life will shine
We are the shepherds
