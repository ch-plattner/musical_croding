
The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound

Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away

And just before the sunrise
I heard somethin' at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call

I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet

But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
And John stood there beside me
As she told me where, she'd been

"They've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The Stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there"

We both ran toward the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said

But the windin' sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where, they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell

Oh, somethin' strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go

Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
I'd seen them crucify Him
And I saw Him die

Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything, I had promised Him
Just added to my shame

When at last it came to choices
I denied, I knew His name
And even if He were alive
It wouldn't be the same

Suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room

And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried

He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies

Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace

He's alive, He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive, He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide

He's alive, He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's alive
