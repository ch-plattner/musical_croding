Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
