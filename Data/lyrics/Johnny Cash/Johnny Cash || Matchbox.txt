I said I'm sitting here watching 
Matchbox holdin' my clothes 
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
Matchbox holdin' my clothes 
I ain't got no matches 
But I sure got a long way to go 

I'm an old poor boy 
I'm a long way from home 
I'm an old poor boy 
And I'm a long way from home 
I've never been happy 
Cause everything I ever did was wrong 

Well, if you don't want my peaches 
Honey please don't shake my tree 
If you don't want any of those peaches 
Honey, please don't mess around my tree 
I've got news for you baby 
Leave me here in misery, all right! 

Well let me be your little dog 
Till your big dog comes 
Let me be your little dog 
Till your big dog comes 
And when your big dog gets here 
Watch how your puppy dog runs 

Well I said I'm sitting here watching 
Matchbox hole in my clothes 
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
Matchbox hole in my clothes 
I ain't got no matches 
But I sure got a long way to go
