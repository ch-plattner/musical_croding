
Mountain lady do you sit on your front porch in the cool of the day
Mountain lady did you think your kids would ever come back to stay
Mountain lady does the columbine still twine around your door
And did you ever get a rug
To cover the cracks where my diaper drug on your wooden floor
Oh you appalachian lady once i was your little baby
And you rocked me in your homemade rockin' chair
Since i heard the wild goose callin' i have done a lot of fallin'
Mountain lady someday i'll come to you there

Mountain lady does the country church bell ring on sunday morn
Mountain lady do you still wear that old apron ragged and torn
Mountain lady on winter nights before our old fireplace
As you look into the flame do you ever call my name and do you see my face
Oh you appalachian lady...
Mountain lady
