Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none 
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine 
He got a gun, shot a night clerk, now they call him Johnny 99 

Down at the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop 
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and a-threatin' to blow his top 
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind 
In front of the club Tip Top, they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99 

Well, the city suplied the public defender, but the judge was mean John Brown 
He came into the courtroom and he stared poor Johnny down 
Well, the evidence is clear, gonna let the sentence fit the crime 
Ninety-eight and a year will make it even, Johnny 99 

A fist fight broke out in the courtroom, they had to drag Johnny's girl away 
His mama stood up and shouted, judge don't take my boy this way 
Well son you got any statements you'd like to make 
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away 

Yes, judge I got debts no honest man could pay 
The bank was holdin' my mortgage, they was takin' my house away 
Now, I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man 
But it was more than all this that put that gun in my hand 

And, your honor, I do believe I'd be better off dead 
If you can take a man's life for the thoughts that are in his head 
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over one more time 
And let them shave off my hair and burn Johnny 99
