
I've been a rambler, I've been a gambler
I've been in trouble a time or two
I known a lot good looking women
But Lord, bless the day that I found You

I'm alright now, I'm alright now
I was ridin' on the devil's train but I got off somehow
I'm alright now, I'm alright
Gabriel, let your trumpet blow, I'm alright now

I've been demented, been discontented
I've been in jail pretty close to hell
I've been frisky on sipping whiskey, yeah
And I done a few other things that I'll never tell

But I'm alright now
I'm alright now
I'm alright now
