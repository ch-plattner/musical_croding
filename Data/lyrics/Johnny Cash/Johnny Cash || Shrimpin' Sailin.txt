To talk on the speak 'cause you know okay
Darn those smart alec, crazy cajon boy
Come in to my nice clean kitchens

And get into my pantry, get my blackberry jim jam
That I'd pick blackberries
And make a jim jam in the winter time
To take out on the shrimpin' boat

And bring in a foldin' wads
Of wondrous waddy for my little wienies
And they come in to my blackberry jim jam
In the pantry and get them all over
The nice clean kitchen table cloth
The smart alec cajon boy will play the music

Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin

Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse

Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Till it's time to haul 'em and come back in with the briny bin

Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy eatin' carmel candy
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy
For the livin' that I'm lovin' in between the shrimpin' sailin'

Gulf, it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'

Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Till it's time to haul 'em come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eatin' chicken
Finger lickin', dancin', rancin', mancin', tancin'
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy
