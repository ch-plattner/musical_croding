In April of 1775 
This great nation started comin' alive 
Ol' King George didn't like it one bit 
So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit 

He told his generals better get 'em back in line 
Make 'em pay my taxes now America is mine 
Stop that Independence cops before it gets around 
Or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down 

Well the King was talking bout the men like Paul Revere 
And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear 
They kept their eyes on the British they watched 'em day and night 
They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight 

Yes they knew that the British would get movin' any hour 
So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower 
Paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light 
And he started on his midnight ride 

He jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin' 
He screamed out his warning redcoats're comin' 
Better get your guns and your fightin' britches on 
They're comin' and they're eight hundred strong 

Next mornin' at Concord and Lexington town 
The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around 
When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here 
Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere 

I guarantee you somethin' and I wanna tell you all 
That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul 
Yes sir I surely doubt us ever bein' here 
If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere
