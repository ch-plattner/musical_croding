Well it's been something seeing you again 
And in this time we've had to spend 
You've been so good to be around 
I thank you for that special thrill 
Keeps me going on until the next time I'm in town  

Though I won't be back here for a while 
I'll hear your laughter see your smile
I'll remember what went down
Though I don't know how or when
I'll be seeing you again the next time I'm in town  

Until the next time that I'll be passing through 
Think of all the things we've go to look forward to 
Checking up on old friends staying up all night long 
Playing jukebox music singing old country songs 
Now the faces and the places range across the bridge of time 
And change and once again I'm homeward bound 
But there's one thing I promise you 
And that's another rendezvous the next time I'm in town
