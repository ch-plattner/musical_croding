
Leaving in a cloud of burning cinders cinders from a fire of love gone out
Never looking back when she's highbolling
She's the daughter of a railroam man no doubt
Waking in a new bed every morning breaking in a new heart every night
Up and running while the world is sleeping
She's the daughter of a railroam man alright
She is long and sleek and made for moving she's outward bound at any time she can
She won't be staying long in any station she's the daughter of a railroam man

Cries out in the night when she gets lonely you can bet she won't be lonely long
On down the line someone waits her arrival and the daughter of a railroad man is gone
She is long and sleek...
