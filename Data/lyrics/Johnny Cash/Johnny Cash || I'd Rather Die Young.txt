
I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
To see someone's picture where my picture hung 
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young 
I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care 
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair 
Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me 
I'd rather die young.. 

I'd rather die young...
