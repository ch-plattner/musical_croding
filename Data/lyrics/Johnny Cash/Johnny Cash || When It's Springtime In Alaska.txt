
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below
