Hmm an old man on his deathbed once said to me
You are the master of your destiny
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips're all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had

So you laugh when it's time to laugh and you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live cause you'll die when it's time to die hmm

Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home

A diamond is a diamond

Well now that I'm older I found this is true
The thing that remains is the good that you do
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
God is the best friend that you've ever had
God is the best friend that you've ever had

So you laugh when it's time
