
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie
Well here I am and there you go, you're gone again
I know you're gonna be the way you've always been
Breakin' hearts and tellin' lies is all you know
Another guy gives you the eye and there you go
There you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

Because I love you so I take much more than I should take
I want you even though I know my heart is gonna break
You build me up and for a while I'm all a-glow
Then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go
Thre you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie
