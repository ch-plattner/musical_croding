
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen

Each giving to the other love and givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
'Cause you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow

You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming

And even if you leave me I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the loving gift you gave me
'Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby
