You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly 
It's a heart that needs your everloving care 
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair 
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love 
Shelter it from harm along life's way 
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly 
It's a heart that will not ever go astray 
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know 
You have but to speak and my heart will obey 
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so 
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may 
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why 
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows 
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky
