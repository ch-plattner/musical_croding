Well I used think the color of love would be a
Rosy red or a pretty pink And I thought it would
Be a thirsty man crawlin' home to get a big old
Drink And I thought love was spelled like a bell
B-E-double L bell that you ring Stead of wham bam
Hit your man with a pan Hit him on the head hear
The birdies sing

Oh you heart breakin' love makin' cut
Me-a-piece-of-bacon man of mine And you money
Shiftin' flour siftin' nose liftin' rose of woman
Kind Just keep on doin' what you're doin' what
You're doin' suits me just fine And love I tell
You somethin' else you blow my mind

Well I used to think the color of love would be a
Soft green like a pea in a pod And I thought love
Would strike like a light flashin' down a big old
Lightnin' rod And I thought love was spelled
W-E-double L well that would never run dry Stead
Of choke choke I'm so broke and dry I can't afford
A little bitty tear to cry

Oh you money turnin' egg churnin' butter burnin'
Baby of mine You half crazy lean and lazy pretty
As a wilted daisy man of mine Just keep on
Doin'... You blow my mind you blow my mind you
Blow my mind you blow my mind
