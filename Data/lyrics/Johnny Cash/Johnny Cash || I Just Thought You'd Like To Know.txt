
I just thought you'd like to know
Since you'd made your plans to go
It's gonna hurt me so to see you go
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do

I just thought I tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew

I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that you'd like to know
