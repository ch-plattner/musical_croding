She soon could wear a cocktail dress again
But we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
This will be our first and I'm proud the baby is mine

Yes, I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
And if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
Don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

She's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
Where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
And her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
Mister don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
If you'd mind your own business we'd make it fine
Tell all her old friends I'm proud the baby is mine
