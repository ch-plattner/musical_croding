Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free 
Like a fish on a hook 
Like a knight from an old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons with thee

And if I have been unkind 
I hope that you will just let it go by 
And if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn 
Like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song 
By all I have done wrong 
I'll make it all up to you

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch 
He called out to me "Don't ask for so much" 
And a young man leaning on his darkened door 
He cried out to me "Hey, why not ask for more"

Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free
