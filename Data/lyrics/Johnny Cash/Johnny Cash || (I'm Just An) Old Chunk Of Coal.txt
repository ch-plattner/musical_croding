
I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow
'Til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
'Til I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' Rage of the Age
Yes I'm gonna be a diamond some day 

I said I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
