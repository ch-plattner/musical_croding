
We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt

"Don't step on Mother's roses," Daddy cried
"She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place"

"Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow"

Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say

"Don't step on Mother's roses," Daddy cried
"She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place"

"Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow"
