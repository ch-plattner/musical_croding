
Let me down easy if you must go why not deceive me it won't hurt me so 
Truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and I'll get by 
Let me down easy for old time's sake 
Is it too much to ask when my heart's gonna break 
I'm bound to lose you I'm bound to cry oh let me down easy and I'll get by 

Let me down easy..
