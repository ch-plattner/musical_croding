(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.) 
(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.) 
The place I go to draw my pay, 
Closed the door on me today. 
Told me just to stay away, 
And don't come back again. 
Ahh: I told my Mama: "Baby, don't you cry. 
"I'll get a job before the day go by." 
I don't know where, and that is why, 
I'm a worried man. (Worried.) 
Worried man, a worried man. 
(Worried.) (Worried.) 
I'm a very worried man. 
Hungry babies don't understand, 
And their Papa is a worried man. 
Papa is a worried man. (Play it, Johnny,) (Yeah.) 
There is no way that I can see, 
That I can feed my family, (That's sad.) 
I don't own a money tree: 
An' I don't own no land. 
Now listen: I've got muscle and I've got brains. 
I don't mind the sun an' the rain. 
I gotta make a little change, 
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh. (Worried.) 
Worried man, a worried man. 
(Worried.) (Worried.) 
I'm a very worried man. (Worried man.) 
Hungry babies don't understand, 
And their Papa is a worried man. 
Their Papa is a worried man. (Take it: take it.) 
(That's it, (That's it, that's it, that's it.) 
(Ok, do it: go Willie.) 
(Worried man, worried man.) 
(Papa is a worried man.) 
(Worried man, worried man.)
