Stop lovin' me a little at a time, let me lose you a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me a little at a time

For my benefit try to cry a little bit
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
I put up a fight but i'll be all right if you stop lovin' me a little at a time

Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go leave me, a little at a time

For my benefit try to cry a little bit
A little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time
