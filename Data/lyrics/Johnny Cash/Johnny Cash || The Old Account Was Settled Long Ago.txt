An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven 
My name was at the top and many things below 
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all) 
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah) 
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away 
And the old account was settled long ago 
Well the old account was large and growin' every day 
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray 
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe 
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees)... 

Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins 
Cause this he has commanded if you would enter in 
And then if you should live a hundred years below 
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees)...
