Darling the seasons are changing see now the leaves how they die
Love needs no reason for ending come kiss your baby goodbye
Darling the last time you lied was it really the last time
Have all the tears that you've cried simply dried up and gone
All in the world you can hurt anymore is my feeling
Whatever love ever was never lasted too long
Maybe the best of our life was a beautiful dream babe
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles in sand
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter
Let her keep making believing as long as she can
Now and again I still hear some old songs I don't want to
Is it the same over there where you found your new friend
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel something missing
Maybe I'll never believe in forever again
Darling the seasons are changing see now the leaves how they die
Love needs no reason for ending come kiss your baby goodbye
