And when she goes she won't come back no more
There ain't nothing like it when you've got her all alone
And there's not anything that can replace her when she's gone

Oh, I envy you until the day she walks back out your door
And that she's gonna do 'cause she's a go-er
Now don't let her stay too long she'll take the heart
Right out of your song, you'll pay the price for her one time
But she won't be back anymore, I just thought I'd tell you she's a go-er

Yes I guess, I should have told you she's a go-er
I should have told you that way back long before
But I was trying to overcome the pain she put me through
I was fightin' to forget her when she got around to you

Oh, you'll be Heaven high till she don't want you anymore
Then she'll be gone again cause she's a go-er
Now don't let her stay
