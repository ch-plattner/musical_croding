
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers 
Oh, what a dream 
The houses all were silver towers 
Oh, what a dream 
Beside the road an angel sat, 
I said hello and tipped my hat 
And stopped when I saw her smile 
And set me down a while 
I set me down a while 
You dreamer you

I tried the angel for a kiss 
Oh, what a dream 
But she turned away and my lips missed 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I'll have you know 
I met you just a while ago 
You're welcome for to sit 
But calm yourself a bit, sir 
Calm yourself a bit 
You dreamer you

I fell in love like one, two, three 
Oh, what a dream 
I asked the angel to marry me 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I can't marry you, 
But I'm a dream that can come true 
There are dreams of much my worth 
That live upon the earth, sir 
Live upon the earth 
You dreamer you"

Then I awoke and found my love 
Oh, what a dream 
As heavenly as the one above 
Oh, what a dream 
We'll marry in a sea of flowers, 
Home will be a silver tower 
There'll be heaven in my life 
With an angel for a wife 
With an angel for a wife 
You dreamer you 
You dreamer you
