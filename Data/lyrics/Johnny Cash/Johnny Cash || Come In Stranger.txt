It's good to have you home
I hurried thru 'cause I knew it was you
When I saw your dog, waggin' his tail
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail
You've been gone so long

She said come in stranger
I know you're weary from all your miles
Just sit right there in your easy chair
And tell me all about the places you've been
How long it'll be before you leave again
I hope it's a long, long while

She said come in stranger
Everything 'round home is fine
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back
And I missed you all the time

She said come in, stranger
Oh how I need you when you're gone
I walk the floor and I watch the door
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be
I'd give anything to have you here with me
I get so lonesome all alone

She said come in, stranger
And won't you listen to my plea
Stay long enough, so that the one I love
Is not a stranger to me
