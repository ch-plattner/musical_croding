
Out on a shrimp boat I just dropped the net
When the wind she come to blowin' whizzin' bad all to get
I look south east and golly me what I see
A black thundercloud with them fuzzy eyebrows
Come a lookin' direct towards boudleaux and me

I turned to boudleaux and me I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Lock up the coffee in the coffee pot
Put the flour in your pillow cause it's all we got
Hang the lantern from the ceiling and watch your head
Ho boudleaux put the sugar to bed boudleaux put the sugar to bed

Well the sky she get dark and then she turn dark black
I yell she gonna blow one right out of the almanac
A big raindrop smacked me right on the ear
And I hollered hey boudleaux but the way the wind blow
He just as soon be deaf there wasn't no how to hear
I try to call to boudleaux but slid instead
Then me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed

Well the ends of that shrimpin' boat was switchin' around
She turned sideways and inners and outers and upside down
The water come in tryin' to drown the both of us
The closet top open and the shillet went a flyin' me I hit my head and kinda cuss

But most of all I frowned when she calm that I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Ain't nothin' dry but my railroad watch the salt got soggy but we still can budge
We built a fire for the coffee and we chicory fed
Cause me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
