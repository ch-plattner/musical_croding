There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home 
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand 
Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes 
But it's only seven miles to Maryanne 
It's only seven miles to MaryAnne 

You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime 
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan 
Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die 
But it's only five more miles to Maryanne 
It's only five more miles to MaryAnne 

That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a women's scream 
And we'd best be movin' faster, if we can 
Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm 
It's only three more miles to Maryanne 
It's only three more miles to MaryAnne 

Come on Dan get up, you honory cuss or you'll be the death of us 
I'm so weary but I'll help you, if I can 
All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while and rest 
For it's still another mile to Maryanne 
It's still another mile to MaryAnne 

Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn 
He'd made it but he couln't leave ol' Dan 
Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns 
He was just a hundred yards from Maryanne 
He was just a hundred yards from MaryAnne.
