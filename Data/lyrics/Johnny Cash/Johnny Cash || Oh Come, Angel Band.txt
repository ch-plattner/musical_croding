
My latest sun is sinking fast,
My race is nearly run;
My strongest trials now are past,
My triumph is begun. 

Oh, come, angel band,
Come and around me stand;
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home;
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home.

I know I'm near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dearâ€”
I hear the waves on Jordan's banks,
The crossing must be near. 
I've almost reached my heav'nly home,
My spirit loudly sings;
Thy holy ones, behold, they come!
I hear the noise of wings. 
Oh, bear my longing heart to Him,
Who bled and died for me;
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin,
And gives me victory.
