Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
Lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
But before they're safely in the southern sand
They gotta watch out for the critter called man
There's a goose and a gander and a goslin' child
Headin' on south at the call of the wild
Honk and holler as we go gonna see the Gulf of Mexico
Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou

Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
And the call of the wild is callin' me come home
I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississipp'
Honk and holler as we go...
Bayou bayou bayou bayou

Honk and holler as we go...

My pappy led this band of twenty-three and the second in command included me
He made one fatal slip and he flew too low the long tom's got him from the old bayou
Honk and holler as we go...
