To love you so and still not have you will destroy me in time
So I'm goin' away where nobody knows me and get you off of my mind
I've packed my things a dozen times but unpack is all I do
Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you

I made it to the edge of town and turned around
I made it to the bridge downtown by my nerve let me down
I tried to go but how can I leave when all roads lead to you
Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you

I made it to the edge of town and turned around
I made it to the bridge downtown by my nerve let me down
I tried to go but how can I leave when all roads lead to you
Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you
