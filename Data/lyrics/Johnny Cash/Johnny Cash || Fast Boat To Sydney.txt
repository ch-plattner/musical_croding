Oh I am a cheat and I'm a liar 
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire 
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny 
And while I'm home with the blues 
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo 
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney 

I said listen to me babe 
I gave up the lovin' trade 
I'm tired of all this runnin' jumpin' playin' 
But you're like it down under 
The world with the Australian girls 
And there's not a word of truth in what you're sayin' 

Oh I am a cheat and I'm a liar 
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire 
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny 
And while I'm home with the blues 
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo 
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney 

This is my greatest act 
I've come boom a rangin' back 
Grinnin' like a Rudolf Valentino 
But then you grab your travel load 
Like a swingin' grimmin' dog 
And hopped on that fast boat to Sydney 

Cause I am a cheat and I'm a liar 
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire 
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny 
And while I'm home with the blues 
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo 
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
