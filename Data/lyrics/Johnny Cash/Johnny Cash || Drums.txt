From the Indian reservation to the governmental school 
Well they're goin' to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule 
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed 
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name 
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear 
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near 
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs 
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed 
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right 
In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white 
And there are drums... 
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school 
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool 
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old 
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold 
And there are drums... 
Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull 
There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full 
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul 
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo 
And there are drums... 
Well you may teach me this land's hist'ry but we taught it to you first 
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed 
Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame 
In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame 
And there are drums...
