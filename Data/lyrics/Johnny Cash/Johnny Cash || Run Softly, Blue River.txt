(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep 
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine 
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time 
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife 
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life 
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too 
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Oh I thrill to her kisses... 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
