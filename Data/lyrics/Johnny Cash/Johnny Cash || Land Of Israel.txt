From the top of Sinai,
to the Sea of Galilee,
Every hill and plain is home,
Every place is dear to me.

There the breezes tell the stories,
Oh, what stories they do tell,
Of the mighty things that happened,
In the Land of Israel.

Here, where Moses and the prophets,
Spoke of One who would be king,
Of a Heavenly Messiah,
And the blessings He would bring.

Oh, to hear the call again,
"All is peaceful, all is well",
Upon every rock and mountain,
In the land of Israel.
