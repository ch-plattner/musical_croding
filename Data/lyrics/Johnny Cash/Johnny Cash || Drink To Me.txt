Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

A rose, a carnation, the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
(Drink to me, drink to me)
But only the orchid was worthy of you, so I threw all the others away
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals

And after a day or two
The flower still blooms but the scent's not the orchids
It carries the savor of you

Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

So if you're gonna drink to me, drink with your eyes
And I'll never cry for wine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
(Drink to me, drink to me)

'Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul
And honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me

Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me
