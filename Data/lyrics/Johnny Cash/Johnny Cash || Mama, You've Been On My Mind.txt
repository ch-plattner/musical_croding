
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I won't be next to you you know I won't be near
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
As the one that I've got on my mind mama you been on my mind

Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering
The crossroads that I'm at
And maybe it's the weather somethin' like that
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind

Well I don't need trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading I won't say I'll forget
And I won't pace a floor bout down and bent but yet
Mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind

Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
