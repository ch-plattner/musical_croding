
Sunshine and showers and everything comin' up daisies 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 
Driveins and picnics end every day was Saturday 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 

The whole wide world was jealous we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us 
Never did need any money everything was milk and honey 
Oh long walks by the river talkin' bout living together 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 

Long weeks of waitin' and livin' for the day we marry 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 
Happiness and laughter we found everything we were after 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 

The whole wide world was jealous we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us 
Never did need any money everything was milk and honey 
Oh long walks by the river talkin' bout living together 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had 
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
