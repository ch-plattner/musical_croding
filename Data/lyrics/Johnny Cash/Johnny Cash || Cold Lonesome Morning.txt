
One of these cold lonesome mornings, you're gonna kill me
I'm gonna lay there and I'm gonna die
You will soon give me pain enough to fill me
'Cause I'm gone past doin' any good to cry

And the warm sunshine is like a stranger
There's a cruel violation with the dawn
Lord, my pain can't stand illumination
And one of these cold lonesome mornings I'll be gone

One of these cold lonesome mornings, dark and early
Before a wild bird sings I'm gonna fly
While it's still dark and I'm still reachin' for you
I'll wake up and I can't cry

But I know my heart can't stand another tremor
Now it's holding together I don't know
But just before the dawning's first glimmer
One of these cold lonesome mornings I'm gonna go

Yes, one of these cold lonesome mornings you're gonna kill me
