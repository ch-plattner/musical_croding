Every eye shall see every ear shall hear the sound of angels
When He comes
When He comes
Every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that He is Lord
When He comes
When He comes

[Chorus:]
And He'll plant His Beautiful feet upon this mountain
And the dead of all the ages who believed on Him will rise
And I'll be one I'll be one in the first Resurrection
When He comes
When He comes
When He comes

Everyone then will know that it's Him, really Him the one and only
When He comes
When He comes
Glorified and transformed I'll arise at His call, I'll be ready
When He comes
When He comes

[Chorus:]
And He'll plant His Beautiful feet upon this mountain
And the dead of all the ages who believed on Him will rise
And I'll be one I'll be one in the first Resurrection
When He comes
When He comes
When He comes
