Better watch what you're doin' Henry you better take it easy sheriff
Somebody might be watchin' and the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you and the world's gonna fall on you
You can't slip around in this town Henry ev'rybody knows ev'rybody sheriff
Somebody's gonna tell somebody the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
You better look over your shoulder sheriff somebody might be watchin' Henry
You can't tell who's gonna see you the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
You can't slip around in this town ain't no doubt they'll find out
You better stop that better stop now you better not wait be too late
Now who do you think you're foolin' Henry ain't nobody here sleepin' sheriff
The whole world's watchin' and the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
You better watch what you're doin' Henry better take it easy sheriff
Somebody might be watchin' and the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you and the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
Better look over your shoulder sheriff somebody might be watchin' Henry
You can't tell who's gonna see the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
Now who do you think you're foolin' Henry ain't nobody here sleepin' sheriff
The whole world's watchin' and the world's gonna fall on you
And the world's gonna fall on you
