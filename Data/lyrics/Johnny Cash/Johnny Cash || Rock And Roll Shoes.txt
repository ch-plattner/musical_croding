
It seems like yesterday
I heard people say
Son you were born a stray, someday you'll settle down
I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
Right now I'm doing fine
Rollin' from town to town

I don't care where I ride
I'll my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Guitars and ringin' tones
Are in my blood and in my bones
Show me a bus and I'll call it home
I don't wanna change

I don't care where I ride
I'll my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Oh the lonely day
When they put me in my grave
There ain't a word you need to say just
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

So let that moulder run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for movin' on
I'll be back some day

I don't care where I ride
I'll my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
