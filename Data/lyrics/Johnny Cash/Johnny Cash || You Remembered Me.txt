You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)

I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times that I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring...
