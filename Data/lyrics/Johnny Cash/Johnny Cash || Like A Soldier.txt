With the twilight colors falling 
And the evening laying shadows 
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind 
As I feel my own heart beating out 
The simple joy of living 
I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling 
Was always out there calling 
And they said a hundred times I should have died 
But now my present miracle 
Is that you're here beside me 
So, I believe they were roads that I was meant to ride

Like a soldier getting over the war 
Like a young man getting over his crazy days 
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways 
Every day is better than before 
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There were nights I don't remember 
And there's pain that I've forgotten 
Other things I choose not to recall 
There are faces that come to me 
In my darkest secret memory 
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

In my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places 
There's not one that matters now, no matter who 
I'm just thankful for the journey 
And that I've survived the battles 
And that my spoils of victory are you
