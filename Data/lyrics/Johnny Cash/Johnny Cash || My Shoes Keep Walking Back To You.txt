I may say that I don't care, hold my up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
'Cause nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
