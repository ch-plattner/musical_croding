Well you come home ah' feeling
For the knob on the door
You better pick up your feet
You're gonna' fall on the floor
I keep on ah' telling you
I'll tell you some more
You better leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink cool H20

Well your eyes are baggy
And ah' bloodshot red
It's been a week or two
Since you've been in bed
You better pay attention
Now to what I said
You better leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink cool H20

Well now I'll forgive you
For your running 'round
If you just promise that
You've come unwound
I'll buy you anything
You want in town
If you'll leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink
Cool H2O
