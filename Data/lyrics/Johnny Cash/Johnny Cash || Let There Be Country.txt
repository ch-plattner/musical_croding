Tom T Hall is forty now and so is Bobby Bare
Willie Nelson's gettin' grey and Faron Young don't care
But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go

Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song

No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
Let there be country and let the country play

Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song

Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
Let there be country and keep the country green

Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song

Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
And he's gonna be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on

Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song

Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
