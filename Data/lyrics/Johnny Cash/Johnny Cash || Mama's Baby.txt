
She said that she just couldn't leave her mother
I met a girl in our town I tour all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this gonna be
I live with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Ask her if she would marry me

But she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me it's a going come back in a year
And so, the year past away, and then I try to win her hand again
She even pact her close, but wouldn't go

Cause she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Well I hang around till finally I asked her to marry me
Her mother says that it would be alright
We bought ourselfs a little home
And I finally got her all alone but she stays with her mother every night

Cause she's a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well she said that she just couldn't leave - her mother
