
In a cozy little restaurant for lovers
It seems so out of place for you and me
We used to play around under the covers
But now its just a place to watch TV

So love me like you used to
When our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through
You can love me again
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love

Maybe we could use a long vacation
But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each others inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

So love me like you used to
When our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through
You can love me again
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love

Well we used to sit and talk about forever
But now we hardly ever talk at all
We walked a lot of tight ropes together
We always caught each other when we fall

So love me like you used to
When our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through
You can love me again
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love

Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love
