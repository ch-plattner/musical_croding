On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then Hell call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever Ill share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
And exchange it some day for a crown
