
On the island of Jamaica
Quit a long long time ago
At rose hall plantation
Where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer
The mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear
To see a frown on Annie's face

Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall

Well if you should ever go to see the great house at rose hall
There's expensive chairs and china
And great paintings on the wall
They'll show you any sitting room
And the whipping post outside
But they won't let you see the room
Where Annie's husbands died

Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean Sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall
