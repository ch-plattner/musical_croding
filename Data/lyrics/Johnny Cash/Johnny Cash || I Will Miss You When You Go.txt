
I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know 
But I'll have a memory to keep you near 
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same 
I will miss a million things that make you dear 
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep 
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be 
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you 
My but I will surely miss you when you go 

Your lovely ways make you...
