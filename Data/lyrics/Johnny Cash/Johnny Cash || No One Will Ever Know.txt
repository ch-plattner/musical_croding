
No one will ever know my heart is breaking 
Although a million teardorps start to flow 
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling 
I'll love you but no one will ever know 

I'll tell them we grew tired of each other 
And that I was glad the day you set me free 
I'll even make believe I never loved you 
And no one will ever know the truth but me 

I'll tell them we grew tired of each other 
And that I was glad the day you set me free 
I'll even make believe I never loved you 
And no one will ever know the truth but me
