
Well I see you've lost your honey bee 
I know how you must be feeling now 
You feel sad sad but boy it ain't that bad 
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit 
And then you'll be all right 

Well you know it wasn't long ago 
Your honey bee was queen of my bee tree 
But then away she flew and took my honey to you 
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit 
And then you'll be all right 

I pity you 
I know what you're going through 
You watched your queen bee fly 
Your honeycomb went dry 
But if you keep pushin' on 
You won't care if she's gone 

You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit 
And then you'll be all right 
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit 
And then you'll be all right
