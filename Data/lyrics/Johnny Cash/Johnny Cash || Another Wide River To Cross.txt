
I've stood on the bank by the weeping willow,
With another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
With another wide river to cross.
I believe I can make it to the other side,
'Cos I feel a hand on me,
Helping me with another wide river to cross.

When I wake up to many a day,
With another wide river to cross.  
Another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
I jump right in the dark and I swim right on, toward the light on the other side.
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross.  

Oh the whirlpools twist and pull at me,
With another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
With another wide river to cross.
If I reach up a hand is always reaching down for me.
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross.

Well the river Jordan is a narrow stream,
But it's another wide river to cross.
It's another wide river to cross.
Another wide river to cross.
But I believe that there's a resting place that's provided just for me,
On the heaven's side of another wide river to cross.
