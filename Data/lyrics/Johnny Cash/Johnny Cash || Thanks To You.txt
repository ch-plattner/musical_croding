I sat at home on Friday last waitin' for your call
Thinkin' as the hours pass were you worth it all
As the tears begin to fill my head
It 's then I thought to write instead
Another hit song full of heartache thanks to you

Thanks to you I'm gettin' the applause
Thanks to you and all the pain you cause
Credit must go where credit is due
So I tip my hat and I toast to you
For all the hit songs full of heartache thanks to you

Days go by and weeks will pass with not a word from you
And I don't mind when people ask how's you know who
Cause when the tears begin to fill my head
It's then I start to write instead
Another hit song full of heartache thanks to you

Thanks to you I'm gettin' the applause...

Credit must go where credit is due
So I tip my hat and I toast to you
For all the hit songs full of heartache thanks to you
