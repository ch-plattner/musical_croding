Come and take me to the airport 
Come and bore me on that plane 
Cause I've got no expectations 
To ever pass this way again 

Well once I was a rich man but now I am so poor 
Never in my weary life have I felt like this before 
Your love is like a diamond and you cast your pearls to swine 
And as I see you leavin' me it drags my peace of mind 

Come and take me to the airport 
Come and bore me on that plane 
Cause I've got no expectations 
To ever pass this way again 

Your love is like the water 
It's sparking on the stone 
Your love is like the music 
First it's here and then it's gone 

Come and take me to the airport 
Come and bore me on that plane 
Cause I've got no expectations 
To ever pass this way again 

Come and take me to the airport 
Come and bore me on that plane 
Cause I've got no expectations 
To ever pass this way again
