
I'm the last of the babies of the World War 2
World War 2 and that's the one we didn't lose, I heard that
I was raised on biscuits, Spam and powdered eggs
DiMaggio's baseball and Marilyn's legs

And I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters, yeah

I remember when the great train, they used to run on coal
And they would run on coal and I would be ready to go, me too
Old white shirt and a tired overall
Sometime I think my daddy knew it all

And I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters, yeah

I remember Louisiana in a hot steamy night
Hot steamy night and she was holding me tight
An old red Chevy with a big back seat
I had me some two tall shoes off my feet

Okay, I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters, yeah

I'm a world war baby holding mama's hand
Mama's hand and how my daddy knew the land
Truck bearin' music and poverty and wealth
I got some great big scars on myself

Now I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters, yeah

I'm the last tie roller with the last good hand
Last good hand and I'm a gambling man
All them bombs and people wakin' on that boom
Sometimes I reckon I got here too soon

I'm the last of the drifters
I'm the last of the drifters, yeah
I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters
