
On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees

One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said, "Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees"

And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt

"On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains"

When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees
