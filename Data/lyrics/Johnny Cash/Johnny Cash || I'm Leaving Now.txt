Hold on honey I'd like to say I'm bustin' out and breakin' away
I'm lettin' you go like a hot horseshoe I can't take another heartache from you
Think about how it's gonna be when you start back to needin' me
When your dancin' shoes have lost their shine I'm gonna be gone in mine
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now
Get outta my face get outta my place I'm leavin' now
Adios I'm leavin' now

Yeah the time they come when you trim the fat
Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat
Bye bye baby when the bills come due
You might have to give up a jewel or two
Eat your heart out anyway it's hard as your head
And it's cold as clay
It's all over now you won't have me
Your sugar daddy or your money tree
I'm leavin' now yeah I'm leavin' now
Get outta my space get outta my face
I'm leavin' now hey I'm leavin' now

Pull up the collar on my travelin' coat
Sell that miserable pleasure boat
I wouldn't give a nickel for another buck
I'm livin' on muscle guts and luck
If anybody asks where did I go
Tell'em I went where the wild goose go
They won't even have me an area code
Don't have a number don't need a row
I'm leavin' now (me too) I'm leavin' now
Get outta my face get outta my space
Leavin' now adios I'm leavin' now

I'm leavin' now
