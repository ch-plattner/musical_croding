
Hold on honey I'd like to say
I'm busting out and breaking away
I'm letting you go like a hot horse shoe
I can't take another heart ache from you

Think about how it's gonna be
When you start back to needing me
When your dancing shoes have lost their shine
I'm gonna be gone in mine

I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
Get out of my face
Get out of my place
I'm leaving now, adios
I'm leaving now

And the time it comes when you trim the fat
Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat
Bye bye baby when the bills come due
You might have to give up a jewel or two

Eat your heart out anyway
It's hard as your head and it's cold as clay
It's all over now you won't have me
Your sugar daddy or your money tree

I'm leaving now yeah
I'm leaving now
Get out of my space
Get out of my face
I'm leaving now, hey hey
I'm leaving now

Pull up the collar on my traveling coat
Sell that miserable pleasure boat
I wouldn't give another nickel for another buck
I'm living on muscle, guts, and luck

If anybody asks where did I go
Tell 'em I went where the wild goose goes
I wouldn't have me an area code
Don't have a number, don't need a row

I'm leaving now, me to
I'm leaving now
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
I'm leaving now, adios
I'm leaving now

I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
Get out of my space
Get out of my face
I'm leaving now, adios
I'm leaving now
