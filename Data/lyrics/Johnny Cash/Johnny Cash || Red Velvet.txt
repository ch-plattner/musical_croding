
Four months ago in April a day-coach she came down 
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow 
Should have known I couldn't hold her livin' out so far from town 
And the nights to come are long and slow to go 

If I had known before we kissed 
You can't keep red velvet on a bordered farm like this 
Well now she's up and left me she went a walkin' down the line 
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow 
All dressed up in red velvet and her high-heel shoes so fine 
And the nights to come are long and slow to go 

Well I sit and count December stars while they dance around 
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow 
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll ride on into town 
And the nights to come are long and slow to go 

If I had known before we kissed 
You can't keep red velvet on a bordered farm like this 
Well now she's up and left me she went a walkin' down the line 
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow 
All dressed up in red velvet and her high-heel shoes so fine 
And the nights to come are long and slow to go
