On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for awhile
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
And I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

There's eternity before me
Just beyond the dark'ning veil
O my spirit hungers to go on
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
And I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
(fading out)I will take...
