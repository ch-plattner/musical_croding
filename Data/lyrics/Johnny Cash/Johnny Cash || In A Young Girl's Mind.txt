Hand me my guitar there's a song that I was singing
Back when I was young and I had a good time
Looking for love in the misty waters of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind

Only in shadows and lonely at night she turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her abuse her and you know it ain't right to treat one who loves you so badly
When she's doing the best that she can you know she's doing the best that she can

Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
You don't have to worry cause there's a bright tomorrow
In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows
So hand me my guitar
Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
