I hear people laughing on the corner by the square 
The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there 
I've been in here a listening for your footsteps down the hall 
And I'll be waiting for you after the ball 

After the ball is over, after the ball 
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall 
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall 
I'll be waiting for you after the ball. 

Loving you is a sweet addiction I need only you 
Just as long as you come back we'll do what you want to 
Give the night your laughter, but I'll have you after all. 
I'll be waiting for you after the ball 

After the ball is over, after the ball 
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall 
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall 
I'll be waiting for you after the ball.
