We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, Mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me

She always got me out of bed early Sunday morn'
And took me out to church where I could learn about Lord
Mama tried to tell me how my life was gonna be
But I was young and wild, and it was hard for me to see

Dear Mama, now that we're older
We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, Mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me

[SPOKEN:]
(Mama, you always taught me right from wrong when I was growin' up
And it's a pity that most people like me have to try everything for
themselves
I realize now that you always knew just what you were talkin' about
And mama for all that hard work you did
And for the sacrifices you made for us
I just wanna say, thanks a lot)

Dear Mama, now that we are older
We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, Mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me
Mama, you mean a lot to me
