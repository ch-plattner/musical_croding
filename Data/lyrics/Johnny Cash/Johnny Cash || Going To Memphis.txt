
Bring a drink of water Leroy
Bring a drink of water, no
If I could get to the mercy man
He'd give me some I know

I got a gal in Vicksburg
Bertha is her name
Wish I's tied to Bertha
Instead of this ball and chain

I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, yeah

A dude took all my money
Wouldn't let me see the cards
I owe the boss about a hundred years
For sleepin' in his backyard

I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
Yeah I'm goin' to Memphis

Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone

I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis

I never been to Chicago
But it must be a mighty fine place, that's right
I couldn't get past Tennessee
With Mississippi all over my face

I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, Memphis

Well, the freezin' ground at night
Is my own foldin' bed
Pork salad is my bread and meat
And it will be till I'm dead

Well, I brought me a little water
In a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the boss man caught me drinkin' it
And I believe, he broke my hand

They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for a deed I did
But I dis remember what, yeah

Well another boy is down
The shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body
To see what the shoutin's about

I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah I'm goin' to Memphis

Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone

I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
