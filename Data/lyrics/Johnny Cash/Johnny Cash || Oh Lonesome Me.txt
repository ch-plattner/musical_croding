Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me oh lonesome me

Well I'll bet she's not like me...
Oh lonesome me
