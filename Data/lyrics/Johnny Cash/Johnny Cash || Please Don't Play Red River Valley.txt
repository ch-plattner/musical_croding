
Well I see you got yourself a brand new harmonica
Mail ordered from the Steagal's catalogue
Boy I hope you can learn to play it like Lonnie Glossom
And while you added you to oughta learn a verse or two
Of Red River Valley Oh My Darling Clementine or Salty Dog
Oh but please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day and see
You know the only song I ever learned to play on my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica
That I got from Wayne Raney in Clint Texas
C-L-I-N-T Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Then she said farewell to my french harp and me

Well I see you're doin' pretty good on your new harmonica
But don't you think you oughta learn about one more tune you know
See you hold it like you's gonna eat a handful of popcorn
And sometime you suck in and sometimes you blow
But friend now please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day
Like I said the only song I ever learnd
On my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica that I got from Clint Texas
From Wayne Raney in Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Oh then she said farewell to my french harp and me
