
Last Saturday night I got married me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted gonna take another stroll downtown

Irene goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene Goodnight Irene I'll see you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a fool notion to jump in the river and drown

Irene goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene Goodnight Irene I'll see you in my dreams

Stop your ramblin' stop your gamblin' stop stayin' out late at night
Go home to your wife and family stay there by the fireside bright

Irene goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene Goodnight Irene I'll see you in my dreams
