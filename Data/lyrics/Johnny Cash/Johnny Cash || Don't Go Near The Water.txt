
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
Honey do your remember?
You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
Then your mama calling don't be late
And I'd hear your daddy holler "Son she's my only daughter"
You'd stick your nose in the honeysuckle down by the gate
I could still hear your mama calling "don't go near the water"

We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water

We'd hear the rocking chair squeaking
As you sneaked up the back stairs
Mama waiting like a grizzly bear
Had to get the honeysuckle out of your hair
But in the morning light
You'd look her right in the eye
It wasn't a lie
We didn't go near the water

We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water

Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
She should've worried about me

'Cause we were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water yeah
