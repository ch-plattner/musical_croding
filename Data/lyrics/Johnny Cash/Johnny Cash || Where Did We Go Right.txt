
In a world where everybody's fallin' apart
One by one, heart by heart
You and I stay together and we never even try
Side by side in a world turned upside down

Our love keeps spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?

At a time when all the world is searchin' for truth
His love for you will even prove
And what we have is what everybody's tryin' to find
Peace of mind in a world turned upside down

Our love keeps spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?

So many wrongs, so many lovers
I wish they all could know
What we've found in one another

In a world turned upside down
Our love keep spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?
