This is the 23rd of April no May, 23rd of May and John and I are 
sitting on the veranda of a hotel that is in Tiberias Israel 
It is right on the Sea of Galilee 
We can see to our left the place where they held the Sermon On The Mount 
And across the lake is now the land of Israel 
But up until eleven months ago was held by Syria 
On down to the right further down the Jordan River joins the Sea if Galilee 
And it's a beautiful day with the birds 
You can hear the motor boats on the lake only one that I can see 
And then a big pleasure boat that is coming across the other side 
from the Sea of Galilee 
The lake at this point I'd say is about eight miles wide and it's fourteen miles long 

Hmm that's right June Israel is really again in its glory 
This is a beautiful place 
It's in much greater glory that she was in the days of King Herod 
I'm proud to say for the Jews today King Herod gained the throne like a fox 
Ruled like a lion and died like a dog
