It's not always the land that's the hardest and bitterest 
It's the man who has the hard bitter attitude 
Toward his fellow man or toward the land 
Such is the case that you will find in this following song 
About a man's attitude toward his fellow man and toward this land 

I walked in the big yard to feel the warm sunshine 
A ninety-nine year man stepped over to me 
He offered a smoke and he said as I rolled it 
Tomorrow I'm going to break out and go free 

They watch us by sunlight they watch us by spotlight 
But I know a way for a man to go free 
Down under my cell I'm diggin' a tunnel 
The walls of a prison will never hold me 

I told him that I'd have no part of his scheming 
My time would be over one year from today 
His eyes blazed with fire and he looked right through me 
Bitter but broken again he did say 

They watch us by sunlight... 

Next morning at breakfast the old man was missing 
Then we all heard the rifles high up on the wall 
He'd gone through the tunnel just like he had promised 
And they said he was crying when they saw him fall 

They watch us by sunlight...
