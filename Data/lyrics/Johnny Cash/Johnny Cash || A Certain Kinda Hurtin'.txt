
I've got a certain kind of hurtin' since you've gone
I've got a pain I can't explain and it keeps on hanging on
You were gone on morning and I held on tight
But I went all to pieces later on that night
I've got a certain kind of hurtin' since you've gone

I've got a tear that's very near to showin' through
I get to week to speak when I think of losin' you
You never got out of sight till I knew
That nothin's gonna ever be right without you
I've got a certain kind of hurtin' since you've gone

I've got a lonely heart that only beats for you
I hope you'll find I'm on your mind needin' me like I need you
You're not leavin' on a one way track
'Cause I'm gonna come get you and I'm bringin' you back
I've got a certain kind of hurtin' since you've gone
