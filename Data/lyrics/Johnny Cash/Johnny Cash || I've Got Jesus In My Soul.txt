
I’ve got Jesus in my soul
It’s the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
I’ve got Jesus in my soul

I was lifted one night by God’s blinding light
And it shook me right out of my sleep
As His love entered in it washed away my sin
And I praise Him down on my knees

I’ve got Jesus in my soul
It’s the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
I’ve got Jesus in my soul

Even though as a sinner I was no beginner
And I’m glad that I never made the grave
Yes I’m thankful everyday for the prayers that were made
They were answered and my soul was saved

I’ve got Jesus in my soul
It’s the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
I’ve got Jesus in my soul

I was lifted one night by God’s blinding light
And it shook me right out of my sleep
As His love entered in it washed away my sin
And I praise Him down on my knees
