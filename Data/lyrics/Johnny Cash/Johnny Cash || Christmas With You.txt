The times that I've seen Christmas come and go are now two score
I wish you a merry Christmas and I wish you a many more
It's good to see the children laugh with joy the way they do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas is a sweet memory
Except for all the Christmasses that you weren't there with me
But now I really feel the spirit cause I love you like I do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you

I remember Christmas when I little could afford
And I try to remember it's the birthday of our Lord
Well I'll not forget to thank him for his blessing's on me too
And that I can spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas...
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you
