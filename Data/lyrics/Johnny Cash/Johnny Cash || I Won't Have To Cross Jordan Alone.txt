
When I come to the river at the ending of day 
When the last winds of sorrow have blown 
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone 
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone 

Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad 
When it seems that my friends have all flon 
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan... 

Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep 
Christ the Saviour will care for his own 
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan...
