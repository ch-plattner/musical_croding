
I know that you're wondering who I dream about 
And if I've met someone who thrills me so 
Well I finally met a girl who turns me inside out 
I'll tell you about her for you ought to know 

You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right 
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night 

When she's around me sometimes I can hardly speak 
I stammer and I act just like a fool 
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak 
You know her honey don't you know it's you 

You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right 
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night
