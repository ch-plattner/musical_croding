He slowly raised the trembling hand
Gently brushed the silver strand of hair from his wrinkled brow
Lips that used to talk so free the eyes that used to beckon me were silent now
He listens to a passin' train gives into an old familiar pain familiar pain
They retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
His woman's name was Margaret
He loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
He called this train the Diplomat she's the only other lady that he ever loved
Some forty years he made the steam
From Memphis down to New Orleans but now he's off the line
And the closest that he ever gets Margaret or the Diplomat is in his mind
He siad take me to the station the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
Can't you hear that whistle blowing they both know I've been alone for much too long
Let's not keep 'em waitin' we'll talk about the good times later on
Right now take me to the station the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home

They say he talks crazy when
He sees the passin' train or when he hears Margaret's name
But the only things he ever loved he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
So who's to say he's right or wrong
Reachin' out and hangin' on to dreams he can't let go
He threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs
He siad take me to the station...
They retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold
And took daddy's train
