
It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job but Lord he's found a gun

He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
That he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel that great relief

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

The evening news carries all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries we'll never live this down

Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

And fly like eagles out among the stars
