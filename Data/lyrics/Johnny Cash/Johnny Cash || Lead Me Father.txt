
When my hands are tired and my step is slow
Walk beside me and give me the strength to go
Fill my face with Your courage, so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble, so the world won't know

Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along

When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand, strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like You wanted to be

Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along
