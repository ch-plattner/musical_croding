Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell

But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
