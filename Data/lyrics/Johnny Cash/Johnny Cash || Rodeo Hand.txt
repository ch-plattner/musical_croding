
He's a rodeo hand a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now most athletes take alfalfa pills and super B's 
A cowboy don't need all that motern stuff
A cowboy's gotta be lean and mean he trains on caffine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to make him tough

He's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Some where between the crazy and insane
Cowboys ain't afraid pf dyin' shoot he'd even ride a red eyed Lion
If you'd show him where to take the rein
Now the only coach a cowboy needs is a growlin' gut that says come on let's eat
So tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride
Bout the only thing that makes him go
Is that big gold buckle waitin' down the road
And a bad case of too much cowboy pride
