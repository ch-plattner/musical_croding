Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowin'
All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
And then he'll come back in the evening
And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true

This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday

Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by
One day is like the other and every time he prays he prays to die
He's been there for so long now he wouldn't know how to talk to men outside
And though it's the life he lives for he fears the day the gates swing open wide

This is the life of a prisoner...
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday
