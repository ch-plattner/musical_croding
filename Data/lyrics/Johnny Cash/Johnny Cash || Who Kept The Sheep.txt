
The shepherds afar left their flocks by night
Followed the new star by its heavenly light
Did the lambs fear the wolves
Did they lay down and sleep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep

Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light
That the shepherds had followed night after night
Did they not stray
Did little lambs weep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep

Under the new star, the new Saviour lay in his dim manger
He lay on the hay
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep
But who kept the sheep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
