Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail

Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail...

He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
City jail city jail...

Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall

City jail city jail...

Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry

City jail city jail...
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening
