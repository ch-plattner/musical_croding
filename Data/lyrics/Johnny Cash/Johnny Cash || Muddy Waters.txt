Old frame house she can't take no more beatin' ain't no use to stay and make a stand
Well the morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things they say you just can't take 'em with you
The flood will swallow all you leave behind
Won't be back to start all over cause what I've held before is gone
Mary take the child the river's risin' muddy water taking back my home

The road is gone there's just one way to leave here
Turn my back on what I've left below
Shiftin' lands broken farms around me muddy water's changin' all I know
Hard to say just what I'm losin' ain't never felt so all alone
Mary take the child the river's risin' muddy water taking back my home

Won't be back to start...
That muddy water taking back my home
Muddy water's taking back my home muddy water taking back my home
