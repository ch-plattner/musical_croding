
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more 
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair 
When the saved diverse shall gather over on the other shore 
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there 
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder 
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there 

Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun 
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care 
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done 
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there 
When the roll is called up yonder... 
(When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)
