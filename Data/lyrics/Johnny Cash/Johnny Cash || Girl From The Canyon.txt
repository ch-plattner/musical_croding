The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home
As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own
Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain
Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane

These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand
Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land
I'm hopin' to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead
The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead

The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I done
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the mornin' brought the sun
The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one

An outlaw is a hunted one with a price upon his head
We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said
And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride
The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side

The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I done...
She was the only one
