By a Boa Constrictor by a Boa Constrictor
I'm getting swallowed by a Boa Constrictor and I don't like snakes one bit
What do you know he's swallowed my toe oh gee he's up to my knee
Oh my he's up to my thigh oh yummy he's up to my tummy
Oh fiddle he's up to my middle oh glum he's mashing my lungs
Now look here snake I don't look good with this long tail on me
It's all about I can say sneak except give me a break sneak
My torso's cold and it's startin' to mould Boa Constrictor how much can you hold
Oh yes he's up to my chest oh heck he's up to my neck
Nearly all in he's up to my chin oh dread he's swallowed my...excuse me
