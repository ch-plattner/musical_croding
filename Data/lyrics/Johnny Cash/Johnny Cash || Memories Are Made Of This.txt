
Take one fresh and tender kiss 
Add one stolen night of bliss 
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy 
Memories are made of this.

Don't forget a small moonbeam 
Fold it lightly with a dream 
Your lips and mine to sip the wine 
Memories are made of this

Then at the wedding bells 
One house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor 
Stir carefully through the day 
See how the flavor stays 
These are the dreams that we must savor

With His blessings from above 
Serve it generously with love 
One man, one wife, one love for life 
Memories are made of this
