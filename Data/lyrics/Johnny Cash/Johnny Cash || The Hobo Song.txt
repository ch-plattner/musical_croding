
There was a time when lonely men would wander
Through this land rolling aimlessly along
So many times I've heard of their sad story
Written in the words of dead men's song
Down through the years many men have yearned for freedom
Some found it only on the open road
So many tears of blood have fell around us
Cause you can't always do what you were told.

Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to.
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad tracks
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal travelin' sack

Last Sunday night I wrote a letter to my loved one
I signed my name and I knew that I stayed away way too long
There was a time when my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing this hobo song

Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad tracks
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal travelin' sack

Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad tracks
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal travelin' sack
