
So you're feeling numb about me being gone
So you see now you're half alive when you're alone
Well I just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait
You gave me love but too little too late

Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late

So you got plans about some fine affair
Well think about it a little while while you're lying there
Love long and hard and don't make your lover wait
You gave me love but too little too late

Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late

You gave me love but too little too late
