Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Back in the saddle again

My little boy said, "Daddy, who's Gene Autry?"
His old movie was comin' on TV
And I said, "Let me tell you about him, son"
And I took him upon my knee

"Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright"

"I'd be right downtown at the picture show
Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good"

Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again"

"Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was ridin' right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine"

"And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot"

"Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me"

Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again"

"And you know the way
He rescued the rancher's daughter
He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home
With a good victorious smile"

"Now you ask me, 'Who's Gene Autry?'
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him
Like I did forty years ago"

Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again"
