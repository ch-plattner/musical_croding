
Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine 
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine 
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul 
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal 
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few 
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines 
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine 
Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day 
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded) 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine 
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll 
That my body would blacken and turn into coal 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones 
Where it's dark as a dungeon...
