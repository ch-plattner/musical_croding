He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
Well she started in to spend my money
She started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town

We're in the jailhouse now
We're in the jailhouse now
They told us once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
We're in the jailhouse now
