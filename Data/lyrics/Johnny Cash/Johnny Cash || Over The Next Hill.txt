
By the way the land is layin'
I think I'd be safe in sayin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we'll be home

From the prophets I've been hearin'
I would say the end is nearin'
For I see familiar landmarks all along

By the dreams that I've been dreamin'
There will come a great redeemin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

By the turn the tide is takin'
I would say there's no mistakin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

There's a place that we are nearin'
That so many have been fearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

When we get there we're all hopin'
That we'll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the comin' storm

For the way's been long and weary
But at last the end is nearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home
