I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down brush my teeth
Shine up slick up dress up neat
Get everything looking just right

'Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there lookin' my best

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand

If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise
