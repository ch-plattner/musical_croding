
I've been up and down and out and I have been around
And I felt good more times than I felt bad
Lovin' you felt better than I've never known before
Losin' you's worst things that I've had

But it comes and goes
It's like a blue wind blows
Yes it goes and comes
But now I'm livin' some

And today my high didn't get any lower
And my low didn't fall anymore
But sometimes when I drop my guard
Everybody knows

Cause I can't control my feeling
And there ain't much sign of healing
Cause when the pain is there it always shows
But it comes and goes

In my mind I'm holding you and loving you again
I hear you laugh and the feel you cling to me
Although it's over I'm still holding on a little bit
And there's a lotta pain in the memories

But it comes and goes
It's like a blue wind blows
Yes it goes and comes
But now I'm livin' some
