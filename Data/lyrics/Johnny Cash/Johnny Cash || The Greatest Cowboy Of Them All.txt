I have always had my heroes I've loved a lot of legends
Many men in my mind are ridin' tall
But my cowboy hero hats off to the man who rode a donkey
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
He loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
And he'll lift up any maverick that falls
He sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise
He'll call up all the riders in the sky
I gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
That winds up where old cowboys never die
The trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
And he rides point for all the great and small
He will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset...
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
