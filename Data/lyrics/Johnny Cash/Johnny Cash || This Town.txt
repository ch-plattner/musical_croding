This Town
This town is not for me,
I won't be stayin' 'round.
This town is hard and cold;
I'm not happy in this town.
I'll pick up my heart and I'll go,
Where to I don't care or know.
Don't matter where I'll be found,
As long as I leave this town.
This town wants me to go,
It ain't where I was bound.
This town don't need me here,
I don't need this town.
To morrow who'll remember my name;
To morrow who'll remember I came.
Don't care which road I'll go down,
As long as it's a way from this town.
