She knew that Cody was the man she wanted
But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife

(Don't you worry)
Clementine

Cody saddled up and left his darlin'
Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told 'em this would be his last carousing'
"I'm gonna settle down boys if I can"

(With my darlin')
Clementine

Someone said, "It must have been past midnight
When Cody had to face a jealous man "
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan

(Don't you tell)
Clementine

We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lyin' on his face

(Softly callin')
Clementine

So buddies, make a monument to lay down at his head
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind
Mother, help your daughter put her weddin' dress away
'Cause Cody won't be ridin' back this time

(To his darlin')
Clementine
