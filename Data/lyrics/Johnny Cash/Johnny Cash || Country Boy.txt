Country boy, ain't got no shoes.
Country boy, ain't got no blues.
Well, you work all day
While you're wantin' to play
In the sun and the sand,
With a face that's tan.
At the end of the day,
When your work is done,
You ain't got nothin' but fun.

Country boy, ain't got no ills.
Country boy, don't owe no bills.

Country boy, ain't got no ills.
Country boy, don't owe no bills.
You get a wiggly worm,
And then you watch him squirm.
While you put him on a hook,
And you drop him in a brook.
If everything's gonna turn out right,
You're gonna fry fish tonight.

Country boy, got a lot to lose.
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes.

[Instrumental break]

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog.
Country boy, up a holler log.
Well, he comes in a run,
When you pick up your gun.
And with a shell or two,
And your dog and you,
When you get your rabbit,
You'll skin his hide,
He's gonna be good fried.

Country boy, you got a lot to lose.
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes.

[Instrumental break]

Country boy, you got work to do.
Country boy, in the morning dew,
You gotta plant the seed,
You gotta cut the weeds.
There's many a row,
You know you gotta hoe
When it's quittin' time,
And your work is through.
There's a lot of life in you

Country boy, you lucky thing.
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you were me.
