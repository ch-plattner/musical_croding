
I'm feelin' a little restless James
Warm up my limousine take me to the top of some ole mountain
And let me out
Aw I'll be alright it's just that things got tough on Easy Street tonight
It's hard on Easy Street some time blue on Easy Street some days
I thought our place in the sun was made in the shade
But it ain't no bed of roses up on Easy Street these days
Don't worry 'bout the gold my heart's not that cold
I'm only takin' two things when I leave
One life so I can live it
One love so I can give it where I please
It's hard on Easy Street some time blue on Easy Street some days
I thought our place in the sun was made in the shade
But it ain't no bed of roses up on Easy Street these days
