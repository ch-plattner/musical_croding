A ship came in, but it was empty;
And then it sailed back out to sea again.
Now there's the sail on the horizon,
And now I wait until your ship comes in.

And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts,
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea.
Prayin' that my ship of love will come 
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be.

I'll brave the storm until you're with me,
Cause wind and rain can't change a love that's true.
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you.

Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts,
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea.
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be.
