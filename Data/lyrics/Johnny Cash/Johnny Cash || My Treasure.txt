I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold 
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold 
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through 
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you 

My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above 
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love 

If I had my life before me if I could see it all 
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall 
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do 
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you 

My treasure unmeasured unmeasured...
