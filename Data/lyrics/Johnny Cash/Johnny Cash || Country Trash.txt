
I got a crib full of corn and a turnin' plow,
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now.
Got a cultivator and a doubletree,[1]
A leather line for the haw and gee.[2]
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash,
I'm doin' alright for country trash.

I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day,
I got about a dollar laid away.
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good,
Got a potbelly stove a cord* of wood.
Mama turns the left-overs into hash,
I'm doin' alright for country trash.

I got a mackinaw[3] and a huntin' dog.
A cap I ordered from the catalog.
A big tall tree that shades the yard,
A big fat sow for the winter's lard.
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash,
I'm doin' alright for country trash.

Well there's not much new ground left to plow,
And crops need fertilizin' now.
My hands don't earn me too much gold,
For security when I grow old.
But we'll all be equal under the grass,
And God's got a heaven for country trash.
And God's got a heaven for country trash.
I'll be doin' alright for country trash.

[A doubletree is a crossbar on a wagon or carriage to which two whiffletrees are attached for harnessing two animals abreast.]
[When training animals, such as horses or oxen, the command to turn left is "haw" and the command to turn right is "gee."]
[A mackinaw is type of jacket.]
[Firewood is measured in cords. One cord, also commonly called a full cord, is defined as 128 cubic feet, corresponding to a woodpile 4 feet wide × 4 feet high × 8 feet long.]
