A way out on the mountain near the sky
Hiding from the cold realities of life
Shaking that old road dust off my heels
I give my heart and mind a chance to heal

Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

A raccoon stole my minnows in the night
Thought I appreciate his need and his appetite
But unlike me he doesn't have to roam
And it's true that man can't live on bread alone

Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

It feels so good to have a simple wish
Where life and death is me and some old fish
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand
And surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand

Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
