Without love I am half human without love I'm all machine
Without love there's nothing doin' I will die without love
Without love I am an island all by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love there's no denyin' I am dyin' without love
For there is nowhere I can run and there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb by that gloomy look upon my face
Without love I'm incomplete without love I am not whole
Without love I'm barely on my feet I am dyin' without love

For there is nowhere I can run...
I am dyin' without love
