[Chorus] 
I never picked cotton 
But my mother did 
And my brother did 
And my sister did 
And my daddy died young 
Workin' in the coal mine

When I was just a baby 
Too little for a cotton sack 
I played in the dirt 
While the others worked 
'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs 
I made myself a promise 
When I was big enough to run 
That I'd never stay a single day 
In that Oklahoma sun

[Chorus] 
Folks said I grew up early 
And that the farm couldn't hold me then so 
I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck 
And I never went back again 
Then it was fast cars and whiskey 
Long haired girls and fun 
I had everything that money could bring 
And I took it all with a gun

[Chorus] 
It was Saturday night in Memphis 
When a redneck grabbed my shirt
When he said go back to your cotton sack 
I left him dying in the dirt 
They'll take me in the morning 
To the gallos just outside 
And in the time I got 
There ain't a hell of alot 
That I can look back on with pride

[Chorus]
