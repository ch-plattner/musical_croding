On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie. 

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land. 

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away. 

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land. 

No chilling winds or poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are felt and feared no more. 

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land. 

When I shall reach that happy place,
I'll be forever blessed,
For I shall see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest.
