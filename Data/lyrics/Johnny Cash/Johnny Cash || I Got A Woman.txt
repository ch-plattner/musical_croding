I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah
I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah
Well she's my baby when I'm in need oh she's a real too friend indeed
I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah
I save my loving early in the morning just for you oh yeah
I save my loving early in the morning just for you oh yeah
You're my big man don't you understand
And I love you you're my loving big big man
I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah

He's there to love me both day and night
Never grumbles and fusses just treats me right
Never walking in the streets leave me alone
She knows the woman places right there out in our home
I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah
I got a woman way cross town good to me oh yeah

Well she's my baby don't you understand and I'm her loving man
I got a woman way cross town she's good to me oh yeah
Got me a big man way cross town he's good to me oh yeah
Got me a big man way cross town he's good to me oh yeah
He's my baby don't you understand he's my loving big big man
I got a woman way across town she's good to me oh yeah
