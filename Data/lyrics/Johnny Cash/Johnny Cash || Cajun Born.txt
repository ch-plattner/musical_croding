My daddy was a Cajun man and he taught me how to plow
I remember mama's breakfast goosh-goosh in the caye
Steam syrup upon the banje I wish I had me some now
I'm a Cajun born I'm a Cajun bred and when I die I'll be Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio my soul will find it's way back to the bayou

Went to church every Sunday had a French talkin' preacher man
We kids joked about the preacher man cause we thought he wore a dress
After church we had a party Cajun music on the phonograph
Harry Short singing Jole Blon made a singer out of me
I'm a Cajun born...

When I get enough to marry get myself a Cajun lady
Somethin' sorta like my mama cause I ain't no other no other kind
And wherever fortune takes me with the breaks or makes me
Memory won't forsake me got Louisiana on my mind
I'm a Cajun born...
