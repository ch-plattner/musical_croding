
I have seen your colors woven in your blankets
I have heard your names on rivers and on towns
I have seen your turqoise on fine fancy ladies
And the indian sun is rising instead of going down

Navajo, navajo
The people call the people from ten thousand years ago
Navajo, navajo
From the land of the enchantment navajo

I have seen your redrock canyons out of gallop
I have walked upon your arizona hills
At crownpoint I watched an artists painting
All the secrets of your past surviving still

Navajo, navajoo
The people call the people from ten thousand years ago
Navajo, navajoo
From the land of the enchantment navajo

I have seen your women dress in royal purple
Silver from your hills upon their hands
I don't need a signpost reading reservation
To know the minute I'm on indian land

Navajo, navajoo
The people call the people from ten thousand years ago
Navajo, navajoo
From the land of the enchantment navajo

Navajo, navajoo
The people call the people from ten thousand years ago
Navajo, navajo
From the land of the enchantment navajo
