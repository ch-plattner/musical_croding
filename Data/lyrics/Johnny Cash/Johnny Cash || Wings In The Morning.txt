Wings in the morning and license to fly
Straight to the portals of never more die
Never more pain in them old aching bones
Wings in the morning to carry us home

My grandfather lived by the book all his life
On rich bottom land with twelve kids and a wife
He never saw TV, nor rode a jet plane
But he knew that heaven was holding his claim

The salt of the earth, yet with faith in the Lord
They all got together in that one accord
And what could be greater than God's guarantee
That we can have heaven for eternity?

Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
Lights getting low, so we don't see at all
But I promise you, on that getting up day
Wings in the morning, we'll fly away
