Hey hey sweet baby don't you think maybe we could find us a brand new recepie
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill and I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free if you wanna have fun come along with me
Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' somethin' up with me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady how's about savin' all your time for me
No more lookin' I know I've been tooken how's about keepin' steady company
I'm gonna throw my datebook over the fence find me one for five or ten cents
Keep it till it's covered with age cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
Say hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' somethin' up with me
