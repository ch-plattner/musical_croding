[Johnny Cash and June Carter:]
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands

[Johnny:]
My woman asks for little 
And nothing she demands
Except to hold these cotton pickin' hands

The bloom is white and then it's red
Then it falls to leave a bowl instead
The leaves fall and the field is white
We pick the pods from dawn to night

[Johnny and June:]
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands

[Johnny:]
My woman asks for little 
And nothing she demands
Except to hold these cotton pickin' hands

My woman cooks and sweeps the yard
And that old rug board is rough and hard
Her face is pretty though it's tanned
And I love those cotton pickin' hands

[Johnny and June:]
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands

[Johnny:]
My woman asks for little 
And nothing she demands
Except to hold these cotton pickin' hands

[Johnny and June:]
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton pickin' hands
I'm a fair to middling man And these are cotton pickin' hands
