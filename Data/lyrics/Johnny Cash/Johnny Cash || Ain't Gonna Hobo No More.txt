
Well here I am a hobo with my hobo's pots and pans
In an Alberta rail yard with my red-faced hobo friends
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more

So long BC Benning you have been a real good friend
And goodbye Boxcar Willie I guess I won't see you again
Here comes a train homebound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friend ain't gonna hobo no more

No one loves a hobo and I need some love
Yes I'm always so hungry and I never get enough
And no one wants a hobo hanging round their doors
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more

There's a man in Halifax that will give this bum a job
I'll use the money to find a woman I can love
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more

No one loves a hobo and I need some love...
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more
