
Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals, he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home

Why should we teary when Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies
Mercies for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home

Oh, for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinn'd, he has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
