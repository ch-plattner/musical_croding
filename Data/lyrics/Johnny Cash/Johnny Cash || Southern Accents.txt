
There's a southern accent,
Where I come from.
The young'uns call it country,
The Yankees call it dumb.
I got my own way of talkin',
But everything is done,
With a southern accent,
Where I come from.

Now that drunk-tank in Atlanta,
Was just a motel room to me.
Think I might go work Orlando,
If them orange groves don't freeze.
I've got my own way of workin',
But everything is run,
With a southern accent,
Where I come from.

For just a minute there I was dreaming.
For just a minute it was all so real.
For just a minute she was standing there,
With me.

There's a dream I that I keep havin',
Where my mama comes to me.
And she kneels down over by the window,
And says a prayer for me.
I got my own way of prayin',
And everyone's begun,
With a southern accent,
Where I come from.

[Instrumental break]

We have our own way of livin',
But everything is done,
With a southern accent,
Where I come from.
