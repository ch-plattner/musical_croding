[Johnny Cash:]
I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

[June Carter:]
I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

[Chorus:]
[Both:] Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
[Johnny:] Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
[Both:] Don't you think its come out time


[Johnny:] Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
[June:] Thank you for the flowers, now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand

[Chorus]
