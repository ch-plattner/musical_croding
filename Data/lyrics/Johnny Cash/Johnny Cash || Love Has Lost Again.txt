
I guess we're over and it's all been said before
But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
I can't remember when you and I began
It makes no difference cause love has lost again

If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
The price of giving I just don't understand
But it's collected and love has lost again

All that's left now is the closing of the door
It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again

It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again
