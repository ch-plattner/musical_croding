Cause one means only me and there's no you
But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true one and one makes two

Now let me show you what I mean
Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and you don't know what to do
Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one...

Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
And you look around and there's no one but you
Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one...

Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
Now everyone needs somebody to share with
To love and help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one...
I said it's true one and one makes two
