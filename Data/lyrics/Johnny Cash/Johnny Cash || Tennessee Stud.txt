
Back about eighteen and twenty-five 
I left Tennessee very much alive 
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud 
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud

Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa 
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw 
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Spud And 
I rode away on the Tennessee Stud 
On a Tennessee Stud 
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean 
The color of the sun and his eyes were green 
He had the nerve and he had the blood 
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud

Drifted on down into no man's land 
Across the river called the Rio Grande Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe 
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree 
We got in a fight over Tennessee Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud 
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud

The Tennessee Stud was long and lean 
The color of the sun and his eyes were green 
He had the nerve and he had the blood 
There was never a horse like the Tennessee Stud

I rode right back across Arkansas 
I whipped her brother and 
I whipped her Pa 
I found that girl with the golden hair 
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor 
Little horse colt playing round the door 
I loved the girl with the golden hair 
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

The Tennessee Stud was long and lean 
The color of the sun and his eyes were green 
He had the nerve and he had the blood 
There was never a horse like the Tennessee Stud
