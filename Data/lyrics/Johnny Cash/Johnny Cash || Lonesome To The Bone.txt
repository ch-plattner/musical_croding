
On the park bench I slept on
Raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me
I hear early mornin' motors
And I know the world is wakin' for the dawn

But my mind's down a dark alley
Somewhere where last night you loved me
And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone

I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone

Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone
