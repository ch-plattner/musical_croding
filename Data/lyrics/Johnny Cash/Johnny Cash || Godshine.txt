
Well a light from the sun comes shinin' 
Oh happy day oh happy day
And then along come a big old moon to light my way
And then the stars kinda twinkle and they light this path of mine 
And mine
I can't see a thing in his world without a little Godshine

Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high 
I need just a little bit of Godshine

Well Jesus died and there's a lot of folks feel regret
But on the other hand there are people that are laughin' yet
Laughin' about a man that lived and died divine
He could have lived on but he wouldn't stop spreadin' that Godshine

Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high 
I need just a little bit of Godshine

Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high 
I need just a little bit of Godshine

I'm in the dark when the sun is high I need just a little bit of Godshine
