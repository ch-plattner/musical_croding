She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place.
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run.
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none.

The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law.
She didn't know that I was poor, and lived outside the law.
Her daddy said I was a thief and didn't marry her for love.
But I was Susan's true belief, and I married her for love

I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run.
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none.

The house she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out.
She never stopped to think at all, that that's what I'm about.
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run.
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none.
