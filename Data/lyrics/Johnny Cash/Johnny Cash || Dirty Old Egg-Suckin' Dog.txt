Well he's not very handsome to look at 
Oh he's shaggy and he eats like a hog 
And he's always killin' my chickens 
That dirty old egg-suckin' dog 

Egg-suckin' dog 
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground 
If you don't stay out of my hen house 
You dirty old egg-suckin' hound 

Now if he don't stop eatin' my eggs up 
Though I'm not a real bad guy 
I'm gonna get my riffle and send him 
To that great chicken house in the sky 

Egg-suckin' dog 
You're always hangin' around 
But you'd better stay out of my hen house 
You dirty old egg-suckin' hound
