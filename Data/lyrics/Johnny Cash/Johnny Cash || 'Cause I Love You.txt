
I'll sweep out your chimney 
yes and, I will bring you flowers
yes and, I will do for you
Most anything you want me to

If we live in a cottage
You will feel like it's a castle
By the royal way you're treated
And attention shown to you

I'll be there beside you
If you need a cryin shoulder 
Yes, and I'll be there to listen
When you need to talk to me

When you wake up in the darkness
I will put my arms around you
And hold you till the mornin sun 
Comes shinin' through the trees

I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through

If we're ever parted 
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
'Cause I love you 

I will bring you honey
From the bee tree in the meadow
And the first time there's a rainbow
I'll bring you a pot of gold

I'll take all your troubles
And I'll throw 'em in the river
Then I'll bundle down beside you
And I'll keep you from the cold

I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through

If we're ever parted 
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
'Cause I love you
