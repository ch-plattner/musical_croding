Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leavin'
I said, "Shove off honey, baby, I ain't grievin'
Pack your bags and pull out this evenin'
There's a wide open road"

Early this mornin' you where nowhere about
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

There's a wide open road
It's leadin' south from my abode
If you stick around and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin' for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat was still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went down
That wide open road

If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

There's a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And there's a wide open road
