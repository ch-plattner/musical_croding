
We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
