
Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad?
When we're needin' bread and meat
Where we gonna get it, Dad?

We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill

Ploughin' time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we gonna make a livin'
With twenty acres to share?

I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill

I ain't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand-me-downs

I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill

Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills
If we all should die

We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky
