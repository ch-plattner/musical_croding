One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
I'm gonna ask him about his travelin'
And he will tell me about it all
One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul

I'm gonna tell him I read all his books
I'm gonna tell him I read all his books
And that is sure was hard to follow down the same road that he took
But I'm gonna tell him I read all his books

He'll introduce me to Luke and Timothy
He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy
I will be so glad to meet them and they will be glad to meet me
He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy

One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
(Talk to Paul)
One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to
Sit down and talk to Paul
I'm gonna meet his friends in Heaven
I'll be singin' with them all
One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul

One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand
One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand
That hand that raised up Uticus, that old sleepin', fallen man
One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand

I know just how he felt locked in that jail
I know just how he felt locked in that jail
And I bet that him and Silas will have quite a tale to tell
I know just how he felt locked in that jail

One of these days I'm gonna sit down and
Sit down and talk to Paul
One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to
Sit down and talk to Paul
I'm gonna ask him about his journeys
And he will tell me about them all
One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to
Sit down and talk to Paul
