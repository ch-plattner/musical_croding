
Christmas time's a-comin', Christmas time's a-comin'
Christmas time's a-comin' and I know I'm going home

Snowflakes are falling, my old home's a calling
Tall pines are humming, Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a-comin', Christmas time's a-comin'
Christmas time's a-comin' and I know I'm going home

Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for running, Christmas time's a-comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a-comin', Christmas time's a-comin'
Christmas time's a-comin' and I know I'm going home

White candles burning, my old heart's a yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a-comin', Christmas time's a-comin'
Christmas time's a-comin' and I know I'm going home
