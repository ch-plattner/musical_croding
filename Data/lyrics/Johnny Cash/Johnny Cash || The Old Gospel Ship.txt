
I'm gonna take a trip
In the old gospel ship;
I'm going far beyond the sky.
I'm gonna shout and sing,
Until heavens ring,
when I bidding this world goodbye.

If you are ashamed of me
You have no cause to be
for with Christ I am an Air
When my ship comes in
I will leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air

I am gonna take a trip
On the old gospel ship
I am going far beyond the sky
Oh I am gonna shout and sing
Until heavens ring
when I bid this world goodbye

Ohhh and if you look up toward the sky
you might see me passing by
there is no telling, no telling where I will be
and you will not have to wait no more
cause it is too for you I am on board
and they told me we all that is free
Ohhh I am gonna take a trip
On the old gospel ship
I am going far beyond the sky
And I shout and sing
Until heavens bring
when I bid this all world goodbye

the ship will make no stops
and on board there will be no cops
we are going far beyond the sky
hey we all jump up and down
and dance till that happy sound
let's bid this world goodbye

I am gonna take a trip
On the old gospel ship
I am going far beyond the sky, the sky
I am gonna shout and sing
Until heavens bring
when I bid this world goodbye, Goodbye

I am gonna take a trip
On the old gospel ship
I am going far beyond the sky
I am gonna shout and sing
Until heavens bring
when I bid this world goodbye
