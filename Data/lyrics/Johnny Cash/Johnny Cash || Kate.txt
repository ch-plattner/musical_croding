
Well I saw you with another
It made me lose my mind
Shot you with my '38
And now I'm doin' time
And you put me here
You put me here
Well there's no way to doubt
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

I've been tryin' to tell 'em
That I didn't do no wrong
Only gave you what you been
Deservin' all along
And you put me here
You put me here
There ain't no use denyin'
You done it with your lyin'
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Well the jury found me guilty
They wouldn't hear my plea
I listened as that judge said
Murder in the first degree
And you put me here
You put me here
Well there ain't no need to doubt
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Now the warden and the preacher
They're lettin' me go slow
It won't be long until I'm gone
Just thirteen steps to go
And you put me here
You put me here
There's just one way to figure
Your cheatin' pulled the trigger
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here
Well there ain't no need to doubt
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Kate, you just plain bad, you know that...
