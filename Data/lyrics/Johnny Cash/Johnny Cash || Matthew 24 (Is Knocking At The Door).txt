
I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
People getting ready for battle
And there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake
And the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today.

Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And there can't be too much more to come to pass.
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And a day or one more could be the last.

A great bear from the northland has risen from his sleep,
And the Army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep.
The young and old now prophesy a coming
Prince of Peace
And last night I dreamed of lightning in the east.

Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And there can't be too much more to come to pass.
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door,
And a day or one more could be the last.
