You've cut out your dancin' and you never see a show
Friends come by to pick you up and you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I walked by your house tonight and hoped that I might see
The guy who's got you in the spin I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreamin' of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses the times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you you're sittin' in the light
Missin' all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried...
You've got the ways of a woman in love
