
Hark the Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark the Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

Hail the Heaven born Prince of peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that Man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark the Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Hark the Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
