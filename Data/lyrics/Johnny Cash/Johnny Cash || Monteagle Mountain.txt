
There's a stretch of Highway on Interstate 24 between Nashville and Chattanooga 
That's claimed many trucker's life 
And your life is in your hands when you start down that long steep grade 
On Monteagle Mountain 

I just rolled out of Nashville in my big rig headin' south 
My eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth 
My whole body's achin' but I got to make them big wheels roll 
I got to be in Florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load 

I got to get passed Atlanta as soon as I can tonight 
I got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of Smoky's sight 
But there's one big thing standin' like a nightmare in my way 
I got to top Monteagle Mountain a little bit later today 

Goin' down Monteagle Mountain on I-24 
It's hell for a trucker when the devil's at your door 
He'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll 
Cause the mountain wants your rig and trucker I want your soul 

When I started down Monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold 
I knew I was in trouble and bout to lose control 
The runaway ramp was waitin' I saw the warnin' sign 
I said Lord help me make it have mercy on this soul of mine 

Well I ploughed into that runaway ramp and I could feel that big truck groan
My life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute I thought I was gone 
But when the smoke cleared I thanked God that I was still alive 
Cause when there's a runaway on Monteagle some truckers don't survive 

Goin' down Monteagle Mountain on I-24 
It's hell for a trucker when the devil's at your door 
He'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll 
Cause the mountain wants your rig and trucker I want your soul 

Yeah many a good man had lost his life on Monteagle Mountain it's a long steep grade 
Many a good hard workin' boy gone over the side watch out for Monteagle
