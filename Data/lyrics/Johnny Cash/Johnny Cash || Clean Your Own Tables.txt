And some too many truckers took her home
And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done I've said it's wrong

But I said clean your own tables boys and bring out your beer
Cause she ain't gonna do it this time
And drink to a use to be barmaid cause she's a lady I choose to be mine

And I ain't exactly been what you call your all American boy
I've done my time in Frisco in LA
How some of youth are taking pride in what I am
I heard you cussing this decision that I've made

But I said clean your own tables...

And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done well I say is wrong

But I said clean your own tables...
Boys if you're able clean your own tables and let me take care of mine
