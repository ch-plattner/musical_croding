And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and 
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone 
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone 
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you 
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through 
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands 
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands 
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray 
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say 
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command 
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand 
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be 
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me 
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill 
Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal 
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace 
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his 
Go and climb that mountain... 
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then 
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land 
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there 
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere 
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile 
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile 
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you 
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do 
Go and climb that mountain... 
Thou shalt have no Gods before me...
