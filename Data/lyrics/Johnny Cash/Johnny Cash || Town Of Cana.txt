
We are in the Town of Cana 
It is a short distance from Nazareth toward the Sea of Galilee 
And on his way to Capernaum Jesus stopped at a wedding feast 
Here which he was invited to 
And when he came to the feast he was told that the family was so poor 
That they didn't have wine for the wedding feast 
So Christ at this very spot that we are entering right now 
On which a church stands over 
Jesus ordered the jugs filled with water 
And then when they were served at the feast 
When the jugs were poured around to the different people 
It was wine of the finest wine that was known in Galilee at that time 
We are entering now down into a kind of a crypt-like place underneath the church 
Where the miracle actually took place 
And there is one of the jugs here 
That supposedly was one of those he used to pour the wine from that had been water 
And the well that the water was drawn from 
We are at the place where the water cintern was 
It is all undeground as most people lived back then under ground because it was cool 
This is where the water came from 
He turned the water into wine
