Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean 
He walked at his father's side 
Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around 
So many here had died 
The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground 
Not leaves like leaves from trees 
Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see 
From where come leaves like these 
Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise 
From where come such snow white leaves 
With such strange marks upon these squares 
Not even the wise owl could put them there 
So strange these snow white leaves 
His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned 
Crumbled the snow white leaves 
He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son 
The white men's talking leaves 
The white man takes a berry of black and red 
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed 
And he makes bird track marks 
And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away 
And his brother knows what's in his heart 
They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man 
The enemies can't hear them 
Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves 
Leave such things to them 
Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he 
If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee 
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place 
But he could not forget 
Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone 
The Cherokee alphabet 
Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light 
But he taught all who would believe 
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down 
Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves
