
Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch And as he reached his mother's grave I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down

Bring my darling boy to me Was his mother's dying plea And as he staggered through the gate A lassie came just one day too late

Three years have passed since she went away Her son is sleeping beside her today And I know that in heaven his mother he'll see For God has heard that drunkard's plea

Lord have mercy on me Was the kneeling drunkard's plea And as he knelt there on the ground I know that God in heaven looked down
