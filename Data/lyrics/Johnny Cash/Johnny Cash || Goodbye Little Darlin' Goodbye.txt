
Goodbye, little darlin', we're parting 
Parting don't always mean goodbye 
Although we had to part, you're always in my heart 
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye 

Goodbye, little darlin', I'll miss you 
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky 
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you so
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye 

Goodbye, little darlin', I love you
Love you until the day I die 
Would you dream a dream of me, wherever you may be 
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye
