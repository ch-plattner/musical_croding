
We are now up on top of Mount Tabor
And Jacob you're our guide so how about telling us in your own words
Just what happened at this place
I hope the wind is not making too much noise we are at a great height up here
(Here we are this is Mount Tabor
We are standing on the highest of the lower Galilee mountains watching around us
A most magnificent view really one can except to see
This of course is the Mountain of Trans-Figuration
Where Christ with his three elder disciples climbed up the mountain
And that is when at the same time they all spoke saying
Master Master can we have three tents made here
The place is so beautiful we want to stay
And at that same moment they saw Christ was conversing
With Moses and Delijah the prophet
A cloud came from which the voice of the Lord was heard saying
This is my son my chosen son Thou shalt obey
They watched to the face of Christ at that time
And saw that there was light around it
He was transfigured His tunic became as white as snow
So it's called the Mountain of Trans-Figuration
This is where it happened)
Thank you very much Jacob and you know there was another time that Moses
That you were talking about Moses climbed the mountain
