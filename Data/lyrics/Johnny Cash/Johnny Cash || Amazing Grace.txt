Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me 
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see 
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed 
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun 
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun
