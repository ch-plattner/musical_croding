
Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine

I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town

We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
'Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook

Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
'Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy

And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind

Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got in on my mind
