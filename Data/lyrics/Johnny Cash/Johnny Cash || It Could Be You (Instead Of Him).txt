
If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim

Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)

Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)

Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)

Shed a tear, share a sigh
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
