She gave me my walking papers
and ran off with someone new
Cuz he bought her things
my wages couldn't buy
So I turned to ups and downers
and everything between
Still I can't get her good lovin'
off my mind

Well today I bought a Cadillac
the kind she's always wanted
I called and asked her
if she'd like to ride
She said this is our last date
I said that's alright with me
cause tonight I'm driving her
out of my mind

Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
when she was mine
She'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when I drive her
out of my mind

All the papers will read "Lovers leap
again off Lookout Mountain"
Cause i wrote a note
that called it suicide
But my epitaph will say
"he killed his pain yesterday
when he finally drove that woman
off his mind"

Well now here she comes to greet me
dressed to kill and so am I
Hope she asks me if this
cadillac will fly
And I know that I'll die laughin'
when I show her that it will
when I drive that woman
right out of my mind

Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
when she was mine
She'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when I drive her
out of my mind

They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash
down here in Chatanooga
last night when he drove her
out of his mind

Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous

(ooh to the pearly gates)
(ooh to the pearly gates)
(ooh to the pearly gates ...)
