
Go on girl take your chances
See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay

You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay

Join your friends while you got 'em
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're livin'
And you still got the devil to pay

You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay
