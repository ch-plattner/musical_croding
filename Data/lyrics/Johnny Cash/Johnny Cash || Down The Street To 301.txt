There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)

Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)

When it's back to school this fall winter's chill may end it all
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)

Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)

The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)

Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)
