
The noises you hear in the background are the different little shops 
Here in the market place in Nazareth 
There's a man beating out some pans with a hammer there 
You know looking at Nazareth especially in this part of Nazareth 

You'd be inclined to feel like Nathaniel did when he said to Phillip in the Bible 
Can there be any good thing ever come from Nazareth 
And John the Babtist preaching repentance down on the Jordan River 
Which we'll be seeing later on today 

Said there's one coming after me the latchet of whose shoes 
I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose 
And the prophets had said referring to this place right here 
He shall be called a Nazarene
