Oh, I hate but you made it.
Your runnin', jumpin', laughin' filled with glee.
Oh, I told ya that I hold ya.
Just how did you get away from me?

I had bars on the windows had you chained to the floor.
And a moss covered monster at the door. (12 feet tall, that ain't all)
Had a bottemless moat with a hole in the boat.
And a big rattlesnake if you tried to make the break.
Had a swarm of bees a gorilla in the tress.
Just how did you get away from me? (You said I die if I try)

Aw, where'd you get the sense to get through the electric fence.
Your handcuffs are gone you're runnin' free.
What happen to my sniper with his high powered rifle.
Just how did you get away from me?

Is it true that you really did make it through.
How bout the tiger in the car. (And the dynomite you planted in the jar, in the car)
Did you go like a mole through a hole.
Or did you sail like a quail on the pole.
Give it to the news on TV. (So I can see)
Just how did you get away from me? (You said I die if I try)
Just how did you get away from me?
