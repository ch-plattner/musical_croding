Hey little girl with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song

You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song

Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhm
