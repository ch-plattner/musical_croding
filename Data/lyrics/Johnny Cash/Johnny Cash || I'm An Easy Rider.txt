I'm an easy rider, the wind is at my back
I'm an easy rider, the white line is my track
Every lane is a passin' lane and the ride away is mine
Let me on that straight-away and I'll be fairly flyin'

I'm an easy rider, my wheels love to roll
I'm an easy rider, I ride a new road every day
I'm an easy rider, I will see you on my way

I got a number down in every town in my little black book
And they understand that I'm a travelin' man
So they don't think they got hooked
I'm an easy rider, I love that gray highway

I'm an easy rider, oh Lord, I love to roll
I'm an easy rider, movin's in my soul
I know a lady down in Little Rock and I stopped for a little while
But I had to go 'cause another I know is waitin' for my smile

I'm an easy rider, I can't stay in one place
