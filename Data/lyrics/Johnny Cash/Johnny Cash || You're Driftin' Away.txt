
All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with god
You're drifting away you're drifting away

You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let jesus hear you pray

You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You can hear jesus callin' and you won't accept his hand
You're drifting away you're drifting away

When you come to the river jesus don't give thee command
You're drifting away you're drifting away
And the dark rollin' river takes you to the sinkin' sand
You're drifting away you're drifting away
