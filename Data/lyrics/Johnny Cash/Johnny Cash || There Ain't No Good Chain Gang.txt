
Bet it ain't raining back home
Bet your sister's still on the phone
Bet Momma's in the kitchen, cooking fried chicken
Wishing that I hadn't done wrong

Yeah, Momma, don't you worry about it none though
Everything's gonna be all right, Momma
They're teaching us a lot of new things in here Momma
Things like

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there ain't no good chain gang

Papa's reading yesterday's mail
Wishing that the hay was all baled
I bet he's a-wishing we could go fishing
And here I am a-laying in jail

Well, Papa, don't you worry about it none now
Everything's gonna be all right, Papa
They're teaching us a lesson a day we're learning pretty well too
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already
Things like

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there ain't no good chain gang

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there ain't no good chain gang

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there ain't no good chain gang
