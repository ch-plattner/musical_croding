
Well I took my Ruby jukin' 
On the out-skirts of town 
She took her high heels off 
And rolled her stockings down 
She put a quarter in the jukebox 
To get a little beat 
Everybody started watchin' 
All the rhythm in her feet 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

Now Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock 
And when she started rockin' 
She just couldn't stop 
She rocked on the tables 
And rolled on the floor 
And Everybody yelled: "Ruby rock some more!" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

It was 'round about four 
I thought she would stop 
She looked at me and then 
She looked at the clock 
She said: "Wait a minute Daddy 
Now don't get sour 
All I want to do 
Is rock a little bit more" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

One night my Ruby left me all alone 
I tried to contact her on the telephone 
I finally found her about twelve o'clock 
She said: "Leave me alone Daddy 
'cause your Ruby wants to rock" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul
