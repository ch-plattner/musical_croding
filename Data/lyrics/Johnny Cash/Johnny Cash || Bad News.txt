Ha ha ha come on bad news ha ha 
Well bad news travels like wild fire goodnews travels slow 
They all call me Wildfire ha ha cause everybody knows 
I'm bad news everywhere I go 
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go 
They tried to hang me in Oakland and the did in Francisco 
But I wouldn't choke I broke their rope and they had to let me go 
Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go 
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go 
Now from north to south east to west the story is the same 
From one state to another I have to change my name 
Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go 
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go 

Well now I've picked peaches in Georgia I lumberjacked in Maine 
I've been hired fired and jailed in any town you can name 
Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go 
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
