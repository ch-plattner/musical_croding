Have you found since you turned me down 
The one that you were searching for 
Are you glad that you made me sad 
For you know I vowed to love you ever more 

What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine 
Are you laughing in my face 
Darling what can I do when you say we're through 
You've left a wound time can't erase 

Tell me now are you satisfied 
To be foot loose and fancy free 
Is it power you want for the things that you've done 
What you've gained I guess I'll never see 

What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine 
Are you laughing in my face 
Darling what can I do when you say we're through 
You've left a wound time can't erase
