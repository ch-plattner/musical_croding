
There's a fire burning bright at our house tonight
Slow music playing and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms but it's all in my mind

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder

This old highway us like a woman
Sometimes she can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me to the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me from the ones that I love

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
God, I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
