When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle 
In them old cottonfields back home 
When I was a little bitty baby... 
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton 
In them old cottonfields back home 
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana 
In them old cottonfields back home 

When I was a little bitty baby... 
When I was a little bitty baby... 
In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home
