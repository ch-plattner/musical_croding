
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye, "
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.
