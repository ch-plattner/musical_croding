
I don't want no aggravation 
When my train has left the station 
If you're there or not, 
I may not even know 
Have a round and remember 
Things we did that weren't so tender 
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

On my guitar sell tickets 
So someone can finally pick it 
And tell the girls down at the Ritz 
I said hello 
Tell the gossipers and liars 
I will see them in the fire 
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

Let her blow, let her blow 
Long and loud and hard and happy 
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid 
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

You'll be left without excuses 
For the evils and abuses 
Down to today from years and years ago 
And have yourself another toke 
From my basket full of smoke 
And let the train blow the whistle when I go

Let her blow, let her blow 
Long and loud and hard and happy 
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid 
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
