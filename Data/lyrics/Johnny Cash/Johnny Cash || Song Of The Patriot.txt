
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I love mom and applie pie, 
And the freedoms that we all enjoy across this beautiful land
I work hard and I fight hard for the old Red, White, and Blue
And I'll die a whole lot harder if it comes to where I have to
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And when I see old Glory waving
I think of all the brave men who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
And when I see old Glory burnin, my blood begins to churnin 
And I could do some fightin' of my own
I don't believe in violence, I'm a God fearing man
Bul I'll stand up for my country just as long as I can stand
Cause I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And I enjoy the liberty of being what I want to be and achieve any goals that I can
I was taught to turn the other cheek, but daddy used to say
Walk soft and pack a big stick, but never walk away
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And When I see old Glory waving
I think of all the brave men who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
And when I see old Glory burnin, my blood begins to churnin 
And I could do some fightin' of my own
Cause I love all my brothers and were proud of our group
We've got the greenest country here on God's green earth
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
