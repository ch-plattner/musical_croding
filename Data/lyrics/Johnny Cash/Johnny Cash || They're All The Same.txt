
I've drank wine with winos in the alleys dim I've sipped wine with kings
I've seen wino's harlots makin' love to them I've seen kings with queens
But I find there is no difference to me they're all the same
Except their name for they all need wine and they all need love
To me they're all the same
I've seen the need for just one drink cause the tears to fall from the winos' eyes
I've seen the need for love make a kingdom fall even rich men cry
But I find there is no difference to me they're all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love
To me they're all the same
I watched the weeds grow higher on a pauper's grave where the wino lies
I saw a grave attended by a hundred slaves even rich men die
But I find there is no difference to me they're all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love
To me they're all the same
