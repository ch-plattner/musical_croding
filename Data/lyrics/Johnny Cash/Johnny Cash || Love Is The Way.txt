[Johnny Cash]
Deep in the heart of the infinite darkness
A tiny blue marble is spinning through space
Born in the splendor of God's holy vision
And sliding away like a tear down his face

[Johnny Cash]
The closer you see the whole, wide, holy wonder
Of oceans and mountains and rivers and trees
And the strangest creation of many: the human.
A creature of laughter and freedom and dreams

[Waylon Jennings]
Now the warriors are waving their old rusty sabres
And preachers are preaching the gospel of hate
By their behaviour they're determined to teach us
A lesson we're soon to be learning too late

[Johnny Cash]
Look closer, my brother, we're killing each other
And we'd better stop and get started today
Because life is the question and life is the answer
And God is the reason and love is the way.
Because life is the question and life is the answer
And God is the reason and love is the way.
