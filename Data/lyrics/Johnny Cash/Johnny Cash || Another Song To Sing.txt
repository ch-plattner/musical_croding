
Do they ask you where I am or where I've been 
Do they ever say where is the lonely friend 
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers 
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there 

Well there's always one more path that I must walk 
And there's people I should sit down with and talk 
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring 
So there's always another song to sing 

Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind 
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends 
And at other times I'd rather be alon 
Where I could not be found when I was gone 

Well there's always one more canyon to explore 
To touch the things left by those gone before 
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king 
And there's always another song to sing
