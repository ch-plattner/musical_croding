
Call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
I aint got me nobody
I dont carry me no load

Aint no change in the weather
Aint no changes in me
Well there aint no change in the weather
Aint no changes in me
And I aint hidin from nobody
Nobodys hidin from me
Oh, thats the way its supposed to be

Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin on
Well I might go out to california
Might go down to georgia
I dont know

Well I dig you georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I dont love me no one woman
So I cant stay in georgia long

Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
I aint got me nobody
I dont carry me no load
Oooh mr breeze
