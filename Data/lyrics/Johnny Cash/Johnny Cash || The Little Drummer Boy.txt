Come they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come

Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum

The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum
