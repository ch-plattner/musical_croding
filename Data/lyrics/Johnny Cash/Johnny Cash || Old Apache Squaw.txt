Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee?
Shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea?

Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man"

Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?

Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man"

Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
You've had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?
Old Apache Squaw
