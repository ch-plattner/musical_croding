You'd stand in the rain to buy a ticket
Front row seats are always first to go
You know all the songs as well as i do
This one's for the folks out on the road

You fight the crowds for autographs and pictures
A chance to shake a hand after the show
For all the times that we don't get to thank you
This one's for the folks out on the road

Thank you for the chance to make the music
The songs are the only thing i know
Some are for the money,some are for myself
This one's for the folks out on the road

For those of you who always play the records
For all of you who play the radio
Those who took the time for something special
This one's for the folks out on the road

This one's for the folks out on the road
