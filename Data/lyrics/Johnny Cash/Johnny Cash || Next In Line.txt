
The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, 'cause it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line

The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waitin' for your love
I'm tired and we're runnin' short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, 'cause I'm the next in line

I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break 'em one by one
My time is comin', so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waitin' way behind
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line
