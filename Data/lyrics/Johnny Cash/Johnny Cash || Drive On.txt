
I got a friend named Whiskey Sam 
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam 
He said is my country just a little off track 
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not coming back at all 
Many a good man 
I saw fall And even now, 
every time I dream I hear the men 
and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, don't mean nothin' 
My children love me , but they don't understand 
And I got a woman who knows her man 
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

I remember one night, 
Tex and me Rappelled in on a hot L.Z. 
We had our 16's on rock and roll 
But, with all that fire, 
was scared and cold 
We were crazy, we were wild 
And I have seen the tiger smile 
I spit in a bamboo viper's face 
And I'd be dead , but by God's grace

Drive on, don't mean nothin' 
My children love me, but they don't understand 
And I got a woman who knows her man 
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain 
And nobody tried to be John Wayne 
I came home, but Tex did not 
And I can't talk about the hit he got 
I got a little limp now when 
I walk Got a little tremolo when 
I talk But my letter read from Whiskey Sam 
You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam

Drive on, don't mean nothin' 
My children love me, but they don't understand 
And I got a woman who knows her man 
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on
