
Harley didn't have no education he could hardly read and write
He was locked into a dead-end occupation his future didn't look too bright
He worked eighteen years on the assembly line
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime
And that could be the end of this story of mine but it's just the beginning
Late one night when he was workin' graveyard Harley got himself this big idea
All he's have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a year
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop
Money started rollin' in like it wasn't gonna stop
So Harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top
So the losers could see whom was winnin'
Only in America with nothin' but a dream only in America where every man's king

First Harley's daughter Janet found a guru she gave him everything she owned
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband
And walked around all day about half stoned
His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a happy ending
Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a year
Now Harley's back working the assembly line
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime
But don't count Harley out cause he ain't the quittin' kind
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind
How to make them things more user-friendly
Only in America...
Only in America...
