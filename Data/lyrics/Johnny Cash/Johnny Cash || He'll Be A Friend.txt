He said it's gonna rain, gonna be dark
Call in the animals two by two
And don't let a sinful man go through

So the flood came just like He said
And every evil thing on earth was dead
But Noah's faith was like a rock
God laid his ark on a mountain top

He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through

When things look dark Noah saw the light
'Cause faith had told him right was might
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you

Well, you've heard of Samson, the strong man
The mightiest man in all the land
There was one purpose for his might
He had to deliver the Israelites

By the Philistines he was overcome
They tied him up to carry him home
But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone
He killed a thousand with an old jawbone

He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through

God showed Samson what to do
And it's the same God that stands by you
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you
