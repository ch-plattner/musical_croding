
Rowboat, row me to the shore.
She don't wanna be my friend no more.
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul.
She don't wanna be my friend no more.

Pick me up, gimme some food to eat,
In your truck goin' no place.
I'll be home talkin' to nobody.
You'll be strange, you'll be far away.

Big fat moon.
And my body's out of tune.
With the burnin' waves,
She's a billion years away.

Dog food on the floor,
And I've been like this before.
She is all,
And everything else is small.

Pick me up, gimme some alcohol,
In your truck playin' the radio.
I'll be home with the gasoline.
You'll be stoned, you'll be far away.

[Instrumental break]

Rowboat, row me to the shore.
She don't wanna be my friend no more.
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul.
She is all, and everything else is small.
