Oh wagon trains rollin' along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone 
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race 
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail 
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail 
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train 
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain 
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
Oh wagon trains rollin' along... 
Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh 
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh 
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh 
Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo 
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
