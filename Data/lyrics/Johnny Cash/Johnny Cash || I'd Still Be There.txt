
I overlooked a lot of things I knew I should have done 
I did things that I'm sorry for I lived to have my fun 
But now the world that once was bright is empty and bare 
And if you wouldn't be ashamed of me I'd still be there 
I'd be with you where I belong 
And nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong 
If all the love that made you mine could make you still care 
I'd be by your side I'd still be there 

I'd give the world if I could only have you close to me 
I'd pray the Lord to keep you safe wherever you may be 
Don't let anybody share the things we used to share 
If I only knew you loved me too I'd still be there 
I'd be with you where I belong... 
I'd be by your side I'd still be there
