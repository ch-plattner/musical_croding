
Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea fleein' to the sea
Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand
He said the next white man that sees my face is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears
Well now they tell me...
Old Apache squaw
