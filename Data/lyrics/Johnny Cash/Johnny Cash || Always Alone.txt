I lay motionless
And I think about
The paths I've chosen
Now I'm without
Those lovely days
Within my grasp
It won't be the same
With everything

It's on my mind
That's disappeared
I've moved on at last
Of all the past
And if you ask
When I'll be back
I'll say to you

I will never look back
That I'm never
I have heard
It is so absurd
I always want
Never to return
To look back home
But I'm always
Always alone
Always alone
When I have gone

Lost to space
It's hard to say
I'm always alone
