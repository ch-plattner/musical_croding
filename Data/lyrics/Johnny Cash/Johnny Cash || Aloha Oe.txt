Proudly swept the rain cloud by the cliffs
As on it glided through the trees
Still following, with glee, the liko
The a hihi lehua of the valley

Aloha, oe, aloha oe,
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace, a hoi ae au,
Until we meet again

Aloha oe, aloha oe,
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One embrace, a hoi ae au,
Until we meet again
