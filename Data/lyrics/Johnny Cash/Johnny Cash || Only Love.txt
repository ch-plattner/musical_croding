
You may live alone and close your eyes
Some folks do
You may dream a dream that's twice your size
All night through
But when the mornin' comes and who's to tell
Your dreams to only you

Only love love only only love will do
Only love love only only love comes true
Nothing else you see there's nothing else
Only love only love

But when the mornin' comes and who's to tell
Your dreams to only you

I have known a love within my heart
One or two
When one love would end one would start
I never knew
If love should come your way you learn to say
I love you I love you

Only love love only only love will do...
