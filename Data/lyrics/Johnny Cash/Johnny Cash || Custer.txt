And the General he don't ride well anymore 
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin' 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin' 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again 
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore 
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin' 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore
