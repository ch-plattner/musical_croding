That's what you get for lovin' me 
That's what you get for lovin' me 
Everything you have is gone that you can see 
That's what you get for lovin' me 

I ain't the kind to hang around 
With any new love that I found 
Movin' is my stock and trade 
I'm movin' on 
I won't think of you when I'm gone 

So don't you shed a tear for me 
I ain't the love you thought I'd be 
I've got a hundred more like you 
So don't be blue 
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through 

Now there you go you're cryin' again 
Now there you go you're cryin' again 
But then someday your poor heart is on the mend 
I just might pass your way again 

That's what you get for lovin' me 
That's what you get for lovin' me 
Everything you have is gone that you can see 
That's what you get for lovin' me 

That's what you get for lovin' me 
That's what you get for lovin' me
