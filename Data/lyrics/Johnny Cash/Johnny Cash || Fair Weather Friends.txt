
Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.

We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But he's a solid rock when troubles grow,
And he's holding out a saving hand for me.

Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.

He'll be a refuge in the storm;
He'll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt he'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way he'll be your light.

Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures...
