Then listen very carefully to me
You can sing them like a funny foreign song
And very very soon, you sing alone
And you can sing your ABC's like this, here's the first State letters
Ah bos cee dah - ef fah gha hah
Ah bos cee dah - ef fah gha hah
A b c d - e f g h
Ah bos cee dah - ef fah gha hah
And the next State letters in the alphabet, you sing like this
Ay jah kah lah - meh nah ou pah
Ay jah kah lah - meh nah ou pah
I j k l - m n o p
Ay jah kah lah - meh nah ou pah
Well, that's sixteen letters of the alphabet and there's ten more, you know
But let's try those last ten, slow
Queh ahr see tah uh - vee whu ix yah zee
Queh ahr see tah uh - vee whu ix yah zee
Q r s t u - v w x y z
Queh ahr see tah uh - vee whu ix yah zee
Now let's try them all
Ah bos cee dah - ef fah gha hah
Ay jah kah lah - meh nah ou pah
Queh ahr see tah uh - vee whu ix yah zee - means
A b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
