There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within

Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within

Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know
