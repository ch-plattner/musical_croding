Did you walk another mile, turn a frown with a smile?
Did you lift the lowly heart about to break?
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted?
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break?
Did you sow the proper seed? Are you keeping out the weeds?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Will you be one of the meek, did you turn the other cheek?
Would you give a little more than you would take?
Did you shine your little light upon the children of the night?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted?
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break?
Did you sow the proper seed? Are you keeping out the weeds?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?
