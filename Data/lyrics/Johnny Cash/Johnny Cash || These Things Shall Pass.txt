
These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne

A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure

These things shall pass so don't you worry
The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone

A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure

These things shall pass
