Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me talkin' to myself, gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall

She changes with the weather like the leaves I recall
She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
A two timin' woman with a heart of solid stone
She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little undergrown

Well, she said she'd never leave me but she'd got the urge to roam
She drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She never changes course, she just goes along that same ol' way
And I hope she keeps a driftin' rolls along back home someday

'Cause if I ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
And tell her "Now sit there woman you ain't leavin' no more"
I'm gonna tame you mama till you're eatin' from my hand
It's not that I don't love you honey it's just to make you understand

I woke up this morning in a terrible mood
Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me talkin' to myself, gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall
