Well, have you seen my darkhaired girl?
She was set on her love to a hungry world
They got her clothes anA the money she took
And they wrote her name in the prison books

Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl?
She's tired and cold and you got the gold
She took from a hungry world
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl?

Well have seen my green eyed son?
He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain

Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?
I heard him say as you let him away 
Sorry for what he's done
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?

Well have you missed my brother man?
He took a little money with a gun in his hand
Know the kids are hungry and the wife ain't well
And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell

Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
I know it's sad but he ain't bad 
He's doing the best he can
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
