We've been together too long to conceal
What's in our hearts maybe we should part but after so many years
That would only bring loneliness sorrow and tears and anyway

I never could never would never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again we'll start a brand new dance between ol' friends

There will always be days when it don't seem to pay when it just doesn't rhyme
Well it's bound to happen some of the time
Our best days ain't gone we don't need to move on well maybe we could try
But I don't think you ould make it and neither could I and anyway
I never could...

Baby come here love ain't disappeared you're just feelin' low
And let me tell you my darlin' it's a feelin' I know
It don't mean too much we just got out of touch well that's easy to change
Cause lovin' you ain't too hard to arrange and anyway

I never could never would never will ever kill what's between us...
