Put myself through
The fights I 
Didn't need to fight
This thick head of mine 
Ya couldn't get through
Had to do it wrong
Just to get it right
...just to get it right

I learned the Hard Way
The hard way taught me well
The hard way 
Sure put me (this boy) through some hell
The hard way
Taught me how to tell
The right way from the wrong
And on which side I belong

Deep are the memories 
As a young boy
Of the lessons
That I learned
My mama warnin' me
That fire is no toy
Ya play with fire boy
And you get burned
...Oh I got burned

I learned the Hard Way
I learned the Hard Way

What others learned in Sunday school
I learned by gettin' black n' blue

I learned the Hard Way
I learned the Hard Way
