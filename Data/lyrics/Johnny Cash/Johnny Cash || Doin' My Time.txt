
On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

When that old judge looked down and smiled
Said I put you up that river for a while Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

Well now it won't be long just a few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my time
