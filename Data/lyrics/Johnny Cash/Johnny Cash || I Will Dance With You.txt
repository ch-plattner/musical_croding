I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you
I'd spread my wings before you ever learned to fly like flocks of wild geese in the sky
See one more shore before they die I will fly with you
With you I'll dream before we ever fall asleep the dreams you always hope to keep
And though they may fall to our feet I will dream with you

I'd drink your wine and taste the sweetness of your fine
And if I haven't aged with time before the days begin to twine I will age with you
I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you
