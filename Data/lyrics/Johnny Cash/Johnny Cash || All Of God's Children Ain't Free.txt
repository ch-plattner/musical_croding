I'd open up every door I can cause all God's children ain't free
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land
And he held out his hand to me all God's children ain't free
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children ain't free
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong
Cause all God's children ain't free
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die
But taking everything that he's livin' by
And reject him from society all God's children ain't free
No reject him from society all God's children ain't free

I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children ain't free
I'd have a smile for all I meet but all God's children ain't free
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free
