
I looked over Jordan and what did i see?
Commin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels, a-commin after me
Commin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home

I'm sometimes up, and i'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But but i know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a-comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
And now they're commin for to carry me home
