What can wash away my sin
what can make me whole again
what can cleans me from within
nothing but the blood

For my pardon this I see
for my cleansing this my plea
draw my wandering heart to thee
nothing but the blood

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
nothing but the blood...
nothing but the blood of Jesus

this is all my hope and peace
this is all my righteousness
Lord in you, I've found my rest
nothing but the blood

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
no other fount I know
nothing but the blood

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
no other fount I know
nothing but the blood
nothing but the blood of Jesus

nothing can for sin atone
Naught of good that I have done
By you're grace this war is won
nothing but the blood

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
no other fount I know
nothing but the blood

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
no other fount I know
nothing but the blood...
yeahh

oh precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow
no other fount I know
nothing but the blood
nothing but the blood of Jesus
yeahhh
