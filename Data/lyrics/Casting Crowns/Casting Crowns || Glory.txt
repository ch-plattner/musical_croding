You are holy in this place
You are worthy of my praise and we worship You
Jesus we worship You

You're the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
You're the Master of the Universe
You're the Ruler of all Nations
And we sing to You, sing to You 

When You call my name, I'll run to You
I'll do anything You ask me to 
Falling on my knees I worship You, my Lord 
We give You GLORY

Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
