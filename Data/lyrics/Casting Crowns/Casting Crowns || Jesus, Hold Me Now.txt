Living on my own, thinking for myself 
Castles in the sand, temporary wealth 
Now the walls are falling down 
Now the storms are closing in 
And here I am again 

Jesus, hold me now 
I need to feel You in this place 
To know You’re by my side 
And hear Your voice tonight 
Jesus, hold me now 
I long for Your embrace 
I’m beat and broken down 
I can’t find my way out 
Jesus, hold me now 

Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day 
Of reaping what I’ve sown, living with my shame 
Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made 
One day you’re a prince, and the next day you’re a slave 

Lord, I just looked up today 
And realized how far away I am from where You are 
I don’t know what else to pray 
Broken at Your feet I lay 
The life I’ve torn apart 

Jesus, hold me now 
Jesus, hold me now 
Jesus, hold me now 
Jesus, hold me now
