Here I am a sinner 
Broken and in need of You 
Take my life and wash my fears away 
For You are the Great I AM 
Rest assured, I feel Your hand 
Holding me until the darkness clears 
A Father to the fatherless 
Redeemer of my soul 
My Life is Yours forever 
I want the world to know 

Your mercy saved me 
Mercy made me whole 
Your mercy found me 
Called me as Your own 

Here I stand a child of Yours 
Broken and in need of You 
Break these chains and wash my guilt away 
Healer of my brokenness 
My weary soul will find its rest 
You are my strength, the lifter of my head 
You're greater than my yesterdays 
You hold me close today 
You're the Lord of my tomorrows 
My heart will always say 
You're greater than my yesterdays 
You hold me close today 
You're the Lord of my tomorrows 
My heart will always say 

You called me as Your own 
You called me as Your own 
Thank You for Your mercy 
Thank You for Your mercy 

You called me as Your own 
Your own
