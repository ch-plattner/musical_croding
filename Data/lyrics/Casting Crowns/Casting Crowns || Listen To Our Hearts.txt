
How do you explain
How do you describe
A love that goes from East to West
And runs as deep as it is wide
You know all our hopes
Lord, You know all our fears
And words cannot express the love we feel
But we long for You to hear

So listen to our hearts
Hear our spirits sing
A song of praise that flows
For those You have redeemed
And we use the words we know
To tell you what an awesome God You are
But when words are not enough
To tell You of our love
Just listen to our hearts

If words could fall like rain
From these lips of mine
And if I had a thousand years
I would still run out of time
So if You listen to my heart
Every beat will say
Thank you for the Life
Thank you for the Truth
Thank you for the Way

And listen to hearts (oh, Lord, please listen)
Hear our spirits sing (and hear us sing)
A song of praise that flows (a song of praise)
From those of You have redeemed (from those You have redeemed)
And we will use the words we know
To tell you what an awesome God You are
But when words are not enough
To tell You of our love
Just listen to our hearts

So if You listen to my heart
Every beat will say
Thank You for the Life
Thank You for the Truth
Thank You for the Way

And listen to our hearts (oh, Lord, please listen)
Hear our spirits sing (and hear us sing)
A song of praise that flows (a song that flows)
From those of You have redeemed (from those You have redeemed)
And we will use the words we know
To tell You what an awesome God You are
But when words are not enough
To tell You of our love
Just listen to our hearts

When words are not enough
To tell You of our love
Just listen to our hearts
Listen to our hearts (oh, Lord, please listen)
Listen to our hearts
