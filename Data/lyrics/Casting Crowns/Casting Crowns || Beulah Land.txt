
Beulah Land, I'm longing for you
And some day on thee I'll stand
There my home shall be eternal
Beulah Land - Sweet Beulah Land

I'm kind of homesick for a country
To which I've never been before
No sad goodbyes will there be spoken
For time won't matter anymore

Beulah Land, I'm longing for you
And some day on thee I'll stand
There my home shall be eternal
Beulah Land - Sweet Beulah Land

I'm looking now across the river
Where my faith will end in sight
There's just a few more days to labor
Then I will take my heavenly flight

Beulah Land, I'm longing for you
And some day on thee I'll stand
There my home shall be eternal
Beulah Land - Sweet Beulah Land
