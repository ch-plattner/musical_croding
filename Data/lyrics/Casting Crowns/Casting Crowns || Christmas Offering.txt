While angels sang to lowly shepherds
Three wisemen seeking truth, they traveled from afar
Hoping to find the Child from Heaven falling on their knees
They bow before the humble Prince of peace

We bring an offering of worship to our King
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due
O Lord, I bring an offering to You

The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love
There is no shadow in Your presence
No mortal man would dare to stand before Your throne
Before the Holy One of Heaven, it's only by Your blood
It's only through Your mercy, Lord I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due
O Lord, I bring an offering to You

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due
O Lord, I bring an offering to You

We bring an offering to You
We are an offering to You
An offering of praise we sing
An offering to You

We are an offering to You, Jesus
An offering of praise we sing
An offering to You
We are an offering, oh Lord

We are an offering of worship to our King
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due
O Lord, we bring an offering to You
O Lord, we bring an offering

Offering to You
We bring an offering to You
We are an offering to You
