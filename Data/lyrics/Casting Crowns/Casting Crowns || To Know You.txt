
To know you is never worry for my life, and 
To know you is to never to give in or compromise 
To know you is to want to tell the world about you 
Cause I can't live without you 

To know you is to hear your voice when you are calling 
To know you is to catch my brother when he is falling 
To know you is to feel the pain of the broken hearted 
Cause they can't live with out you. 

More than my next breath 
More than life or death 
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more 
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies 
To know you is to want to know you more 
To know you is to want to know you more 

To know you is to ache for more than ordinary 
To know you is to look beyond the temporary 
To know you is believing that you will be enough 
Cause there is no life without you 

More than my next breath 
More than life or death 
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more 
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies 
To know you is to want to know you more 
To know you is to want to know you more 

All this life could offer me, could not compare to you 
Compare to you 
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you 
Knowing you 

More than my next breath 
More than life or death 
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more 
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies 
To know you is to want to know you more 
To know you is to want to know you more 

Compared to you 
Compared to you 
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you 
Knowing you 
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you 
Knowing you
