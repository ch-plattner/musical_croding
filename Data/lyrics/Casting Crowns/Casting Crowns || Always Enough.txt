In the dry and weary land
Lord, You are the rain
In a sea of shattered ones
Your love comes rushing in

You hold the world within Your hands
And see each tear that falls
Through every fire and every storm
You're always enough, always enough

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak
Your love is the anthem of nations
Rings out through the ages
And You're always enough for me

In the watches of the night
Lord, You are my song
Hope is in the morning light
Your love shines like the dawn

You keep my heart in perfect peace
My life is in Your hands
When confusion hides my way
You're always enough, always enough

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak
Your love is the anthem of nations
Rings out through the ages
And You're always enough for me

I'll rejoice for my Saviour reigns
I'll rejoice for He lives in me
God on high, He has set me free
And worthy is the Lord
I'll rejoice for my Saviour reigns
I'll rejoice for He lives in me
God on high, He has set me free
And worthy is the Lord

[2x]
Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak
Your love is the anthem of nations
Rings out through the ages
And You're always enough for me

I'll rejoice for my Saviour reigns
I'll rejoice for He lives in me
God on high, he has set me free
And worthy is the Lord

In the dry and weary land
Lord, You are the rain
