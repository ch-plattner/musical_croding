
Hear our cry, Lord we pray, 
Our faces down, our hands are raised, 
You called us out, we turned away, we've turned away. 

With ship wrecked faith, idols rise, 
We do what is right, in our own eyes, 
Our children now, will pay the price, 
We need Your light, Lord, shine Your light. 

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now, 
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out. 

All our hearts, all our strength, 
With all our minds, we're at Your fate, 
May Your Kingdom come, in our hearts and lives, 
Let Your Church arise, let Your Church arise! 

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now, 
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out 

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now, 
We're are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out, 
If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now, 
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out 

We need You now 
Revive us now 
We need You now
