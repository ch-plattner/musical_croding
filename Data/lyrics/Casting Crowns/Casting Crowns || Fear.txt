Oh, what I would do
To have the kind of faith it takes
To climb out of this boat I'm in
Onto the crashing waves
To step out of my comfort zone
Into the realm of the unknown
Where Jesus is,
And He's holding out His hand

But the waves are calling out my name
And they laugh at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The waves they keep on telling me
Time and time again
"Boy, you'll never win,
You'll never win,
You'll never win."

Oh, what I would do to have 
the kind of strength it takes
To stand before a giant
With just a sling and stone
Surrounded by the sound
Of a thousand warriors
Shaking in their armour
Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand

But the giant's calling out
My name and he laughs at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The giant keeps on telling me
Time and time again
"Boy, you'll never win,
You'll never win,
You'll never win."

But the stone was just the right size
To take the giant down
And the waves don't seem so high
When I'm standing on top of them looking down
And I'd soar with the wings of eagles
If I could just ignore the sound
Of the waves and the giants,
The waves and the giants in my mind

Lord, you've not given me a spirit of fear
But of power and of love,
And of a sound mind
So from now on,
I won't let the tempter's lies
Turn my eyes away from the prize
That you have set before me,
That you have set before me.
