
At the end of myself
I'm empty and dry
I have nothing to give
But surrender inside
Let down your nets
This is not the end
From now on, you'll be
Fishers of men

Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me

At the end of myself
Judgment calls out my name
Ive been looking for love
But I'm swallowed by shame
Throw away all your stones
Find forgiveness in Me
Let Me be your new passion
My daughter, you're free

At the end of myself
Ive done things my own way
This world gave up on me
Now its death I do pay
You know who I am
I'm sins sacrifice
Today you will be
In paradise

Who is this man who calmed the seas
And who is this man who loves the least of these

I am the promised One
God gave His only Son
And those who believe
Will live eternally

At the end of yourself, just follow Me
When you lose everything, just follow Me
I will give you new life, just follow Me
Follow Me

If at the end of yourself, just follow Me
You may lose everything, just follow Me
I will give you new life, just follow Me
Follow Me
