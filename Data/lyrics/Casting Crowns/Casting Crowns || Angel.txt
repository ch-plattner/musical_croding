
It was a day
Just like any other day
I was a boy
Just like every other boy

But when the girl
Unlike any I had seen
It's like she stepped out of a dream
And into my world

Could have been the summer wind
Playing with her hair
As the sun danced in her eyes
We were standing there

She smiled I forgot my name
'Cause all I was thinking

Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life

You're the proof that the Father answers prayers
'Cause somehow someway
You and I are standing here

With the sacred promise
And a ring that says it all
I've just begun to fall
From the deepest part of me I say I do

Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life
After all the changing seasons
Have turned to years
The crowns are gone
And the suns have faded

I'd still be here
Holding you
When thanking heaven
For my angel

Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life
