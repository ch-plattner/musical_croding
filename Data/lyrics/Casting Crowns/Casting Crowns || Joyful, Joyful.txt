Joyful, joyful, we adore You 
God of glory, Lord of love 
Hearts unfold like flowers before You 
Opening to the sun above 
Joyful, joyful, we adore You 
God of glory, Lord of love 
Hearts unfold like flowers before You 
Opening to the sun above 
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness 
Drive the dark of doubt away 

Joyful, joyful, we adore You 
Hearts unfold like flowers before You 
Joyful, joyful, we adore You 
Joyful, we adore You 

All Your works with joy surround You 
Earth and Heaven reflect Your ways 
Stars and angels sing around You 
Center of unbroken praise 
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness 
Drive the dark of doubt away 
God, our Father 
Christ, our Brother 
All who live in love are thine 
Teach us how to love each other 
Lift us to the joy divine 

Oh, God, our Father 
Christ, our Brother 
All who live in love are thine 
Teach us how to love each other
