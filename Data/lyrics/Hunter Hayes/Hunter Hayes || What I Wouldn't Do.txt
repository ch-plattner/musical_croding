
They would sing a song of love for you
With words that'd sweep you off your feet
They would climb a mountain top so high
And write your name up in the sky
They would do almost anything
I don't think they have a clue of
What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
Ohhh
They would treat you like the queen of hearts
Fifty-two beats other you
They'd lay down their own lives for you
They would cry a thousand tears
They'd expect nothing in return
I don't think they have a clue of

What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
Ohh, what I wouldn't do
I wanna love you just like I'd love to
I'm no Romeo and you're no Juliet
Say this love of yours and mine ain't over yet
They would sing, oh anything
I don't think they know the truth of
What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
Ohh, what I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
What I wouldn't do
(What I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do for you
(What I wouldn't do for you)
