
Everybody, they think they know us,
They think they've got us figured out,
Waste their words just trying to tell us,
How the typical, predictable, young love turns out

But little do they know girl, we've got a fast car
A James Dean spirit and a Norma Jean heart.
This blank sheet of paper has been waiting forever,
So baby just tell me where you wanna start

You and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind,
It's ours to write, it's our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline

We can pack for Paris, plan for Tennessee,
Oceans, mountains, hey I don't care as long as you’re with me
Running like crazy, kissing in public
Who cares what the world thinks?
Girl they don't know nothing about us

You and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind,
It's ours to write, it’s our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline

Let's make the story of our lives whatever we wanna make it,
There's rules about the way this works I think it’s time that we break them,
From the moment that I met you there's just one thing I’ve been praying
If this boy gets you girl, girl would you take my name?

'cause you and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind,
It's ours to write, it’s our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline

I said right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline

It's all in our storyline,
It's part of our storyline,
It's all in our, all in our storyline
