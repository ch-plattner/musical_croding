I'm not happy
Though I know I'm not sad
I'm not real pleased
Though I can't say that I'm mad
I've got no name for my state of mind
Call me undefined

I'm not content
Though I'm not out of place
I'm homesick
Though I've been home all day
I've got no reason, reason why
I'm undefined

It's great, the state I'm in
Calling this no emotion within
How I wish I knew what was wrong this time
Call me undefined, oh, undefined

I'm lonely
Though I'm not alone
She's here with me
Though it feels like her heart is gone
How I wish I knew why
I've been so lonely, so lonely tonight
Oh, I'm undefined
