We get so close but we never touch,
Gotta wear this mask for just long enough
To get away from all the eyes that stare us down.
Like two criminals with the dream to steal,
Not a trace to be found of the way we feel.
With our hearts on line, we give in and we get away.

Secret love, all the things we do,
For secret love, baby me and you,
Got a secret love.
Stayin' under cover and out of sight,
If nobody knows, then we're doin' it right.
Secret love.
Got a secret love.

When you're living a life that you gotta deny,
When you feel how we feel, but you gotta keep lying,
It's only gonna mess you up inside.
When you walk by each other in a crowded room,
And nobody sees how I'm looking at you,
But we'll meet in a minute at the rendezvous.
Only you know what I mean.

Secret love, all the things we do,
For secret love, baby me and you,
Got a secret love.
Stayin' under cover and out of sight,
If nobody knows, then we're doin' it right.
Secret love.
Got a secret love.

We're in love but nobody knows.
We're in love but nobody knows.
We're in love but nobody knows it yet.
Are we in love if nobody knows?
Are we in love if nobody knows?
Are we in love if nobody knows it yet?
I guess it's a secret.

oh yeah

Secret love, all the things we do,
For secret love, baby me and you,
Got a secret love.
Under cover and out of sight,
If nobody knows, then we're doin' it right.
Got a secret love.
We got a secret love.
Secret love.

Are we in love if nobody knows?
We in love if nobody knows,
Are we in love nobody knows?
Well I guess it's a secret.
