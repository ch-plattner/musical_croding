Hit me last night like a ton of bricks,
if this is really it, this is starting over
There's no should've, could've, would've said this, 
done that, no turning back, no more I wonders
No harm done, no hard feelings,
maybe some other time but gives me some peace of mind
If that was the end of the ride, I'm getting back in line

Cause I'm telling you
there's nothing like starting over,
there's nothing like shedding a heartache,
writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,
that bittersweet comfort of knowing you 
can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
There's nothing like starting over,
there's nothing like starting over

Love's got a way of letting you know 
when the time to hold on or time to let go, tells you so
It's the cold in the kiss, of looking away,
the say what you mean, well do you mean what you say?
I don't really know
It's time to reset, rethink, reposition,
there's nothing wrong with me, it's just a condition
It's the science of love, fly when we fall, through it all, 
we turn with the tide, cause we're free on the other side

There's nothing like starting over,
there's nothing like shedding a heartache,
writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,
that bittersweet comfort of knowing you 
can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
There's nothing like starting over,
there's nothing like starting over, starting over

yeah

One is a lonely number,
it kind of makes you wonder
how starting back at zero can feel so nice,
but it feels just right

Cause there just ain't nothing like,
there's nothing like starting over,
there's nothing like shedding a heartache,
writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,
that bittersweet comfort of knowing you 
can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
Nothing like starting over, yeah yeah yeah,
no there's nothing like,
no there's nothing like starting over, no, no, no, no, no
Starting over
