I get lost sometimes, like everybody else,
Lose tracking my lifelines, lose track of myself
And there's all kinds of reasons to be scared and run away
It's a good time for sad times like heaven couldn't be 
Farther from the places, that heaven always finds me,
If nobody cares, tell me how is it I keep getting saved this way

[Chorus:]
It's a sunrise from a lonely night
Like a smile in a strangers eyes
It's the moments that save my life, 
nobody knows about like flashlights
there's just enough hope when it shines, 
to go one scared step at a time
When the world's too dark I find, your flashlight, yeah

I'm glad nobody's counting, I'm glad you don't keep score
My prayers are all the same, it's the ones I prayed before
Thank you, but forgive me, my rough around the edges heart is yours
And the moments where you swear I'm just screaming at the sky,
It's the strangest conversation or a friend just stopping by
and it's funny when I realize all the places that your miracles can hide

[Chorus]

Like a sunrise from a lonely night
Like a smile in a strangers eyes
It's the moments that save my life, nobody knows about
Like flashlights
and there's just enough hope when it shines, to go one scared step at a time
When the world's too dark I find, your flashlight

Oh, who am I?
Dust and water,
Touched by the Divine

Tell me who, who am I?
you keep shining on me, shining on me, yeah
shining on me

It's the moments that save my life nobody knows about
It's like a flashlight
(there's just enough hope when it shines) 
And its just enough hope when it shines, 
(to go one scared step at a time) to go one step at a time
(when the world's to dark I find your flashlight) 
When the world's too dark I find your flashlight

It's a sunrise from a lonely night
It's a smile in a strangers eyes
It's the moments that save my life nobody knows about
Like flashlights
It's just enough hope when it shines, to go one scared step at a time
When the world's too dark I find, your flashlight

(Like a sunrise from a lonely night
like a smile in a strangers eyes) who am I
(its the moments that save my life nobody know about
like flashlights) oh yeah
(its just enough to hope when it shines, 
to go one scared step at a time
when the world too dark I find) 
you keep shining your light, you keep shining your light, eh eh

I'm just finding your flashlight
