
Say that you love me, even if it's not true.
And say that this storm is just passing through.
And, baby, tell me you're not leaving.
It's just the rainy season.

The air's getting heavy and we both know why.
So dance one more dance and tell one more lie.
And, baby, let's keep make believing
That it's just the rainy season.

We're taking on water.
And drop after drop we're destroying this house
And each other.
So make it stop.
Make it stop.

We're taking on water.
Yeah, drop after drop we're destroying this house
And each other, yeah.
Please, make it stop.

Wish I could just say and words were enough
To keep you from being the one giving up.
Like the sky letting go for no reason
Yeah, in the rainy season.
Baby tell me, you're not leaving.
It's just the rainy season.
It's just the rainy season.

It's just the rain
Yeah, it's just the rain.

It's just the rainy season.
