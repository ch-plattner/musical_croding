
Was the heart that I gave
The dreams that I made
With someone who don’t care
The time that I wasted
Feelings I chased
That just led me nowhere
The sleepless nights, the drag-out fights
That silence always won
The tears that I cried
The breaking inside
The loneliness to come

[Chorus]
It’s alright, is this goodbye
Won’t hurt me for too long,
I’ll be fine on my own
It’ll take some time
But I know that I
I can find where I belong,
And I’ll find it in a song

There's songs about freedom, searching for new love,
How ignorance is bliss
Yeah, I know that I’m not the only fool who’s been
Hurt just like this
Yeah, songs about making honest mistakes,
And heartaches I’ve gone through
Yeah, then I’ll forgive,
I won’t have to forget
All the good things about you

[Chorus]
It’s alright, yeah, this goodbye
Won’t hurt me for too long,
I’ll be fine on my own
It’ll take some time
But I know that I
I can find where I belong
And I’ll find it in a soooong
Oooh oh oooh oh
no, ooooooh, oooooh oh

Well I'm sure if I had
The chance to go back
I'd change more than I should
But knowing I can't is helping my chances
Of moving on for good
Now I'm not saying 
There won't be too many lonely nights
But the songs that I choose getting over you
Help me make it out alive

[Chorus]
Yeah, it’s alright, this goodbye
It won’t hurt me for too long
I can make it on my own
It’ll take some time
But I know that I
I can find where I belong
And I’ll find it in a song
Yeah, I'll find it in a song

Find it in a song, mmm
I'll find myself in a song,
I'll find myself in a song
