
If it's just me,
I think we need to talk about some things
If it's just me,
Then tell me what you want, say anything
If it's just me,
I'll hang up now and call you back when I've had time to think

If it's just me,
Crying alone in the middle of the night
Then it's just me,
And my tendency to overanalyze
And if it's just me,
Holding on to someone letting go,
Then I will let go of you

I'll take the blame, take the shame, walk away, no questions asked
Leave the best of me with you and you can leave me in your past
No battle cry, no battle scars
We're only down one broken heart
I guess you're free, if it's just me

If it's just me

If it's just me,
One shadow on the wall on a coffee cup
Then it's just me,
And a picture hanging I can't let go of
And if it was just me,
Why didn't I know you needed me to keep my big mouth shut?
Yeah, cause when it come down to it, you know

I'll take the blame, take the shame, walk away, no questions asked
Leave the best of me with you and you can leave me in your past
No battle cry, no battle scars
We're only down one broken heart
I guess you're free, if it's just me

Yeah, yeah

I've got no problem holding on
I've got no problem being wrong
But if you're gone, then after all
Well, it's just me

I'll take a walk, clear my thoughts, move along, no questions asked
Take whatever's left of me and leave you in my past

No more crying, no more scars,
I'd love to stay, but I got to say
I'd rather be free, if its-if it's just me, oh

If it's just me, it's just me
If it's just me
Then it's just me, yeah
