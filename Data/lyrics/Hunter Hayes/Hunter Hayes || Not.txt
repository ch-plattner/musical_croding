I'm so glad you called, 
It's good to hear from you again 
I've Been so much better since you said we'd just be friends
It's not as bad as I thought it would be,
To not have someone everyday calling and loving me 

Since you've been gone, 
I've found somebody else 
I've finally moved on 
Now I'm back to my old self 
I've got my smile back 
And I'm laughing a lot
I'm so much better now that you gone 
Not

It's kinda nice not having to pick up the phone
Not havin' anyone to talk to all day long 
Nothing wrong with doin nothin and talkin to the wall, 
Yeah life ain't so bad, 
When your on your own 

Since you've been gone, 
I've found somebody else
I've finally moved on 
Now I'm back to my old self 
I've got my smile back 
And I'm laughing a lot 
I'm so much better now that you gone
Not

Since you've been gone 
I've found somebody else
I've finally moved on, 
Now I'm back to my old self
I've got my smile back 
And I'm laughing a lot 
I'm so much better now that you gone 

(oh now that your gone) 

Oh since you've been gone, 
I've found somebody else 
I've finally moved on 
Now I'm back to my old self 
I've got my smile back 
And I'm laughing a lot
I'm so much better now that your gone 

ohhhh

I'm so much better now that your gone 
Oh I've finally moved on
Now I'm back, now I'm back, 
Now I'm back to my old self

Oh 
Yeaaahhhh
Ohhh

Since you've been gone, 
I found somebody else
I finally moved on, 
Now I'm back to my old self
Now I'm so much better now that you're gone
Oh, I'm so much better now that you're gone.
NOT
