You open your heart, open your mind, let somebody in
Take a walk through your past,
The good and the bad, decide you can do this again
But it's supposed to feel different,
Supposed to feel safe, safe like going home
But just like sand it slips through your hands
Before you know it your faith is gone

Every late night call,
Every morning kiss, all the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand, do you even care
If you love me like you said you did well you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody, yeah

It's all just a blur, the nights are the worst,
This bed still smells like you
Wake up from the dreams, catch my breath,
It takes everything I've got to move
Yeah it could've been a long long talk to fix this,
The seas were getting rough but I thought we were worth it,
Worth the try, worth the fight, shows you what I know, yeah

Every late night call,
Every morning kiss, all the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand, do you even care
If you love me like you said you did well you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody, yeah-yeah

Tell me where did you go when the lights came up,
I don't even know you anymore
But holding a knife I can see things better,
Yeah you've done this before

You think you know, mmm
Yeah, you think you know somebody,
Think you know,
You think you know,
You think you know,
You think you know,
Think you know

Every late night call,
Every morning kiss,
All the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand, do you even care
If you love me like you said you did you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody

You think you know somebody, yeahh-aa-yeah
You think you know,
You think you know,
You think you know somebody, yeah,
You think you know,
You think you know,
You think you know somebody,
(Think you know, you think you know, think you know somebody, you think you know, you think you know, you think you know somebody)
You never know,
You never know
