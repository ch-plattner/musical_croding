
There's two kinds of prayers on your knees
The ones that you need and the ones that you mean
Whatever I think or believe
Either way, you are the answer for me

Somewhere between darkness and light
And the gray where we live between wrong and right
Whether I'm lost or I'm washed in the river
You love me a saint or a sinner

From hellbent and chasing a dream
To crying and coming apart at the seams
I'm a love story full of extremes
Yeah, I'd never ask you but you'll always be

Somewhere between darkness and light
And the gray where we live between wrong and right
Whether I'm lost or I'm washed in the river
You love me a saint or a sinner
Yeah, you love me a saint or a sinner

I love you, there's no secret why
But the reasons you love me are harder to find
It doesn't add up, at least not to me
But somehow you see who I'm trying to be

Somewhere between darkness and light
And the gray where we live between wrong and right
Whether I'm lost or I'm washed in the river
You love me a saint or a sinner
You love me a saint or a sinner, yeah

Somehow we've stumbled our way into love
A long life with you isn't long enough
Somehow we've stumbled our way into love
A long life with you isn't long enough
You love me a saint or a sinner
You love me a saint or a sinner
