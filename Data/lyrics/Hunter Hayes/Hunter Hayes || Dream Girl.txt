Boy, you'd lose your mind
But girl, you got too many colors to be read and black and white

It's past the point of keeping me up at night
Now it's more like a beautiful movie that never ends
Wanna close my eyes and play it again

Dream girl, look my way
Baby, come and wake me, only you can make me
Dream, girl, dream this way
And you don't even know my name, oh
Dream girl, if you only knew 
How much you amaze me and it's crazy, but a boy can
Dream, girl 
Yeah and you're my dream girl

I'm speaking with my heart when my lips don't move
It's all that I can do
It skips like a record and it sinks like a stone as I fall for you

I wish you could hear me and I wish I was getting through
But it seems like every time we get close, all my systems go down
And I'm back where I started and for crying out loud

Dream girl, look my way
Baby, come and wake me, only you can make me
Dream, girl, dream this way
And you don't even know my name, oh
Dream girl, if you only knew 
How much you amaze me, it's crazy, but a boy can
Dream, girl 
Oh, you're my dream girl

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, this ain't just a phase or a trip that I'm on
Words ain't enough, so I wrote you a song
And it says

Dream girl, look my way
Baby, come and wake me, only you can make me
Dream, girl, dream this way
'Cause you don't even know my name

Dream girl, if you only knew 
How much you amaze me, it's crazy, but a boy can
Dream, girl 
Yeah and you're my dream girl
Baby, don't you come into my dream, girl, oh
And I can dream, girl
