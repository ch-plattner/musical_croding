
Who wakes you when the morning comes?
Who calls you every late night?
Who comforts you when you're in need?
And who always tries to treat you right?

Who gives you all he has to give?
And who would dedicate his heart to you
Who fulfills all his promises?
And who sees the good in you?

Tell me what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Oh, and where you're gonna go when there's nobody home?
And who's gonna love you when you're all alone?

Tell me what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Yeah what you gonna do when I'm gone?

I just wanna know

Who cries knowing you don't care?
And who worries what the future holds?
Who fears the road ahead
And whose heart is turning into stone?

Who prays for your safe return?
And who misses you when you're away?
And who's tired of empty promises?
And who's tired of all the games you play?

Tell me what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Oh, and where you're gonna go when there's nobody home?
And who's gonna love you when you're all alone?

Tell me what you gonna do when I'm gone?
I just wanna know what you gonna do, what you gonna do when I'mâ€”when I'm gone?

Tell me, what you gonna do?

Tell me, what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Oh, and where you're gonna go when there's nobody home?
And who's gonna love you when you're all alone, when you're all alone?
Tell me, what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Oh, what you gonna do when I'm gone?
I just wanna know, when I'm gone?

When there's no one home and you're all alone
Will you be just be fine alone or will you cry when I'm gone?
Wanna know, wanna know
Oh, what you gonna do when I'm gone?
Tell me, what you gonna do when I'm gone?
