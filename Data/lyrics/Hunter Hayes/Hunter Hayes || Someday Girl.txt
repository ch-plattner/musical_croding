
Yeah, here it goes
Oh, yeah

Everybody's got their someday dreamed up, mapped out
Gonna find somebody some way, but no one knows how
Been dreaming for a while myself and looking for my someone else
But I never thought I'd meet my someday so soon, this way

Hello heaven in green eyes, angel with the gypsy curls
Goodbye hoping and waiting, you're my someday girl
You're better than everything, you're sweeter than fantasy
Girl, when you look at me, I know
That you're my someday girl
Oh, and I found my someday girl

I'm thinking of a quiet place outside of the city
I'm gonna wanna spend some long days with you with me
Whenever and whatever we do, I just wanna do forever with you

Hello heaven in green eyes, angel with the gypsy curls
Goodbye hoping and waiting, you're my someday girl
You're better than everything, you're sweeter than fantasy
Girl, when you look at me, I know
You're my someday girl
Oh, and I found my someday girl

Been making our history, painting reality
Got words that got to be spoken
[?] gonna be, is right where we wanna be
But baby, my heart is wide open

Baby, I'm all yours
I found someday girl
Baby, you're my someday girl

Hello heaven in green eyes, angel with the gypsy curls
Goodbye hoping and waiting, you're my someday girl
You're better than everything, you're sweeter than fantasy
Girl, when you look at me, I know
You're my someday girl
I'm glad I found my someday girl, yes, I did
(You're my someday someday)
Oh, I'm so glad I found my someday girl
