
I was a ferris wheel,
in an empty field,
where nobody goes.

Had all the curtains drawn,
sitting all alone,
feeling like a ghost.

I was a broke down heartbreak,
badly in need,
of a little of love's electricity,

A busted carnival ride,
in the middle of the night,
then you flipped the switch.
You turned on the show.

You light me up,
like the fireworks flying on the 4th of July.
Yeah.
You light me up,
like a sunshine blazing in the summertime.
Oh, everytime.
You light me up.
Baby, you light me up.

You were the missing piece,
to my broken dreams.
You're bringing me back to life.

You look like a movie star,
just the way you are,
makes me burn inside.

Yeah, it's dynamite,
finally finding a match.
Baby, when you look at me like that.

You light me up,
like the fireworks flying on the 4th of July.
Yeah.
You light me up,
like a sunshine blazing in the summertime.
Oh, everytime.
You light me up.
Baby, you light me up.
Oh, you light me up.

Like New York City,
on New Year's Eve.
You light me up.
All the dark days left when you came to me.

Baby, you light me up,
like the fireworks flying on the 4th of July.
You light me up,
like a sunshine blazing in the summertime.
Oh, everytime.
You light me,
like the fireworks flying on the 4th of July.
Yeah.
You light me up,
like a sunshine blazing in the summertime.
Baby, everytime.
You light me up.
Baby, you light me up.
Baby, you light me up. 
Oh, you light me up. 
You light me up.
