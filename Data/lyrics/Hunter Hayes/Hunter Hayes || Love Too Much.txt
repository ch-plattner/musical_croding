Tell me where did we go wrong
If it's all good intentions
Why are we scared of living
Yeah the weight of the world
It's hard enough to hold already
Why does it gotta be so heavy
Maybe it's the little things
Maybe we can change the world
One heart at a time

You can't say you love too much
You can't say you care enough
There's no such thing as reaching too far
We all got a heart
And you can't say love too much
You can't say love too much

As simple as a word you say
You never know the lives you can change
Never know the souls you can save
And I bet it happens everyday
Cause everybody's got a story, a past, or a song of glory
Just take a look around
Somebody needs you now
You're somebody's hero somehow

You can't say you love too much
You can't say you care enough
There's no such thing as reaching too far
We all got a heart
No you can't say love too much
And no you can't say love too much

I can't sleep tonight
It's burning in my mind
If I could change the world one heart at a time
Oh, I'd start with mine

Yeah
(can't say, can't say)
Oh, you can't say
Oh, you can't say

You can't say you love too much
You can't say you care enough
There's no such thing as reaching too far
We all got a heart
No you can't say love too much
(can't say can't say)
No you can't say love too much
(can't say can't say)
