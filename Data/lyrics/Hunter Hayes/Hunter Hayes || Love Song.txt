Put on a love song girl I wanna sing along with you
Listen when I’m singing, hear every word I say
Look at me when I look at you baby, make the world go away

Cause baby I just want you to sing along, 
And all I wanna sing with you is a love song
Nothing bout hurtin, cheatin, losing baby there ain't nothing wrong
All I wanna sing with you is a love song

Let’s forget about the weather girl, ignore the rain
Cause the sun shinin in your eyes and I wanna stare all day
If the phone rings babe don’t answer it, let the machine take care of it
If the blues set in we’ll kick em out ain’t nothing allowed but love in this house

Baby I just want you to sing along, 
All I wanna sing with you is a love song
Nothing bout hurtin, cheatin, losing, baby there ain’t nothing wrong
All I wanna sing with you is a love song

Baby take my hand, I want you to understand what I want for you
(yeah yeah) don’t wanna let gone songs, hurtin songs, goin songs, cheatin songs get to you

Oh baby all I wanna do is sing along, 
All I wanna sing with you is a love song
Nothing bout hurtin, cheatin, losing, baby there ain’t nothing wrong
All I wanna sing with you is a love song
Baby, baby sing along
All I wanna sing with you is a love song
Nothing bout hurtin, cheatin, losing, baby there ain’t nothing wrong
All I wanna sing with you is a love song
