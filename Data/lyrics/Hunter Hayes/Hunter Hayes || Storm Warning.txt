Yeah
Oh no

She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat 5 kind keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'

Ain't it funny how it feels
When you're burnin' your wheels
Somewhere between goin' and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on

She's a heart full of rain,
Red lips like a flame
She's the girl from your favorite song

What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'

Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, gonna wish I had a sign
Or a storm warnin', yeah

Little heads up, little more time,
Little leeway some kind of sign would've been nice
Some kind of radar system,
If I heard it yeah I would've listened to the storm warning, to the storm warning
