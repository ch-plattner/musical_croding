
Well I've been searching for something true
My heart says it must be you
I'd love to fall and see it through
But only if you told me to

Well I'd run through the desert, I'd walk through the rain
Get you into trouble, and take all the blame
I'd paint you a picture, write you a song
And I'd do it all over if I did it all wrong
I don't wanna steal you away
Or make you change the things that you believe
I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah I could be so good at loving you
But only if you told me to

I've seen a lot of good love go to waste
And I don't wanna look back on these days
Knowing all the things you'd never know
If I never said a word and let you go
I don't wanna steal you away
Or make you change the things that you believe
I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah I could be so good at loving you
But only if you told me to (yeah)

I don't wanna steal you away
Or make you change the things that you believe
I just wanna drink from the words you say
And be everything you need
Yeah I could be so good at loving you
But only if you told me to

Maybe this is something I'll never be
But I'll be right here till you tell me
