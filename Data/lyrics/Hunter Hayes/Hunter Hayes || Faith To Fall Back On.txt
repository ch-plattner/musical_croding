
People know that love is what they want,
They get caught up and then it’s gone
They can’t get back the kiss they lost
They spend their whole life asking questions,
Not knowing what went wrong

But, then the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you’ve got left is being strong,
Gotta find a little faith to fall back on

I didn’t treat my girl like she was mine
Yeah, I thought I didn’t need her at the time
But I changed my way of thinkin’ when she left
Yeah, I finally learned my lesson, but I learned it by myself

Cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you’ve got left is being strong,
Gotta find a little faith to fall back on

These days I’m not sure if I know
What I’m doing here or where I’ll go
But, every night I say the same old prayer:

“God, I don’t have to see you. I know that you’re there
Cause there were times I thought I wouldn’t make it home
But I kept a little faith to fall back on.
Yeah, and I’ve learned to put my trust where it belongs
And I’ve gotta little faith to fall back on.”

Cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Oh, you gotta have a little faith to fall back on
Yeah, you gotta be strong. Yeah, you gotta be strong.
And find a little faith to fall back on.
