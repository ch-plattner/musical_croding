
You give me chances and I let you down
You waited for words that I couldn't get out
I have no excuses for the way that I am
I was clueless then, I couldn't understand

That all that you wanted 
And all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see

And I wish I could love you
And make you believe it
Because that all you ever wanted
It's all you ever wanted, 
From me, from me
Could I be selfish, or Lost in my pride
Afraid to be forward or just too scared to try
And now I'm without you, And it took distance to see
That losing you, means losing everything

When all that you wanted 
And all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see
And I wish I could love you
And make you believe it
Because that all you ever wanted
It's all you ever wanted from me

And is it too late and are you too far
To turn around and let me be... let me be

All that you wanted
And all that you needed
I'll show the side of me I never let you see
I wish I could love you
And make you believe it
Because that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted
And that's all you ever wanted
It's all you ever wanted
From me
Oh, from me
