The trouble with time is that you can't rewind it
You can't fast forward, you can't slow it down
The trouble with hearts is that they're always breaking
And they seem to like the trouble that they found
Oh, the trouble with tomorrow is it's always tomorrow
And the trouble with memories is sometimes they lie
The trouble with lonely is it sleeps right there beside you
The trouble with dreams is they never die

Oh, the trouble with love
It'll get you in deep, yeah, it always does
Oh, but the trouble's gonna find you
Everybody knows it's the best kind, too
Oh, that's the trouble with love
Oh, but I got no trouble with love
Yeah, I got no trouble with love

The trouble with me is that I'm always running
Hold all my secrets like I'm scared
Oh, the trouble with you is I can't say no
One little touch, I got no control
The first time, baby, I don't seem to care

Oh, the trouble with love
It'll get you in deep, yeah, it always does
Oh, but the trouble's gonna find you
Everybody knows it's the best kind, too
Oh, and that's the trouble with love
Oh, you know that's the trouble with love
Oh, I got no trouble with love

Oh, the trouble with love
You can have it all but you never get enough
Oh, the trouble with us
Is love's gonna get us in so much trouble

Oh, the trouble with love
It'll get you in deep, but you never get enough
Oh, the trouble's gonna find you
Everybody knows it's the best kind, too
Oh, and that's the trouble with love
Oh, but I got no trouble with love

Now I have no trouble with love
No, I got no trouble with love
Bring it on, bring it on, yeah
Bring it on, I got no trouble with love
