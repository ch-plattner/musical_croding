
When did you stop loving me
You let me down so perfectly
And you walked away so easily
Baby, tell me, when did you stop loving me

Tell me, when did you give up on us
Did I love too much or not enough
And is there someone else you're thinking of
And when did you give up on us

What do I do
With the mess you made of me
With all that I lose
I think you owe me one thing
No, I don't need your reasons
Or your sympathy
Girl, just tell me, when did you stop loving me

Tell me, when did you start drifting away
And have you loved me less
With every single day
If you were over me, girl, tell me,
Why did you stay
When did you start drifting away

What do I do
With the mess you made of me
With all that I lose
I think you owe me one thing
No, I don't need your reasons
Or your sympathy
Girl, just tell me, when did you stop loving me

I just wanna know
When did you stop loving me

Is this really how you want it to end
With a lie of love
And the loss of a friend
Now I'm scared of loving anybody else again
Is this how you want it to end

When did you stop loving me?

Baby, tell me, when did you give up on me
Did you give up on me
When did you give up
When did you give up

Oh, tell me, when did you stop
When did you stop
When did you stop loving me, yeah

When did you give up?
