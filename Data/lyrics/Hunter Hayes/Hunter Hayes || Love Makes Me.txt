
I tear the shrink wrap off
And put the needle down
Fill my bedroom up with a Cash song
And crank it up loud
Because it makes me feel good
Got the pedal pecked hard
And the Mustang drive
Horses screamin' at me
Momma prayin' that I'll make it home alive
But it makes me feel good
Like sneakin' out late
Tellin' white lies
Stealin' one more kiss tonight

I try my best to behave
And I can't help feelin' this way
It's not my fault so don't blame me
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
So what if I'm crazy
'Cause love makes me do it
Love makes me do it
Yes it does

Well it don't take much
I'm a sucker for the little things
Like the touch on my hand
And the sweet way she leans into me
Yeah, it makes me feel good
Yeah, it's a buzz how much I'm into this
No I can't get enough
Gotta have more than just one kiss
'Cause it feels so good
Yeah, watchin' her sleep
Stayin' up all night
Ridin' this heavenly high

I try my best to behave
And I can't help feelin' this way
It's not my fault so don't blame me
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
So what if I'm crazy
'Cause love makes me do it
Oh! Love makes me do it

I love so hard you think I'm stupid
But it's a fight that I don't mind losin'

I try my best to behave
And I can't help feelin' this way
It's not my fault so don't blame me
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
So what if I'm crazy
'Cause love makes me do it
I try my best to behave
And I can't help feelin' this way
It's not my fault so don't blame me
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
So what if I'm crazy
'Cause love makes me do it
