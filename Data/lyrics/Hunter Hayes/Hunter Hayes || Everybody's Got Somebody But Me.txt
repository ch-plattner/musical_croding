
I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

Well I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

I hear loves songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
Well I'm a good slow dancer but you'd never know
Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah they do

Everybody's got somebody....

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

Sitting here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me

Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you

But everybody's got somebody but me

Everybody, got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now

(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody has got somebody
(Everybody but me)
Everybody but me
(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody
I miss you
(Everybody but me)
Everybody's got somebody but me
