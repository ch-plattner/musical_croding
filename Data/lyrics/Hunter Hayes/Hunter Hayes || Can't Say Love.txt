She's got a smile of her own.
She's turning heads tonight.
She's super hero strong,
and that's her downfall sometimes.

She's rather leave alone,
and its like kryptonite.
If she tries,
so she'll never try.

She can't say love,
and run the risk of being wrong.
It hurts too much,
too find the edge and know you're jumping,
into something,
maybe nothing,
never could be,
wish it was,
love, love, love.
Ohh.
She can't say love.

First time for everything,
and this is mine.
Can't seem to say how I feel,
and say it right.

You've been locked up so long, 
but so have I.
When I try,
no matter,
how I try...

I can't say love,
and run the risk of being wrong.
It hurts too much,
to find the edge and know you're jumping,
into something,
maybe nothing,
wish it was,
love, love, love.
Ohhh,
but you can't say love.
No, I can't say love.

[guitar solo]

But you're falling into something,,
maybe could be,
everything you're looking for.
But you can't say love.
Oh no you can't say love.
You can't say love,
and run the risk of being wrong.
It hurts too much,
too find the edge and know you're jumping,
into something,
maybe nothing,
never could be,
wish she could be,
love, love, love

Yeah, you're jumping,
into something,
maybe nothing, 
could be never,
wish it was,
love, love, love, love.
Ohhh.

But you can't say love.
No, you can't say love.
You can't,
You can't,
You can't say love.
You can't say love.
