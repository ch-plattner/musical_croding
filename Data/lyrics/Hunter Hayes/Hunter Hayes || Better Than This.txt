
Whoa oh

My bags were packed from the day I was born
Knew there was something I was living for
I found my place in a runaway car
And I never looked back, never looked back

I never was much for falling in line
Had a long-time fire in this heart of mine
I may look crazy in momma's eyes but I don't mind

[Chorus:]
Could be a dead-end road
I could be chasing down a broken dream
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery
Oh and ain't life a trip?
No, it don't get better than this
No, don't get better than this

I kinda like it when I walk out the door
Not knowing what the good Lord's got in store
There's a freedom in believing there's something more
Yeah, one more chance, one more day
To say what I need to say

[Chorus:]
Could be a dead-end road
I could be chasing down a broken dream
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery
Oh and ain't life a trip?
No, it don't get better than this

Getting by on just a little sleep and coffee cups
Learning through the downs, living for the ups
All I know is that I feel alive, and it's a real good ride

[Chorus:]
Could be a dead-end road
But it's the only life I've ever known
No matter where this goes
You know I wouldn't change a single thing
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery
Oh and ain't life a trip?
No it don't get better than this
It's a trip and it don't get better than this
Oh, no, it don't get better, no

Hey!

(It don't get better than this) Yeah yeah yeah
(It don't get better than this) Oh no
(It don't get better than this)

It don't get better than this
