I didn't see it coming
The kiss was so unpredictable
And maybe it's the mystery
In you that I'm addicted to it
It's overrated knowing somebody so well
It takes away the fire

It's funny when you tell me you don't think you're all that interesting
I beg to differ, with you I'm out here on the edge of my seat
And every minute guessing, holding my breath you're fueling that fire

And baby you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark,
Shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free,
Just what I need,
Wild card

I'm an unsuspecting dreamer
Just marching through my every day
You don't follow any leaders
You make your mark, and make a change
You could see that I was living, oh
But baby now I'm living the life, yeah
You can blame it on the gravity
The reason that I'm falling
But the truth is I would jump
And girl you're everything I've wanted
It's a revelation,
Yeah, kind of elevation
Learning to fly

And baby you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark
Shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free,
Just what I need,
Wild card

You're my wild card
Got me happy like a holiday
Out of the blue been waiting on you praying for you everyday

And baby you're a sweet surprise
Looking like a superstar
You're a strong, free,
Just what I need,
Wild card

Oh baby, all I need, all I need
You're my wild card, baby,
You're my wild card
You're my wild card, baby,
You're my wild card
