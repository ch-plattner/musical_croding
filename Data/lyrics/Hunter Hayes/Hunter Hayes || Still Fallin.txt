
You would think for all the days I’ve known you
That I would have you memorized by now
With every question answered,
Every single page turned
But you just keep me on the edge somehow

And every day with you is still a mystery
The sweetest story's falling from your lips
And I hold on to every word,
Like it’s the first one that I’ve heard
It’s the only time I’ve ever felt like this

After all this time you’d think I’d be
Used to the pull of your gravity
But after flying so high for so long, who would think
I’m still learning, still burning, still falling
Still falling

I still reach for your hand because I need it
Your kiss is still the spark that lights a fire
You’re still laughing with me,
And we’re still making memories,
I’m still a fool for you, and there’s a million reasons why

After every late night street light drive
And every "Love you", "Miss you", kiss good night
Girl, your name is still my favorite
Always will be and I’m
Still wanting, still all-in, I'm still falling

Still falling,
Still chasing, still nervous,
Still reeling, dreaming about this

And after every sunrise holding you,
After all the crazy we’ve been through
Every day and every minute, girl, it’s something new,
I’m still learning, still burning, yeah, still wanting, still all-in, still falling.

Still falling.
