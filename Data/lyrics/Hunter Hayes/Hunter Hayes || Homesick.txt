I wake up every morning
in a house for two
But it's hard to say good morning
to an empty room

I talk to your pictures
like I'm talking straight to you
And I tell you that I love you
and I'll be home soon

This is what I come home to
day after day
An empty house, a lonely feeling
and a scary place to stay

When I say I'm going home
this can't be it
Cause if home is where the heart is
than why am I homesick

Well I search for the things
that complete my life
But I know my better half
is no where in sight

You're just a call away
anytime I choose
But it still won't put me
home to you

Ooooooooh

This is what I come home to
day after day
An empty house, a lonely feeling
and a scary place to stay

When I say I'm coming home
this can't be it
Cause if home is where the heart is
than why am I homesick

When I go to sleep
I'm right where I belong
Because I dream of you
and I'm finally home
