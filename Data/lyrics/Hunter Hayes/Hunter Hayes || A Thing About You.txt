
There's a painting hanging somewhere in Paris
Millions come over to stare at her
But she won't crack a smile, no

An Italian tower leaning like
It's had too much to drink
Still selling tickets like it's going out of style

[Chorus:]
But when I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
Because you're perfect girl
Oh oh oh oh
Every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh oh oh oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seeing through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you

Well, I go too fast, think too slow, I change like the weather
I know you could do better
I don't know what you see

You think your hair's too short, your eyes are too green
Girl I don't know what you mean
Not that you are but if you're asking me

[Chorus:]
When I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
Because you're perfect girl
Oh oh oh oh
Every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh oh oh oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seeing through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you

Every little imperfection only makes you you

And when I look at you I know there's nothing to improve, you're perfect girl

When I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
You're perfect girl
Oh oh oh oh
And every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh oh oh oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seeing through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you

No, I wouldn't change a thing
No, I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing, baby
I wouldn't change a thing
