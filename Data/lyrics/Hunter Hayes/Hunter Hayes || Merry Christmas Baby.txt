You sure do treat me right
Merry Christmas, Baby
You know you surely do treat me right

Oh, we both got diamond
Rings for Christmas yeah
I'm living in paradise
Baby I'm so lucky

I'm feeling real lucky this morning
Got Christmas music on the radio
I'm feeling real lucky this morning
Got Christmas music on the radio

I'm thinking maybe later I can sneak a kiss from you
Underneath the mistletoe oh yeah
Santa came down the chimney bout a
Half past three left lots of
Presents for my baby and me 

Merry Christmas, Baby
You sure do treat me so nice now
You got a diamond ring on your hand
I feel like I'm living in paradise

Santa came down the chimney 
Bout half past three left lots
Of presents for my baby and me

Merry Christmas, Baby
Oh, you treat me so nice 
You got me feeling everyday
Like I'm living in paradise

Merry Christmas, Baby [4x]

You got me feeling so good now
Like I'm living in paradise [3x]
