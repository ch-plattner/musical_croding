
Well if we had the words in times like these
We wouldn't have to stare
We'd both know what to say
And how to pray the things to do to save the day
Some will call it sacrifice
They'll look at this and never see
The beauty or how much it means
The blood that runs inside of me

I know you understand
That there's no map for this, no plan

And the way we say goodbye
Is not that way that anyone would do
Like a wave out on the ocean
I will always come right back to you
Like we blinked
Not a moment is gone
We'll pick up where we left off

It's like the world is draped in a camouflage
And sometimes never what it seems
Everyone's got different things
They hide behind or try to be
But the things I carry with me
All remind me who I am
When so much of me is not with me
What matters most is what I leave

Behind for you to keep
Yeah, so smile when you think of me

And though the way we say goodbye
Is not that way that anyone would do
Like a wave out on the ocean
I will always come right back to you
Like we blinked
And not a moment is gone
Yeah we'll pick up where we left off

Oooh
Oh

Oh the way we say goodbye
Is not the way that anyone would do
Like a wave out on the ocean
I will always come right back to you
Nothing changed, nothing fades, nothing lost
And we pick up where we left off.

Oooh
No
Oh
No
Oooh
Oooh
