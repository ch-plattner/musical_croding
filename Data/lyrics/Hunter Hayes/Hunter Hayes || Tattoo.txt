
I could spray-paint "I love you" on that bridge or in the sky
And I could swear when you say it to me, there's a good chance I could fly
And I might, it seems like, yeah,
If it's gonna be any night, it might as well be tonight

There's this thing that you do, you don't know that it does something to me, yeah
It's in the way that you sway, that you talk, that you touch, that you kiss, that you breathe
That I need, you look at me, girl
You're shaking things up like you wouldn't believe,
Crashing my comfort zone, setting me free
It's a "who'da thought?", "never dream" kinda thing

Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine, just saying
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, baby
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah

Would be a good tattoo

Ink it in on my skin, sign me up, make it last against the time
'Cause this is more than a picture that fades of a first date Friday night
It's unerasable, unmistakable, hey, everybody wants to know
Now I think I know, I'll wear it on my sleeve, I gotta let it show
Making it permanent 'cause I never wanna let you go

Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine, just saying
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, baby
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah

All my life, all I got is this one heart to give
All my life, all this time, I've been searching for this
Oh, and it looks like I found it
Yeah, I finally found it, girl,
It's you-oo-oo-oo

Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, yeah
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah

Would be a good tattoo

Only you, baby
Only you, no
Only you, now
