It's more like a mirror shows her all that's shes made of and what she never had
I know when she calls when nothing's going right
But if it were up to me she'd never have another lonely night

She's always dreaming of hearts and rockets
She's gotta fall before she can fly, and I, I wanna be the one she's falling for
Just wanna play my part in it
On every page she writes, her life, the story for hearts and rockets

I could tell her everything, but why if she doesn't want love
I'll keep it locked inside if, if she finds someone else, I'll just let it go
But I'll be left wishing, holding her hand
To secrets of a boy who's crazy about a girl who's always

Always dreaming of hearts and rockets
She's gotta fall before she can fly, and I, I wanna be the one she's falling for
Just wanna play my part in it
On every page she writes, her life, the story for hearts and rockets
(Yeah yeah)

She's always dreaming of hearts and rockets, she's gotta fall before she can fly
Always dreaming of hearts and rockets
She's gotta fall before she can fly, and I, I wanna be the one she's falling for
Just wanna play my part in it
On every page she writes, her life, the story for hearts and rockets
I just wanna be the one she's falling for
Yeah I wanna be the one she's falling for
