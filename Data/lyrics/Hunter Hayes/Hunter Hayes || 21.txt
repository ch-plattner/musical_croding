
Well, it's your birthday
Let's act like it is
And just go crazy
Do what we want with no reason why
Life ain't long enough
So let's celebrate
And get drunk on good love
Remember what it's like to just dance all night
We'll dance all night

[Chorus:]
That's the way that we're doing it, doing it
We go big or we go back home
People looking at us like we're losing it, losing it
But, baby, we ain't doing nothing wrong
Gonna be up all night
Chasing the sunrise
Like we're wild and young
Baby, kids on the run
Gonna party like we just turned 21

Let's treat this town
Like we own it
And baby, if you wanna get out
You can drive this car like you stole it
Like we're runaways, like we're superstars
Like we're fireworks burning in the dark

[Chorus]

Ain't nobody wants to act their age
Ain't no sense in us living this way
You and I, girl, we gotta get away
And make tonight the best night of our lives

[Chorus]

Oh, we just having fun
Yeah
