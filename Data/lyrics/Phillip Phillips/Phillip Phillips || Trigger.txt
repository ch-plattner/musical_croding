
I heard the words come out of your mouth again
So quietly you said
"I need someone to hold my heart again
Like it felt when I was just a kid"

Will you take me far away
From this fear that pulls me near?
Will you take it out?
What's inside of my mind, what's screaming out

Inside your hand it holds the question to it all
You start to pull the trigger, you start to pull the trigger
Inside your mind it goes where no one really knows
You start to pull the trigger, you start to pull the trigger

I saw the tears roll down from your eyes again
So softly they fell
I reached to you to wipe them off your chin
But you stopped me and said

"Please just leave me be.
I feel as though no one knows what goes on inside of me"
Then I turned to see it was too late to give you love
But it was too late to give you up

Inside your hand it holds the question to it all
You start to pull the trigger, you start to pull the trigger
Inside your mind it goes where no one really knows
You start to pull the trigger, you start to pull the trigger

And I saw how it all went down
You picked it up and threw it out
I saw how it all went down again

Inside your hand it holds the question to it all
I start to pull the trigger, I start to pull the trigger
Inside my mind it goes where no one ever knows
I start to pull the trigger, I start to pull the trigger
