You broke my heart and picked the pieces
Threw them in the fire to burn
Left me cold out in the rain.
But now I'm moving on without you baby
Without you by my side
I'm finally feeling free.

But I know that
The sun will shine for me
Even when the skies are grey
And I feel like I'm missing something
But the bridges build their own way

I know you've moved on without me girl
But I still think
How the time moves so fast
I still think of how the world
It goes around and round and round
But it all stopped when you said
Not for now, yeah, yeah

But I know that
The sun will shine for me
Even when the skies are grey
And I feel like I'm missing something
But the bridges build their own way

Like the ocean washes
The sand to the shore
You're like the sun that slips away
Lips that taste of an angel
And eyes that bring me to my knees
And a smile that could set me free
Just follow me
Just follow me
