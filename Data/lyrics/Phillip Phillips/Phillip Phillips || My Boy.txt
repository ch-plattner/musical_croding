Everything will be better now, my boy, my boy

Tell me your secret and say it loud
Let time stand still for just a while, just a while

It's hard to say what's in your heart
The truth can break it all apart, all apart

You can take it, time will make it clear, it's clear
And you can take it, the change you're making is here, it's here

Everything will be okay, my boy, my boy
Everything will be better now, my boy, my boy

So tell me now what you need standing there in front of me
So tell me can you see the one you want is the one you believe, you believe

You can take it, time will make it clear, it's clear
And you can take it, the change you're making is here, it's here

Everything will be okay, my boy, my boy
Everything will be better now, my boy
