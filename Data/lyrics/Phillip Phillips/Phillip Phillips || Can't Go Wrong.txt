I've seen the lights come from the flashes in the dark
I feel like a blind man trying to make a start
And I don't know, no I don't know
Where I'm gonna go

I've seen the sun come up a mile from the ground
Flew back the other way and saw it go back down
I know the days changed but always seem the same
I'll take the best of what I can from my mistakes
And now I know, now I know

I can't go wrong, as long as I remember where I'm from
Hold my head up just to keep it clear
I want a chance just to face my fear, face my fear

Nevermind all the times I just couldn't wait
I cant remember when it all began to change
Watching the grass grow and die from summer to fall
It's funny how the year passes by and you don't notice at all
I know, I know

I can't go wrong, as long as I remember where I'm from
Hold my head up just to keep it clear
I want a chance just to face my fear, face my fear

I can't go wrong, as long as I remember where I'm from
Hold my head up just to keep it clear
I want a chance just to face my fear, face my fear

I can't go wrong, as long as I remember where I'm from
Hold my head up just to keep it clear
I want a chance just to face my fear, face my fear
