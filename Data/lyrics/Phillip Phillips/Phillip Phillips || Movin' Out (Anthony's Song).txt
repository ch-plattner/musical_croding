Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"

Workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out

I'm movin' out

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center

And he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
Oh, you oughta know by now
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

Oh, and it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out

I'm movin' out

You should never argue with a crazy mi-i-ind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?

And if that's what you have in mind
If that's what you're all about
Good luck movin', ohhh
Yeah, 'cause I'm movin' out

I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
