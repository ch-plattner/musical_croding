Walked through the door
After day had turned its cheek
The letter that you wrote
Yeah, you left it here to read

Said this love's not just for you
It was also meant for me
Let me give you more to feel
Let me show you more to see

Tell me

What you're made of
My sugar and wine
Down from above
You make me so high
High, high

I'm much too young
But just hold on
I'm such a fool
Seeing it now
Saying it loud
You know it's true
That I'm just a fool for
I'm just a fool for you

Everyday I wake up
And I'm twisted in a dream
In between who I am
And the things I want to be

Then there you are raining down
Like water from a fall
You wash me down, dry me off
You keep pouring out your love

Tell me

What you're made of
My sugar and wine
Down from above
You make me so high
High, high

I'm much too young
But just hold on
I'm such a fool
Seeing it now
Saying it loud
You know it's true
That I'm just a fool for
I'm just a fool for you

I know it's alright my friend
You know it's alright my friend

I'm much too young
But just hold on
I'm such a fool
Seeing it now
Saying it loud
You know it's true
That I'm just a fool for
I'm just a fool for you
