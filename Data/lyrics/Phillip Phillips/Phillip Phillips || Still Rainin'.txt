
Clouds, one by one, fill the sky
Just like these tears that fill my eyes
I know by now she ain't comin' back, no
I watch my world slowly fade to black

Look out my window
It's still rainin'
Look out my window
It's still rainin'

They say that time heals everything
I know the pain that love can bring
It don't get no better with each passing day
Any hope I had is slowly slippin' away

Look out my window
It's still rainin'
Look out my window
It's still rainin'

Oh, no

I thought the morning would rescue me
But the rain keeps fallin' endlessly, endlessly, ohhh

Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me
There ain't much left of what I used to be, oh
Her love shone on me like the morning light
Now here I am alone again tonight

Look out my window
It's still rainin'
Look out my window
It's still rainin', still rainin', still rainin'
Look out my window
It's still rainin', oh
Look out my window
It's still rainin', still rainin', still rainin', ohhh
