Give me a ticket for an airoplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
My lonely days are gone, and I'ma goin' home
My baby wrote me that letter

O-oh

I don't care how much money I've got to spend
I just got to get back to my baby again
My lonely days are gone, and I'ma goin' home
My baby wrote me that letter

She wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see
Got to get back to my baby once more

Give me a ticket for an airoplane
I ain't got time to take that no-no-no-no-no fast train
My lonely days are gone, and I'ma goin' home
My baby, she wrote me that letter

Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see
Got to get back to my baby once more

Oh, give me a ticket for an airoplane
I ain't got time to take that no-no-no-no-no fast train
My lonely days are gone, and I'ma goin' home

Yeah, oh, my baby 
Oh, my baby wrote me that letter

Oh
