When the day is done, the weight is on my mind
How should I give up, how should I survive?
Leaning to the side of the busy street
Looking down, these people never notice me
Am I the only one who thinks it's hard to breathe?

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over
It's only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

Ten thousand faces here, but who am I?
Am I the only one with a reason to hide?
Searching through a maze only to find
Another wall to break, another wall to climb
It's when I lose myself, then I realize

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over
It's only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over
It's only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly
