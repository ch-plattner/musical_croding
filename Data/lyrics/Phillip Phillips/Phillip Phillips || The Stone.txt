I've this creeping 
Suspicion that things here are not as they seem 
Oh, reassure me 
Why do I feel as if I'm in too deep? 
Oh, I've been praying 
For some way to show them I'm not what they see 
Yes, I have done wrong 
But what I did I thought needed be done 
I swear

Oh, unholy day 
If I leave now I might get away 
Oh, but this weighs on me 
As heavy as stone and as blue as I go 
I was just wondering if you'd come along 
Hold up my head when my head won't hold on 
I'll do the same if the same's what you want 
But if not I'll go 
I will go alone...way 
Oh, from that fool's mistake and now forever pay 
No, run 
I will run, and I'll be ok 
Now I'm just wondering if you'd come along 
Hold up my head when my head won't hold on 
I'll do the same if the same's what you want 
But if not I'll go 
I will go alone

I need so 
To stay in your arms, see you smile, hold you close 
Oh, and it weighs on me 
As heavy as stone and a bone-chilling cold 
I was just wondering if you'd come along 
Tell me you will
