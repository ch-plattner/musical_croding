
Oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh yeah

I watch the world from the side of the moon
Looking at the stars, looking back to you
Just to see if you were still alive
Looking at the sun with the fire in your eyes

It's hard to know where I stand
Even the man on the moon couldn't tell me where to land
But, I wanted to fly in the sea with no gravity to pull me down

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
Cause the steps get bigger so we're here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away
Uh ooh
No no

So tell me this one thing
Now listen to me close
You steal from me but you call it your own
You liar you thief go make your stand on your own two feet
So oh now oh now listen what your friends say
Go now go now, go and do it that way
I'm the one you want to believe
But in your heart you can't see

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
Cause the steps get bigger so we're here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away

Oh let it fall, let it fall

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
Cause the steps get bigger so we're here to walk them all
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away
