
I didn't mean to let you down
I grabbed for your hand but you took it back
Trying hard not to let feelings show
Will only hurt you in the future when the cracks in your skin start to show

Paint a picture of an apple in a tree
Is that all that's there through the thicket of the leaves?
Yes, yes now you see
The bird flying out why don't you jump and see where he leads

Our love was just a dream, just a dream
With all my heart I gave you everything, everything
Oh and you know
That it all goes around and round
Cause you tumbled me down

Troubles seem to get to you
Brush them off, they're only worries, push on through
Hear the heart that beats for your soul
He who has nothing, should not complain, we all have something of our own

Our love was just a dream, just a dream
With all my heart I gave you everything, everything
Oh and you know
That it all goes around and round
Cause you tumbled me down

Was it wrong what I did to get to you
I felt I was the one to help pull you through
And I know, I know it's alright
I found a way out, I found a way out

Our love was just a dream, just a dream
With all my heart I gave you everything, everything
Oh and you know
That it all goes around and round
Cause it all goes around and round
