
Raindrop hits the edge of the times it comes more
From the porch to the ceiling makes its way down to the floor
But I won't worry you won't see I'm right by you, and you by me
As we wake up tonight as the thunder roars

The staircase can never teach me more
Like life I climb, I fall, just a step once more
You tricked me, fooled me, I was yours
Only to act out a game that I did not know

Who am I...who am I anymore?

Who am I, who are you, what are we anymore?
Just the darkness in my life like a hole in the floor

Won't you take it all away and I'll take mine to the lord
The angels may fall but never close enough to let me soar

The eagles are flying and crows are dying
I Guess I'll jump quick just to see if I still have a chance to live
I played around and around, I win but a circle grows old
I guess I'm just another square in this circled world that we call home

Who am I....who am I anymore?

Who am I, who are you, what are we anymore
Just the darkness in my life like a hole in the floor

Won't you take it all away and I'll take mine to the lord
The angels may fall but never close enough to go in my head

Who am I, who are you, what are we anymore
Just the darkness in my life like a hole in the floor

Won't you take it all away and I'll take mine to the lord
The angels may fall but never close enough to let me soar
