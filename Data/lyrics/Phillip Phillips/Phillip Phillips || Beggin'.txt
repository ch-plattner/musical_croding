I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high when I was king
Played it hard and fast cause I had everything
Walked away, wondering then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Will leave it standing, devil's dancing with my soul

Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black

Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, oh
Beggin', beggin' you, oh, come on, ohh
Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, oh-oh
Beggin', beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, darlin', ohhh

Come on, come on

Beggin' you

Beggin' you

Beggin', put your lovin' hand out, oh-oh
