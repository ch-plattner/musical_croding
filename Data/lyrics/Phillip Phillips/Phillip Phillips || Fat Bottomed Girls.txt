
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round

I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Oh

I've been singing with my band
Across the water, across the land
I've seen every blue-eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them lovely ladies every time

Oh, won't you take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, and you give it all you got?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round

Oh, now I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality, no
But I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Hey, big woman, you done made a big man out of me

Oh, you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round, yeah

Fat bottomed girls, hey, hey

Fat bottomed girls, oh, oh

Oh, hey, mmm, mmm
