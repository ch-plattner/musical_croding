
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you
And do all the things I told you in the midnight hour
Oh, yes, I am

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
See them twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You're the only girl I know
That can really love me so, oh, in the midnight hour
Oh, in the midnight hour

I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
Oh, 'cause you're the only girl I know
That can really love me so, oh, in the midnight hour
Oh, in the midnight hour
Oh, in the midnight hour

Oh, in the midnight hour

I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour

That's when my love come tumbling down
When there's no one else around

Do all the things I told you in the midnight hour
