
I see you in my dreams
Seems like you never leave
You are the blur in my eyes
As I wake up through the night

Ten thousand hands can't hold
This heavy heart of stone
I feel it break like glass
Still I keep coming back

So pick me up then throw me down
Shine the light then turn it out

You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on

And I'll follow wherever you go
Right down that rabbit hole
Then everything gets dark
And I feel pulled apart

Running through my blood
You are the rarest drug
With every word I breathe
I see the way you've changed me

Around then throw me down
Shine a light then turn it out

You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
So lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on

Paint the road to see the way
Should I go or should I stay
I'll come around again
I'll come around again

We never learn to let it go
Always feel it as you grow
It comes around again
It comes around again, so

Lead on lead on and I'll follow
Lead on lead on
And I'll follow you into the night
Let's get lost until it's light

You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on
