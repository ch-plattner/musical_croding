
We are dead to rights born and raised
We are thick and thin 'til our last days
So hold me close and I'll surrender to your heart
You know how to give and how to take
You see every hope I locked away
So pull me close and surrender to my heart

Before the flame goes out tonight
Yeah, we'll live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?
Come out, come out, come out
'Til we lose control into a raging fire
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?

You know time will give and time will take
All the memories made will wash away
Even though we've changed, I'm still here with you
If you listen close, you'll hear the sound
Of all the ghosts that bring us down
Hold on to what makes you feel
Don't let go, it's what makes you real

If the flame goes out tonight
Yeah, we'll live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?
Come out, come out, come out
'Til we lose control into a raging fire
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?

Let the world leave us behind,
Let your heart be next to mine
Before the flame goes out tonight,
We can live until we die

Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?

Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?
Come out, come out, come out
'Til we lose control into a raging fire
Into a raging fire
