
Now, you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
Till you come home, babe, till you come home
Now, you taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, baby, I'm all alone

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, oh baby, ohhh
Give a little more, oh baby, ohhh

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby, ohhh
Get a little more from you baby, ohhh

Now, you were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, oh baby, ohhh
Give a little more, oh baby, ohhh

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby, ohhh
Get a little more from you baby, ohhh

I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
I cannot pretend
I never want to feel this way again

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love, no-no
I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not gon' fall in love
Till I get a little more, oh baby, ohhh
Get a little more from you baby, nooo

I'm not falling in love with ya
I'm not gon' fall in love with you no more
Till I get a little more from you baby, ohhh
Get a little more, get a little more, get a little more
From you baby
