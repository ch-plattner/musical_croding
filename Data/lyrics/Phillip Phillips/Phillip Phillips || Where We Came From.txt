
I must've used up all my wishes yesterday
Cause the words were said in anger still echo in my brain
Alone through the darkness in this cave
I wanna hear you whisper
Hang on every word you say

Climb the mountain, swim for shore
Bring it back to how it was before

Take it out, blow it up
Ignite the memory in between us
Through the storm and all the dust
Take it out of these walls with a cannonball
But don't let it go, don't give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from

I connect the stars to build a map to you
In the empty space we're dreaming
Will we still know the truth

Climb the mountain, swim for shore
Bring it back to how it was before

Take it out, blow it up
Ignite the memory in between us
Through the storm and all the dust
Take it out of these walls with a cannonball
But don't let it go, don't give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from

Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh, ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh

So climb the mountain, swim for shore
Bring it back to what it was before

Take it out, blow it up
Ignite the memory in between us
Through the storm and all the dust
Take it out of these walls with a cannonball
But don't let it go, don't give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from
Just trying to remember where we came from

Don't let it go, don't give up the ghost
While staring at the moon and the sun
Just trying to remember where we came from
