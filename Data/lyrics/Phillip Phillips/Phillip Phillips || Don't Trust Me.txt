
I don't believe, I don't believe
What just happened, it seems
Like clouds of rain just poured out on me
The light was much further I could see
But it's too late now I'm gonna make it through these clouds

Clouds hide behind what can't be seen
Just the darkness holds us up, you and me
The dice keeps rolling it never stops on what I need
So I'll change the game, let's see where that takes me

You've gotta live to know who you are

I wanna be the one you run to
When your dreams won't leave you alone
Out in this night you run to your head
But your head won't even hold you
On top of this world, in this life you think you've got it all
Then you look up at the stars
And realize where you are
So dream boy, dream boy
And see where you find yourself in this life

You've gotta live to know who you are

Tell me I'm wrong
Beg me please
I've gotta find out if it's really me
Who I believe
So when I say I'm okay
Don't trust me

I wanna stand on top of the mountain
Shine more than the sun brings out
To each of us each is a key we hold
So why don't we unlock the treasures that we long for
Every fall you catch, every thought you forget
Don't let it slip through your hands to let the next one catch
Everything that was coming your way
Don't let it all start to slowly step away

You've gotta live to know who you are

Tell me I'm wrong
Beg me please
I've gotta find out if it's really me
Who I believe
So when I say I'm okay
Don't trust me
