Lonely in a room no sound to fill your soul
Hopes and dreams, the house will glow who can't let go
But you can only see when I look into your eyes you pull me in too deep

Take me in take me out till I'm nothing more than words spoken from your sweet sweet mouth
And dance around like no one can see baby
Move your body with the rhythm, move your body next to me

Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away
Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away

One step too, and I'm sinking in your lies
Only to see the truth hidden behind your evil eyes
And no likely me to the ways of you
Is it me or am I lone it's all such mystery

Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away
Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away

Wanted is love

Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta seek everything you love before it's gone away

Wanted is love, now go and sing
You know you gotta seek everything you love before it's gone away

Wanted is love
Wanted is love
