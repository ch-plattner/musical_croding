
When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
Everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, messed around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Baby

U got it, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up, and you call right back
U got it, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
Know u got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else

When you say that you love 'em
But you don't really know
Everything used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all, babe)
Flowers, cards and candy (Do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you

All my people who know what's goin' on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies, say I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

See, I've been there, done it, messed around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That u got it bad, no, no, no

You're on the phone
Hang up, and you call right back
U got it, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
Know u got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else

U got it, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up, and you call right back
U got it, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know u got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else

U got it bad, oh
