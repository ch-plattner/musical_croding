
I remember, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space

And when you're out there without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But remember to think twice, 
That's my only advice

Come on, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think you are,
God bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Does that make you crazy?
Well, I think you're crazy
Well, I think you're crazy
You're just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their life out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be just like them
I remember, yes, I remember when i was young,
And there's no coincidence I have come
And I can die when I'm done

Well, I think we're crazy
Well, I think we're crazy
Well, I think we're crazy
Don't you think so to?
