Lying in the grass wishing clouds were closer than that seem
the love of him that makes her laugh all the worries fall away
having a mind full of thoughts that will never deceive us.
In his eyes she falls in the ocean deep in green.
If the time she'll make it by with the fear in her heart not wanting to be broken again.
lying in the dark all alone but with the loudest sounds
heart beating breaking walls, oh just to find the line. 
Sing a word of how she feels no 
and kissing his lips so she knows everything is real. 
Kissing his lips so she can sleep and dream her dream. 

Watching the time pass by slowly in his mind 
just the thought of wondering if breathing can still keep him alive 
words have no meaning when she's in his eyes 
waltzing around the world hiding behind the smile. 
If this time he'll make it by with the fear in his heart not wanting to be broken again.
Lying in the dark all alone but with the loudest sounds heart beating breaking walls 
oh just to find the line. 
Sing a word of how he feels no 
kissing the lips so he knows everything is real. 
Kissing the lips so he can sleep and dream his dream.

You never find what you're looking for
but keep searching for something that's more than you can ever dream.
Trying to find who we are out of all this madness
and praying to God to take you away won't you take my hand and I'll take yours, darling.
and We'll make it through this. Follow the loud.
