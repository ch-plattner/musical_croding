I know it's all there
Why don't you open up and let me in?

Take it out of your head
Take it out of your thoughts
Cause when you find what you've been missing
I'll be lonely my love, my love

You know it's all here
Why don't you open up and let me in?

I'll take it out of your head
I'll take it out of your thoughts
Give you a reason to stay, give you a reason to not

Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door

I found what you need
Come on and give me what I want, a taste of you with me
The further I go, the closer you seem
Why won't you leave me alone, why won't you leave me be?

Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door
[x2]

When you find your way back in
Darling, I won't give my heart again
[x4]

Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door
