It’s close to midnight and something evil’s lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You’re paralyzed

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one’s gonna save you from the thing about strike
Thriller, thriller night
Nobody for your life inside a killer, thriller night

You hear the door slam and realize
There’s nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you’ll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you feel the creature creepin’ up behind
You’re out of time

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain’t no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
Thriller, thriller night
You’re fighting for your life inside of killer, thriller tonight

They’re out to get you, there’s demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night I’ll save you from the terror on the screen,
I’ll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
‘Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, thriller, thriller night
You’re fighting for your life inside of killer,
Thriller tonight
Thriller tonight
