Find out what's there, something new to conceive
Get up, get down, get a little bit closer to me
Find out what's there what you can be

Yesterday was our time to turn back again
And instead we went through the fire to get lost in sin
Burn, baby, burn let me cool you down again
Turn, baby, turn to see where it all begins

'Cause it's alright, it's out there
Go and get lost, girl
It's alright, I'm out there
Let me take control

Get up, get down, move a little bit closer to the scene
Find out what's there, something new to conceive
Get up, get down, get a little bit closer to me, girl
Find out what's there what you can be

Walk it off but keep it on
Let it take control of every cell inside your body,
Each and every bone
Burn, baby, burn -- let's cool it down again
Turn, baby, turn to see where it all begins

Yeah, it's alright, it's out there
Go and get lost, girl
It's alright, I'm out there
Let me take control

Get up, get down, move a little bit closer to the scene
Find out what's there, something new to conceive
Get up, get down, get a little bit closer to me, girl
Find out what's there what you can be

Na na na na na no
Na na na na na no
Na na na na na no

Get up, get down, just a little bit
Get up, get down, just a little bit
Get up, get down, let's get lost in this merry-go-round and round

Na na na na na no
Na na na na na no
Na na na na na no

Get up, get down, just a little bit
Get up, get down, just a little bit
Get up, get down, find out what's there, find out, baby, it's you and me

Get up, get down, move a little bit closer to the scene
Find out what's there, something new to conceive
Get up, get down, get a little bit closer to me, girl
Find out what's there what you can be

Get up, get down, move a little bit closer to the scene
Find out what's there, something new to conceive
Get up, get down, get a little bit closer to me, girl
Find out what's there what you can be
