
I see myself again
Behind the light I flicker
My shadow starts to bend
Into the night like a whisper

Because of you
It's never the same
Because of you
The darkness fades

Higher and higher
Like a flame on fire
I feel alive again
Desire, desire
Burning brighter and brighter
I feel alive again
I feel alive again

Throw out what makes me thin
But the harder I try, it lingers
You see it through the rain
On the other side it shimmers

Because of you
I'm not afraid
Because of you
I've burned a page

Higher and higher
Like a flame on fire
I feel alive again
Desire, desire
Burning brighter and brighter
I feel alive again
I feel alive again
[x2]

I feel alive again
I feel alive again
