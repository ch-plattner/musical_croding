
Take one step and make it count
Hold your breath then let it out
What's left unsaid, say it loud
There's a fire in me
That's still burning

I'm sending out a searchlight
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight
To bring you back to me

I'm lost again in this night
The sun just leads me into shadows
In my bones, in my blood
You cure my disease
Like a remedy

I'm sending out a searchlight
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight
To bring you back to me

Like a wild river
In a hurricane
Like a fallen empire
I will rise again
Take one step
And make it count

I'm sending out a searchlight
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight
To bring you back to me
