
Like a fall leaf from a tall tree
Landing on the grass
Like the white sand turns the clock in
Any hour glass
You're the reason I believe in
Something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so,
You make it so easy
This letting go is so beautiful,
Cause you make it so easy,
To fall so hard, to fall so hard

Like the ocean pulls the tide in
Just to hold it close
Like the rain pour in a rainstorm
Makes the flowers grow
You're the reason I believe in
Something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so,
You make it so easy
This letting go is so beautiful,
Cause you make it so easy,
To fall so hard, oh oh oh

You make it so, you make it so,
You make it so easy, nooooo

You make it so, you make it so,
You make it so easy
This letting go so beautiful,
Cause you make it so easy,
To fall so hard, oh oh oh

You're the reason I believe in
Something I don't know...
