The sun rises over the trees again
As for the moon it pushes through the stars and
You tell me go, I say it's alright my friend
For the moments we have in this life they will end

I see who you are but don't believe
You show a side you claim to be

So open your eyes, open your heart and then
Watch it fall out, watch it align and bend
For all that you've done
And for all that you've shown
It's not too late to let it go
Cause it's all yours

Watching the change, seeing the phase within
Our bodies they age and our spirits grow thin
You hear the sound of winter's breeze so quietly
So live for this day, hold it and wait 'til morning gives

I see who you are but don't believe
You show a side you claim to be

Open your eyes, open your heart and then
Watch it fall out, watch it align and bend
For all that you've done
And for all that you've shown
It's not too late to let it go
Cause it's all yours

Open your eyes, open your heart and then
Watch it fall out, watch it align and bend
For all that you've done
And for all that you've shown

Open your eyes, open your heart and then
Watch it fall out, watch it align and bend
For all that you've done
And for all that you've shown
It's not too late to let it go
It's not too late to let it show
Cause it's all yours
