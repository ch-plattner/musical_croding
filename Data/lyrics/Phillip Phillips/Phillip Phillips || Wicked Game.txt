The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
No, I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love, no
No, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love

What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you

No, I don't wanna fall in love, no
No, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love

No, I don't wanna fall in love, no
No, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange how desire make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love, no
No, I don't wanna fall in love
This world will break your heart
Nobody's falling in love

Nobody's falling in
Nobody's falling in love
No, no no, woah, no, no, no, no
