
Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

Forever, forever love
Together, together love

You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

Forever, forever love
Together, together love
