
Wait a minute, baby.
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire

Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing
And undoing the laces
Undoing the laces

Said, Sara
You're the poet in my heart
Never change
Never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Then call me home

Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there
Ask me and I'm there, I care

In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then, please, call me home

Sara
You're the poet in my heart
Never change
And don't you ever stop
Now it's gone,
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Sara
Sara

(There's a heartbeat
And it never really died, it never, never really died)
Oh Sara,
Would you swallow all your pride
Would you speak a little louder
Singing, all I ever wanted
