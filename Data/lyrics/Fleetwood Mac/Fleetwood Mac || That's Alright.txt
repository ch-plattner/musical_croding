
Meet me down by the railway station
I've been waiting
I'm through waiting for you
Train sings the same kind of blues

Well, I don't know why I always trusted
Sometimes I think that I must have
I must have been crazy
Crazy to wait on you, baby

Turned around and got pushed down, baby
Now I decided yesterday that I would leave you
I'm alright

Please, I've been takin' my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
That's alright
That's alright

I believe, I believe that I know you
But we've been a long time
Now I've got to show you, that I
Well, I never did believe in time
You know, changin' anybody's mind

Now, I can't define love like it should be
That's alright
It's alright

Please, I've been takin' my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
'Cause that's alright
Ooo yes, that's alright
