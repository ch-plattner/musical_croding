
Now, when the day goes to sleep
And the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks

Don't you come creepin' around
Makin' me do things I don't wanna do
Can't believe that you need my love so bad

Come sneakin' around tryin' to drive me mad
Bustin' in on my dreams
Makin' me see things I don't wanna see

'Cause you're da Green Manalishi
With the two prong crown
All my tryin' is up all your bringin' is down

Just takin' my love then slippin' away
Leavin' me here just tryin' to keep from followin' you
