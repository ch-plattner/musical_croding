
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you

For every voice you ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you
Oh, yeah

For every voice you ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you

I ain't waitin'
I ain't waitin'
I ain't waitin'
...
