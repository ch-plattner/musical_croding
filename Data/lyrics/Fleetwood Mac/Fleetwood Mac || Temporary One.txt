
Where are you darlin', when my
Moon is risin', and your
Sun is shinin' down

What are you doin', are you
Missin' me
The way that I'm missin' you now

[Chorus:]
The river goes on and on, and the
Sea that divides us is a
Temporary one, and the
Bridge will bring us back together

What are you doin', goin'
Down in to soho as i
Take my rest tonight

What are you doin', are you
Busy with your world
Well I wish you were busy with mine

[Chorus x4]
