
Until she herself
Became the deadliest poison 
As she grew older
Ooh, until she herself
Became just as fatal
As was her garden

And so you run toward
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers
To cut down
With all the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around...

Never did I mean to (never did I mean to)
Imprison you (imprison you)
Here in my garden (here in my garden)
Like I am imprisoned (like I am imprisoned)
All the love I have for your life
All the love I have for your life
Turn around (turn around)

Until she herself
Understood her garden
Leaving her heart broken,
No future at all
Until she herself
Became the toxic garden
Always frightened,
No future at all

And so you run towards
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers
To cut down
With all the love I have for your life
With all the love I have for your life
Turn around...

Never did I mean to (never did I mean to)
Imprison you (imprison you)
Here in my garden (here in my garden)
Like I am imprisoned (like I am imprisoned)
All the love I have for your life
All the love I have for your life
Turn around (turn around)

So you run towards
What you know is wrong
But there are too many flowers
To cut down
With all the love I have for your life
With all the love I have for your life
Turn around...

Running through the garden, 
I'm running in brilliant colors
I'm running straight toward, straight toward
What you know is really wrong
Too many flowers here to cut down
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

For the love I have (for the love I have)
For the love I have (for the love I have)
Turn around...
