
When I see him, I feel him
There's an intenseness
In him, in his eyes
He wants me to be with him
He wants me with him now
'Cause she just seems to be missin'
How could that happen anyhow?

So how can you say
Well I don't know what love is?
You haven't and you have no time for it
You feel completely different
You feel pushed up against the wall
And then one day it just almost goes away
You spend lots of time alone and
Sometimes you spend years
And you miss those arms that used to go around you

Night after night
No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, every time
Well it's hard to be civil
And it's real hard to be nice
But you did it my love every time

So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until' it's right
Not until'
None of us is pushed up against the wall
I don't know, the wind doesn't get you anymore

So today she says, "Well I've changed my mind"
"That's a woman's right", they say
Well I'm frightened and I'm lost and I
Can't give you up, not now I need you now
I'm broken-hearted
Broke down like a little girl
Well I need you now, well I'm broken hearted
Well I broke down, like a little girl

(I need you now, no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
(I need you now, no questions asked)
I broke down like a little girl
(Need you now, no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
Like a little girl
(Need you now no questions asked)
Like a little girl
