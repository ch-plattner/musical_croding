
You are here and warm,
But I could look away and you'd be gone.
'Cause we live in a time,
When meaning falls in splinters from our minds.
And that's why I've travelled far,
'Cause I come so together where you are.
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be married
All of the things that you say are very...
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
Now you are here today,
But easily you might just slip away.
'Cause we live in a time,
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme.
And that's why I've travelled far
'Cause I come so together where you are.
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be married
All of the things that you say are very...
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
You are here and warm,
But I could look away and you'd be gone.
'Cause we live in a time,
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives.
And that's why I've travelled far,
'Cause I come so together where you are.
Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be married
All of the things that you say are very...
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,
Sentimental lady, gentle one.
