Come on baby, could you ever be
Just a little close to me
Ooh ooh ooh
Could we ever forget tonight?
Come on baby, let's take a stroll
You're feelin' warm so don't be cold
Ooh ooh oh
We'll never forget tonight
What a wonderful night to be
The stars must be my friends
To shine for me.
Come on baby, now don't you be cold
Just remember that love is gold
Ooh ooh
We will never forget tonight
