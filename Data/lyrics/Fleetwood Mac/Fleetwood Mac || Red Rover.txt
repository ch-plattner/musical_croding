Why do you come around
So very much 
You know it just brings you down 
It's just something you can touch 

You don't belong here 
I guess you never did 
Whisper, look up, in your ear 
You just keep it so well hid 

Anyone at all 
Could see what was missin' 
Could see you were dyin' 
But no one was cryin' 

And I did hear what you said 
Now I can go home 
All my days are blue 
All my days are bright 

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover 
We come, we come, we come, we come 
To take you over (ah) 
Take you over (ah) 
Red rover (ah) 
Take you over (ah) 

One of the quiet ones 
One of the few 
Now fall down onto your knees 
Show us all what you can do 

We came around here 
To see if you were well 
And there's nothing for you to fear 
In Heaven or in Hell 

Anyone at all 
Could see what was missin' 
Could see you were dyin' 
But no one was cryin' 

And I did hear what you said 
Now time to drive home 
All my days are blue 
All days bright 

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover 
We come, we come, we come, we come 
To take you over (ah) 
Take you over (ah) 
Red rover (ah) 
Take you over (ah) 
Red rover (ah) 
Take you over (ah) 
Red rover (ah) 
Take you over (ah)
