You like a man with a future
You like a woman with a past
Well do you really believe that
She said to the faces in the crowd

[Chorus]
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else

And even if you did miss me
You never let me know
You'd prefer to be just a little bit
In and out of love with me
And not to scream and shout
You'd prefer to be just a little bit
In and out of love with me

[chorus]

Come on now let sad winds blow down
As the rain came...she refused to wear her coat
But deep in her heart she knew
That the song must go on

He says well I have forgotten you
And your beautiful eyes
We were off the wall
We were mirrors of our former selves well

You could have said no
You could have said well I just can't
Woah we were off the wall
We were mirrors of each other...passing by

[chorus]

Well I was your paper doll...paper doll
Well I was your paper doll...paper doll
And it doesn't even matter
It was a real clear answer
