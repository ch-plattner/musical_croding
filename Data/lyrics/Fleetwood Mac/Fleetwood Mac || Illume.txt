Illume says the candle that I burn
A reflection in the window
All the way to Point Dune
Illume-like it dances
I am a cliff dweller
From the old school

I like the coastal cities
I like the lights...
I like the way the ocean blends
Into the city at night
Like living on a working river
This coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake 
In a black sky

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade you for jade
Or for diamonds
Not for one minute
Not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted
That I was just so scared

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadows of a stranger

What I saw on this journey
I saw history go down
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
It's just like a river
Ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away

Because it's just like a river
It's never ending
It's just like a river
It's never ending

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
How we could get out
What we've been through
And all of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

(What I saw on this journey... I saw history go down)
(I cannot pretend...that the heartache falls away)
(It's just like a river...ooh, it's never ending)
(I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away)

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
How we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadows of the strangers

What I saw on this journey, what legends are made of
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
No, I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
Falls away...like a river, it's never ending...
La la la la... la la la la...
La la la la... la la la la...
