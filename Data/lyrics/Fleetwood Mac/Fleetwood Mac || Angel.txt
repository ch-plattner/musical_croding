Oh how I wish I was back in Georgia
Maybe I want, to be back in time
I've got a sweet lot of memories, of another place
And a heart full of longing, for another life
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
Angel, I want to see you, right now
Oh how I wish, I could see an angel
Deliver me from, this dark dispair
I've got a sweet lot of plans that have come to nothing
And a life that's in need, of a good repair
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
You know I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you, right now
Under a sky, of gun metal grey
No omens in sight for all around
Just living alone, with a hope that someday
I might see and angel arise, to take me down
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, Lord I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
Angel, Oh I want to see you, right now
