
I do come from miles away,
Ain't got no place to stay.
Glad to help you plow your fields, 
Farmer's daughter.
Might be just a couple of days, 
Clean up, rest, and be on my way.
Thank you, madam, much obliged, 
Farmer's daughter.
So long, got to leave your land.
Many thanks, it was might grand.
I do hope to see you again,
Farmer's Daughter.
Farmer's Daughter.
