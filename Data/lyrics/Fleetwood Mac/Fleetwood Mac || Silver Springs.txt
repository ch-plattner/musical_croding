
You could be my silver springs
Blue green colors flashin'
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby, I don't wanna know

I'll begin not to love you
Turn around, see me runnin'
I'll say I loved you years ago
Tell myself you never loved me, no
And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby, I don't wanna know
Oh, no
And can you tell me was it worth it
Really, I don't wanna know

Time casts a spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me

[Instrument solo]

Time casts a spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me
I'll follow you down til' the sound of my voice will haunt you (on 3rd time
Stevie oversings, was I such a fool?
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you
[3x]

You could be my silver springs
My blue green colors flashin'
