
At the end of the day 
The end of the light 
She keeps the remains of all of her foes 
Miranda is dying with all of her might 
She never comes 
She always goes 

She sticks the camera right into her arm 
Anything to forget what the trouble's about 
It causes her pain, 
That's part of the charm 
She's down for the count then finally out

Miranda is taking the stars down 
A little something to call her own 
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone 

She sees her face in another magazine 
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight 
Can't stand to be loved, 
But she loves to be seen 
She slips down headlong into the night 

Miranda is taking the stars down 
A little something to call her own 
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone 

And then all at once the sun starts to rise 
She sees her father holding her down 
All the daylight is poison to her eyes 
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown 

Miranda is taking the stars down 
A little something to call her own 
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone 

The lights shine down the marina 
All across her safety zone 
But loneliness follows Miranda 
And Miranda is always alone 
Miranda is always alone 
Miranda is always alone 

Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
