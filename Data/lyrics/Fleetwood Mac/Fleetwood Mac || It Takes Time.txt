
Baby, I've just been holding out too long
Maybe I couldn't admit I was wrong
And maybe I've just been lying to myself
And no one else

Slow down, baby
Cross that line
If you want to save me
It takes time
It takes time

Maybe I've wasted all this precious time
I'm trying to prove what is and isn't mine
Wondering to myself if you knew
It was all for you

Slow down, baby
Cross that line
If you want to save me
It takes time
It takes time
It takes time
It takes time
