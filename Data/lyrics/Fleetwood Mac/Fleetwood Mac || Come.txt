
Think of me, sweet darlin' 
When everything is going bad 
Think of me, sweet darlin' 
Every time you're feeling sad 
Think of me, sweet darlin' 
Every time you don't come 
Can you feel the fever? 

Think of me, sweet darlin' 
Every time things get rough 
Think of me, sweet darlin' 
When the best just isn't enough 
Think of me, sweet darlin' 
Every time you don't come 
Can you feel the fever? 

'Cause nobody else is doing it, whoa 
And nobody else is doing it, no no 
Where's the harmony? Where's the humanity? 
Love, was a little too scarce 
Hey, hey, ooh yeah 

I said I was going before it got away 
She's been here a while 
Living in the guest room 
I guess she goes in style 
I said I was going before it got away 
But I just can't let her go 
Can you feel the fever? 

Now I lay me down to sleep in this enemy bed 
Tomorrow morning I will wake up 
Hurting from the things we've said 
One thing leads to another 
But I guess you know about that 
Can you feel the fever? 

'Cause nobody else is doing it, whoa 
And nobody else is doing it, no
Where's the harmony? Where's the humanity? 
Love, was a little too scarce 
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah 

'Cause nobody else is doing it, yeah 
No, nobody else is doing it, doing it, are they now, now, now? 
Where's the harmony? Where's the new harmony? 
Love, it was a little too scarce 
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah 
Take it! 

Think of me sweet darlin' 
Every time you don't come
