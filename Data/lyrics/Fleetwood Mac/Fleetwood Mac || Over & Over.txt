
Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now

All you have to do
Is speak out my name, yeah
And I would come running
Anyway

And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?
Over and over

And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?

Don't turn me away
And don't let me down
What can I do
To keep you around

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
