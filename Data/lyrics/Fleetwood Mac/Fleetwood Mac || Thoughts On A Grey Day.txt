
I thank my God
For perfect love and peace
I'll hold her tight
And always
Mine forever
Love, love
So great
So divine
Trees - the grey day has changed everything
It's beautiful, just beautiful
So beautiful this first grey day is ours
My loving child
By grace of God we live, my child,
And love
I crawl to my knees, my dear love
Will you promise to kiss 
My perfect healing hands
And fingers
And make a promise to me you will always obey 
My each command and never, ever fail me
You'll be mine forevermore
The sun is here
My love
My love
My sun
Our sun complete.
God bless our perfect, perfect grey day
With trees so bare, so bare!
But O so beautiful, so beautiful!
The grey and blue sky
The world is here
Ours, just, justing, just ours
Our own
Hold us tight
I am yours, just a dream
And go on dreaming
May this joy of ours 
Never ever cease
My love, my love
Pregnant sweet
Love is tender
