
Station Man
I've been waiting
Can you tell me
When we're leaving

Midnight train
Now is leaving

Engines screaming
Uh-huh, Uh-huh
Uh-huh, Uh-huh
Where I'm going I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving I don't know
But you tell me now...

I see it's coming
And bringing something
This train of lovin'
I see it's coming
I hear it's running
This train of loving
From ages past...

Station Man
I've been waiting
Can you tell me
When we're leaving
