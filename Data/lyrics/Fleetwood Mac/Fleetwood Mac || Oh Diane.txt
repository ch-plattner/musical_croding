Oh no, here I go again
Fallin' in love again
Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand
Oh, oh, whoa...
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane
Will I love you, I will, always
Will you stand by me always
Cause Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand
Oh, oh, whoa...
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane
(Talkin' 'bout Diane)
Oh, oh, whoa...
Oh, oh, Diane
Oh, oh, Diane
(Talkin' 'bout Diane)
Oh, oh, Diane
