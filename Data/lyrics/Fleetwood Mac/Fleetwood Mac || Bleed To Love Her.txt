Once again she steals away 
Then she reaches out to kiss me 
And how she takes my breath away 
Pretending that she don't miss me 

Ooh, I would bleed to love her 
Ooh, bleed to love her 
Ooh, I would bleed to love her 

And once again she calls to me 
Then she vanishes in thin air 
And how she takes my breath away (breath away) 
Pretending that she's not there 

Ooh, I would bleed to love her 
Ooh, bleed to love her 
Ooh, I would bleed to love her 

Somebody's got to see this through 
All the world is laughing at you 
And somebody's got to sacrifice 
If this whole thing's gonna turn out right 

Ooh, I would bleed to love her 
Ooh, bleed to love her 
Ooh, I would bleed to love her 
Bleed to love her 
Bleed to love her
