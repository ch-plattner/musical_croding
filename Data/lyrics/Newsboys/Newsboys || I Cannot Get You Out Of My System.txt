Oi. Boy. Got a new gig?
It's jammin' your brain
like a too-tight wig.
Stuff this new religious phase.
Your home is here
in the yellow haze.

Oi. Boy. What are you doin'?
Wearing your faith like a new tattoo when friends and formers
don't approve this.

(Steelo pads will not remove this.)

[Chorus]
I cannot get you, I do not want
you out of my system.
I cannot get you, I do not want you
out of my head.

Oi. Boy. What are you on?
We'd try to help you but you're
too far gone.
First we thought you'd be rejecting us.
Now we're scared you'll start infecting us.

Oi. Boy. Come again.
Someday soon it'll all sink in,
as all your efforts to inspire us
spread like some computer virus.

[Chorus]

Always stalled by hidden fears,
always stuck in neutral gears
until I gave the driver's seat away.
Take my life and make it real.
Turn the key and take the wheel.
Push the throttle through the floor,
evermore...

[Chorus]
