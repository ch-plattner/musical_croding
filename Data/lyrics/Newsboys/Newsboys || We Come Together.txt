
Waiting.
We're waiting for apologies,
and we're waiting.
We're both expecting sympathies.

Another hour is gone.
We sulk and carry on
so stubborn-hearted.

Waiting.
We're marking secret borders now,
and we're waiting.
We're in our separate corners now.
We wait for night to fall.
We can't even recall
what got this started.

[Chorus]
Now is the time and here is the place,
'cause we lose these hours
and casting blame
when we should be saying grace.
We can find a better way.
We can stand on common ground.
We can work this out
between us before the sun goes down.

We come together.

Waiting.
We don't know what
we're trying to prove,
but we're waiting.
Until the other makes a move
we stick to our facades.
We only speak in nods and sullen glances.
Waiting. Our shadows just get longer now.
We need to start again before this day
has stolen all our chances.

[Chorus]
