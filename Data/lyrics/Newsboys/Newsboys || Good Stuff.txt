If I tell you something you need to know
I gotta back it up
I gotta let it show
We can be so loud
We can write a song that makes us all proud
But without love
It's just a sound

Everybody show what we know
And let that good stuff flow
Everybody show what we know
And let that good stuff flow

I could speak with tongues of Angels
Apologetics in a slick rhetoric
Either way without love my words are dead
We have love
We have forgiveness
We have grace without a limit
So if it has been revealed to us
Should it not then be contagious?

We got the rhythm
We got the rhyme
Print up a t-shirt
Throw them a line

But without love we are nothing
