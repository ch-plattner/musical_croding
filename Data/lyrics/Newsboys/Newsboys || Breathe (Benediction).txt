
When all is said and all has come undone
When the sun, the moon and stars grow dark
Before the days of youth are left in vain
Before the dust reclaims its own again

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of God
Breathe on me
'til my heart is new
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of Life
Breathe on me
'til I'm resting in you

When all is said and all has come undone
Restore the promise I made when I was young
Now unto Him who can keep us from falling
And present us faultless before His glory

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of God
Breathe on me
'til my heart is new
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of Life
Breathe on me
'til I'm resting in you
