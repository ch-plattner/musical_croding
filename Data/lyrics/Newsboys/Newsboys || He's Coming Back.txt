Things are getting tough
You got to hang in there
When you're just about to quit, let God be God
When your back is against the wall
His love will be true
When you're feeling two feet tall
Stand upon the rock

[Bridge]
Don't you be afraid for He is with you
Don't you be afraid for He is with you

[Chorus 4x]
He's comin' back like he Promised He would
Let's be ready when the trumpet sounds

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Bridge]

[Chorus 4x]

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Bridge]
