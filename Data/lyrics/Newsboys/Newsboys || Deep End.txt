
She's diving down
Gonna make her home now
The ocean
She's done with living her life
On the ground
She's sinking down
Hands above her
Held her
Nineteen years
And now their letting go
Tomorrow will be 'round
And everyone will see
No tragedy
It's like it's over
But it's just begun

She's going off
The deep end
Breaking from the crowd
She's way in over her head
I think she's gonna drown
She's going off
The deep end
The search is over now
She's falling into your hands
It's all or nothing
There's no guessing
She's been lost and found

She's diving down
Scars on her elbows
The wind blows
An old song spins around inside
'how sweet the sound'
To be living
And dying
Looks like it's over
But it's just begun

To take this step of faith
Don't need to be scared
Turn worry into wonder
Dissolve the fear
She's steppin' out
And you drop the blame
As she speaks the name
Above all other names

To be lost and found
Her world has turned
Upside down
Her soul restored
With salt like rain
From all of the things
That you forgave
And all the times she'd disobey
She's diving in the ocean of your grace
