Mom & Dad,

I'm fine. How are you? I have joined a
Small circus (that much is true). I'm a
Little malnourished, but try to relax.
Could you find a better photo for the milk
Carton backs?

Send money.

Runaway
Where's your head?
Dreamers' dreams
Are grounded

[Chorus]
In reality
That comes from above
God is calling
There's no bigger love
It's his reality that welcomes us back
Trust and obey
There is no other way

Mom & Dad,

I'm fair. How's life? Lent the money you
Sent me to the clown with the knife. My
Career as an acrobat hasn't begun, but
I'm busy giving blood and shoveling
Elephant dung.

Send money.

Runaway
Why so tense?
Dreamers' dreams
Will make sense

[Chorus]

Runaway
Blowing smoke
Your folks are worried
(and going broke)

After the fall
Is an all-new episode
Reality
Is the high road

[Chorus]
