
All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bringing forth the Royal Diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bringing forth the Royal Diadem
And crown Him Lord of all

Ye chosen seed of Israelâ€™s race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all!
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all!

You're Lord of all!
You're Lord of all!

Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all!
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all!
And crown Him Lord of all!
And crown Him Lord of all!
