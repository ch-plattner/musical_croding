Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning my song shall rise to thee.
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee,
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise thy name, in earth and sky and sea.
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity.

You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy
You are holy, holy, holy
