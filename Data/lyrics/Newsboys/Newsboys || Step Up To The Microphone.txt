I say hello
To anyone who's listening
Put on a show
If that's what makes your ears prick
This microphone
Will take a word and make it bigger
Oh hello
So here goes

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
If you don't know
Then ya need to be told!

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
I said hey boy
It's a narrow road

I say hello
To anyone who's listening
The message ain't nothing new
I don't decide what's true
So when the stones get thrown
They either miss or
They turn to glory
Here's the story as far as I know

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
If you don't know
Then ya need to be told!

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
I said hey boy
It's a narrow road

Steppin' up
I don't step alone
The question is "how do we know
What we know"
The answer is so plain to me
So here I go
Tap the mic "test 1, 2, 3"

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
If you don't know
Then ya need to be told!

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
I said hey boy
It's a narrow road

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
If you don't know
Then ya need to be told!

Steppin' right up to the microphone
I say hey man!
There's only one way!
One God one body one faith alone
I said hey boy
It's a narrow road
