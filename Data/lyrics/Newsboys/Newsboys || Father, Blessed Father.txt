
Will You take what we have
A sacrifice unto You
Then create clean hands
And, Lord, make our spirits new

Father, blessed Father
Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
'Til we see Your face

Let us hear what You say
Let us know Your voice and all of Your ways
Take our hands, lead us home
To the refuge that we find in You alone

All adoration
To our Lord Redeemer
To our Shepherd
Who carries us forevermore

Breathe on me
Breathe, oh, Breath of God
(Breathe, oh, Breath of Life)
Breathe on me
'Til my heart is new
Oh Lord, oh Lord
'Til my heart is new
