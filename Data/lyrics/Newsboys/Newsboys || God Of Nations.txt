
God of all nations
Lord of creation
It's in the bonds of love we meet
We come together at Your feet

Equal in Your sight
Made one by Your might
You've called us to restore Your lands
And place them back within Your hands

[Chorus:]
So tonight
Be glorified
Be magnified
As every nation lifts You high
Oh, Father, tonight
It's our desire
To see Your kingdom shine
On earth as in heaven tonight

God of all nations
Lord of creation
Your purpose is our hope, our bread
All You've planned and all You've said

Lord of the heavens
Lord of the ages
The church You build shall never fail
No gate or border will prevail

[Chorus]

Tonight
Be glorified
Lifted up high
It's our desire
So tonight
Be glorified
Lifted up high
It's our desire
Oh, Father, tonight
It's our desire
You're magnified
Lifted up high

[Chorus]

All be glorified
