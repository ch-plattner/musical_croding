I see the neon lights
As they light the city sky
I see a desperate boy
At the monment that he cries
I see him reaching out
His hand is to the sky
I'm telling you don't let go
God is on your side

[Chorus]
Hold on tight, never let Him go
Hold on tight, hold on

I feel the innocence
He's washed my sins away
I'm not afraid of the future now
His will is here to stay
Reach out and hold on tight
He's with you all the time
I'm telling you don't let go
God is on our side

[Repeat Chorus]

Keep on reaching out to Him
He's with you all the time
Don't ever let go
God is on your side

[Chorus]
