
I'm a marinade
Of what's hot this summer
I'm an early comer
Bought a Gulf War Hummer

Every fad, I feel its force
Every trend, I do endorse
Got my genomes mapping
Caught my smart dog napping

I'm charging up the new, new thing
(I'm riffing on the new, new thing)
I'm answering a customized ring
I'm starting from the place you stop
I'm packing for an ego trip...hop

Stop the scam
You day traders in a traffic jam
Can the craze
All you players outta plays
Fight the man
All you suckers for a better brand
They got us livin' off the fad o' the land

Get your pager on
'Cause you know my number
I'm a wireless wonder
Got thumbs of thunder

Soul daddies in a fire wire tumble dryer
Soul mamas broke the breaker
Soul children packin' Prozac pacifiers
Get your plug-in
We all need to plug into our Maker
