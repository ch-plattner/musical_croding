
When you got there
I was sure you'd come too late
We all pay you lip service
Then address our prayers to fate
Sister gone
She tripped and fell
A prodigal hell
And do I dare believe you'll reach
Such a long lost cause
Wrapped in gauze
As good as dead

She's breathing...

My Lord
She's a miracle child
I know
She's a miracle child
And I saw
How she'd chosen the grave
My Lord
It's a miracle save

When she woke up
We were dumbstruck at the sight
Like coming out of a coma
All she asked for was more light

Fluttering eyes
Life from a tomb
You flooded her room
With a fearsome mercy
Torn from the devil's grip
From the clutches of fear
I can hear her dead heart beating

My Lord
She's a miracle child
I know
She's a miracle child
And I saw
How she'd chosen the grave
My Lord
It's a miracle save

We lose hope
We mumble our prayers
We seal off the stairs
And never dare believe your reach
Can pass through stone
Can lead a child home
Can make the dead start blinking
