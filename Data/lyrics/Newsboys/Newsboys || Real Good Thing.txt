[Chorus]
When we don't get what we deserve that's a real good thing
When we get what we don't deserve
That's a real good thing

Born to sin
And then get caught
All our good deeds
Don't mean squat

Sell the Volvo
Shred the Visa
Send the cash to Ma Theresa
Great idea
The only catch is
You don't get saved
On merit badges

[Chorus]

Doctor's coming
Looking grim
"Do you have a favorite hymn?"

Check your balance through the years
All accounts are in arrears
Guilt is bitter
Grace is sweet
Park it here
On the mercy seat

[Chorus]
