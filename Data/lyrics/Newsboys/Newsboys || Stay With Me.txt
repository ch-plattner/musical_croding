
When I think of love
I think of You
When I think of You
I think of forever
I'm like a child in Your arms
I feel so loved by You

[Chorus]
Stay with me a while
Stay with me a while
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me a while
Stay with me a while
Oh, stay with me
You are my heart's desire

We walked the desert night
I felt Your fire strong
Your glory comes to me
Living water will set me free
Pour out Your Spirit now
Eternal springs, heal me

[Chorus]
You are my heart's desire

Stay with me
We can walk the furthest mile
Water me
For you are my heart's desire
Stay with me
We can walk the furthest mile
Water me
For you are my heart's desire
Whoa

[Rap/Bridge]
The fountains of the world
Are so bitter to me,
But the water that You give
Flows so generously
When You give it so freely,
It will never end
For there's not
A broken heart
That Your love can't mend
I traveled to the East,
Back to the West
And discovering Your love
Was an answer to tests

Stay with me a while
Stay with me a while
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me a while
We can walk the furthest mile
You are my heart's desire
You are my heart's desire
I am Your own
