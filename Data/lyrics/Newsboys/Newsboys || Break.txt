But my fear is it's too late
Won't go making no trouble
'cause I feel like I could break

All of those times I ran away
From all of those things I used to say
All of those plans I had
To give it all

And I feel like I could break
And I feel like I could break
Now it's more than I can take
And I feel like I could break

Don't go thinking I'm crazy
But I'm feeling your heartache
Your creation through your eyes
There is pain it's no mistake

Closer I get to you I see
Souls full of hurt, full of need
The closer I get I see less of me

And I feel like I could break
And, I feel like I could break
Lord, I know now it's getting late
Let my heart be broken by your heartache
And I feel like I could break
Now, it's more than I can take

'cause all of those times I ran away
From all of those things I used to say
And all of those pains I feel
Revealed to me

Don't go thinking I'm crazy
But I feel like ...
