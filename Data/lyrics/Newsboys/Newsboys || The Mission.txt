
When the runners came from Bethlehem
All breathless with good news
They were passing a baton forward through time
The commission, from God's lips to our ears
Carried by his saints two thousand years
Connects us all to the same lifeline
As I fix my eyes ahead
I can feel the spirit's breath...

(AND) I CAN HEAR THE MISSION BELL RINGING OUT LOUD AND CLEAR
IT'S THE REVOLUTION JESUS STARTED, AND IT'S HERE
ECHOING ACROSS THE WORLD FROM THE SHORES OF GALILEE
I CAN HEAR THE MISSION BELL CALL FOR YOU AND ME
I WANNA RUN WITH FIRE
IT'S MY HEART'S DESIRE
LIFTING YOUR LOVE HIGHER

In the history of our faith's arrivals
Great awakenings, Welsh revivals
Saints and martyrs, summoned by a new birth
Patrick's save of the Irish nation
William Carey's expectation
Lambs & lions
Called to the ends of the earth
Gotta put my hand to the plow
Not looking back, not now...
