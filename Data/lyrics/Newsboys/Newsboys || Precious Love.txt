Like a moth drawn to the flame
I am drawn to the mighty name of Jesus
Like a deer that pants for water
My heart cries out to You to fill my life with all of You

[Bridge]
It's You I want to strengthen me
For all the days of my life

[Chorus]
How could I have ever lived without Your precious love
How could I expect to carry on
You give love that soothes fire that burns within my soul
And You will always send it 'round my way

Through a shadow will pass away
Your love for me will stand the test of time
When You fill me with Your water
My hands reach out to You to touch my life with all of You

[Bridge]
It's You I want to strengthen me
For all the days of my life

[Chorus]

Lord, I pledge the highest
The highest that can be from a heart

[Bridge]
It's You I want to strengthen me
For all the days of my life

[Chorus]
