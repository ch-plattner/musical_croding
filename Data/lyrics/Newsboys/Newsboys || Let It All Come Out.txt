
Who, who's touched you child? Now you can't feel a thing, not anything
Who's been the one telling you lies? Now you'll believe anything

OH YOU GOTTA LET, LET IT ALL COME OUT
LET, LET IT ALL COME OUT
RIGHT NOW
RIGHT NOW

How, how many fires, to make you feel pure again, alive again?
And what will it take, what has to break, for you to begin again?
What will it take?

[Repeat Chorus]

Lift yourself out of it all
Come out from the shadows to the sun
Oh you gotta lift yourself out of it all
Yesterday's over, a new day's begun
You're only sick as all your secrets
Let them all come out, let them come
This devil came to steal your name away
This devil came to give your name away

OH LET, LET IT ALL COME OUT
LET, LET IT ALL COME OUT
LET, LET IT ALL COME OUT
RIGHT NOW
RIGHT NOW
