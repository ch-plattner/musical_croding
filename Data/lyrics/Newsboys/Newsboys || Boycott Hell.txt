
We've gotta job to do.
We're runnin' out of time to do it.
You've got a gift to use.
Get out in the world and use it.
Bury your foolish pride.
We've gotta unionize.
Hey, don't you think it's time
to boycott hell?
Boycott hell.

We've got the strength to win
standing arm in arm together.
Forget our differences,
we can change the world forever.
Bury your foolish pride.
We've gotta unionize.
Hey, don't you think it's
time to boycott hell?

Don't let a neighbor go,
form a holy picket line.
We've gotta let them know.
Don't you think it's time
to boycott hell.

[Rap by Steve Taylor:]
Guess who comin' through
with a little disclaimer.
Tune's OK but the words
are gettin' lamer.
Ain't no saint can legitimitize.
Rhymin' "pride" with "time" with "unionize".

See I agree we oughta boycott hell.
But we oughta boycott
dumb lyrics as well.

Don't let a neighbor go,
form a holy picket line.
We've gotta let them know.
Don't you think it's time
to boycott hell.

We've got a job to do.
We're running out of time to do it.
You've got a gift to use.
Get out in the world and use it.
Bury your foolish pride.
We've gotta unionize.
Hey, don't you think it's time
to boycott hell.

Boycott hell.
