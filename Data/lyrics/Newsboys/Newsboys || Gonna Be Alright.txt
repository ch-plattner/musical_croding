
Inside me there's a child afraid of
Growing up and letting go
Inside me there's a world of danger
Could you pull this whole thing down
'Cause inside you there's much forgiveness
Endless love unconditional
And inside you there's a world of favor
Rising up (and) breaking through

OH IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
ALL THESE THINGS WILL HAVE THEIR TIME
OH IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
ALL THESE THINGS WILL FIND THEIR TIME

Inside me there's a child afraid of
Moving in and getting close
Inside you there's a world of healing
Ever free.....so dangerous

[Repeat Chorus]
