[Verse 1]
This here comes breakin' in
Like brick to glass
Like grace to sin
Gonna kick down walls like West Berlin
Shout an amen
Hug it out, then
This here's gonna light a fire
Gonna pink slip preaching to the choir
Gonna send us hobbits outta the shire
Here's the theme song
Get your ring on
That there's still propagating, waiting on a rooftop
Our journey's just begun...

[Chorus]
COME HERE, A LITTLE BIT CLOSER
I WANNA TAKE YOU TO A SECRET KINGDOM
IT'S HERE SPINNING OUR WORLD AROUND
TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN
THIS HERE IS BIGGER THAN SHOW BIZ
IT'S GONNA SHOW US WHAT THE GOOD NEWS REALLY IS
THIS HERE IS SPINNING OUR WORLD AROUND
'TIL WE'VE GOT NO FEAR

[Verse 2]
This here won't be contained
By culture, wars and trendy names
Been there, done that, wore out the t-shirts
Don't need free perks
Don't need knee jerks
This here still wakes the dead
Still gets God's people Spirit-led
Gonna put in action all we've read
Not all enraged, just all engaged
'Cause that there's still fabricating kingdoms out of boxes
We're gonna leave that slum

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
This here wants faithfulness, not easy fixes
This here won't shrink to fit no politics, yeah
This here knows whistles make for better mixes

[Chorus]
