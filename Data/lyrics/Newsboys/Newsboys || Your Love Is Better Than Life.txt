
I dunno nothing that I haven't been taught,
I dunno why I was born into the family I've got,
I dunno if I ever had an original thought,
maybe not, maybe so, maybe later, I dunno
I dunno how I can end a prayer, then turn on a friend,
I dunno what I was thinking when I just pressed send,
I dunno why I still criticize the things I dunno
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno, but this one thing I know

YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm just a broken machine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, it's all a mindless routine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm in another free fall
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I've got nothing at all

I dunno what goes down the moment we die
Do we get halos & harps? Do we sleep? Do we fly? I dunno
how, when and why this world will finally end,
Speculation's gonna grow, who knows best, I dunno
I dunno if I should push ahead or stop and grieve,
I lie awake and wonder how to make a city believe,
I dunno when it's a ministry and when it's a show
maybe neither, maybe both, I dunno, but this one thing I know

YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm just a broken machine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your touch I'm not a full human being
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
If I should ever leave, where would I go?
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
I look to you 'cause you're the lover of my soul

HERE'S TO THE LOVER OF MY SOUL
HERE'S TO THE LOVER OF MY SOUL

I dunno when to walk away or stand and fight
just when I've got it wrong, I'm sure I heard you right
and when my arguments are watertight you expose every hole with a flash and a flood and I know
I hear you call in the eye of the storm and I know you've had my back since the day I was born still
stoking my heart
still stirring my head
you're my pillar of fire
you're the wine, you're the bread, and

YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm just a broken machine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, it's all a mindless routine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm in another free fall
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I've got nothing at all

YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
I dunno nothing that I haven't been taught, I dunno why I was born into the family I've got,
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
I dunno if I ever had an original thought, maybe not, maybe so, maybe soon, maybe later, I dunno
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
I dunno when I've got it right or wrong, I dunno how I can wrap it in a four minute song, but I know
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
My grip is better when I'm not hanging on, your love is making us strong (all along)
Your love is better than life
