
If you're sinking
If you're losing control
And your heartache has taken it's toll
If there's things you've never thought before
Like you're all alone
Afraid that love won't come home

You will find me
I'm at the point of your breaking
Behind all the noise
When your world is
Darkest I can still see
Cause when there's nothing left
I'll be

I'll be

Like a small town
Talk is getting around
Now that you've found
A friend can still bring you down
And when their faith in you comes crashing down
Know that I'm still yours
I'll be the hope that endures

You will find me
I'm at the point of your breaking
Behind all the noise
When your world is
Darkest I can still see
Cause when there's nothing left
I'll be

I'll be the light to help you find
All the things you left behind
Wondering will love come back
I'll be whispering you're still mine
When loneliness invades your mind
You're gonna be all right
You will find me
I'm at the point of your breaking
Behind all the noise

You will find me
I'm at the point of your breaking
Behind all the noise
When your world is
Darkest I can still see
Cause when there's nothing left, yeah
Cause when there's nothing left
I'll be
