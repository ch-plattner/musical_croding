
I lift up my voice
To The King, The King of glory
I hold out my hands
To The One who is worthy
I long for Your presence
I long, Lord, I need Your touch

[Chorus:]
Come, oh Lord, and fill up my life
With the light of Your presence
This is my heart's desire
Oh Father, come and let Your spirit abide
I long for Your presence
This is my heart's desire

I long to be washed
In the well of Your mercy
I long to be warmed
By the fire of Your glory
I long for Your presence
I long for Your healing touch

[Chorus:]
Come oh Lord and fill up my life
With the light of Your presence
This is my heart's desire
Oh Father, come and let Your spirit abide
I long for Your presence
This is my heart's desire

It's my desire

(I wanna feel Your presence)
Lord, it's my desire
(I wanna feel Your presence)
Lord, You're my desire
(I wanna feel Your presence)
I wanna feel Your presence
I wanna feel Your presence
I wanna feel Your presence - Jesus

[Chorus:]
Come oh Lord and fill up my life
With the light of Your presence
This is my heart's desire (this is my heart's desire, oh...)
Come and let Your spirit abide
I long for Your presence (presence...)
This is my heart's desire (this is my heart's desire, oh...)

Come oh Lord and fill up my life (fill up my life)
With the light of Your presence
This is my heart's desire (this is my heart's desire, oh...)
Come and let Your spirit abide
I long for Your presence
This is my heart's desire

It's my desire

Lord, You're my desire
Lord, You're my desire
