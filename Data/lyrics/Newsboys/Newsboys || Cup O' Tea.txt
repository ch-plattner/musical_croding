
"KICK START" - his overdue life as a star
Waiting tables hadn't done that so far
"SPOTLIGHT" - a dream for many a year
The leather jacket, Jimmy's ever ready stage wear

Sorry I'm not your cup o'tea
But I don't mind
Yeah, I said I don't mind
At least I know you're thinking about me
Yeah, I don't mind
Yeah, I said I don't mind

"GOOD STUFF, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY HEAR!"
Mumbled something 'bout "PEARLS IN A PIG'S EAR"
"OLD SCHOOL" thirty two and knowing it all
Who wants to listen to a single-sided phone call?

Sorry I'm not your cup o'tea
But I don't mind
Yeah, I said I don't mind
At least I know you're thinking about me
Yeah, I don't mind
Yeah, I said I don't mind

Bring it all into perspective
The tongue will steer the ship ahoy
Spark up a flame
Feel the pain of habanero sauce
A word's forever
When we speak we set 'em free
So watch your mouth
And you be careful what you say, Jimmy

Sorry I'm not your cup o'tea
But I don't mind
Yeah, I said I don't mind
At least I know you're thinking about me
Yeah, I don't mind
Ahh, maybe I do mind
