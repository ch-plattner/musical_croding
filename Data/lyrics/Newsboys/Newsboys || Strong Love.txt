
He swings to the left,
she leans to the right,
but that doesn't make a flight a given.
And some pitch their tents in the middle
of the fence, but it doesn't matter
where you're living.

His spirit's in me his spirit's in you,
so there's a common bond between us.
And the mission for me is a mission for
you - we have a common cause to link us.

[Chorus]
Strong love yeah, people.
Strong strong love between us.
Strong love yeah, people, and you know
it's true that it always must be there.

He worships while he grooves,
she prays and barely moves,
but they're both reflecting pure devotion.

And some go for broke like headless chicken-folk
(inspiring jokes about pultry-in-motion).

His spirit's in me, his spirit's in you,
so there's a common bond between us.
And the mission for me is a mission for you -
we have a common cause to link us.

[Chorus]

Now don't just agree and then wait on history -
this is not a duty-free abstraction.
Divisors get blurred and the message
gets heard by puttin' Jesus' words in action.

It's a master design it's a millionwatt sign.
You can see it shine like patent leather.
It's a way people see how heaven's
gonna be when we live in unity together.

[Chorus]
Strong love yeah, people.
Strong strong love between us.
Strong love love yeah, people,
And you know it feels like
it always will be there.
