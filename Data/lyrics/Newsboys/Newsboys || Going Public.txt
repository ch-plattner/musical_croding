
She's been dazed and induced
Wants a part-time God
For the private use
But she won't take a stand
'cause she might get tagged
As a closet Jesus Fan

[Chorus]
SIGN ON
THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR
THIS IS SURELY A BANNER YEAR
TO BE A PUBLIC WITNESS
SIGN ON
THE LINES ARE DRAWN AND CLEAR
THERE'S NO STRADDLING FENCES HERE
WE'RE GOING PUBLIC WITH THIS

He's displaced and unglued
Scared that faith in God
Could be misconctrued
But the cross makes him wish
That this spine was more
Than a school of jellyfish

[Chorus]
