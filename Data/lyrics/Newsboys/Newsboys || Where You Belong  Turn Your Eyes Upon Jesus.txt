
When you're dull from all that glitters,
when you're thoughts have a hollow ring,
when you can't escape from the fact you
are getting it wrong...

All your foolproof plans seem foolish,
all your status is status quo,
all your really need to know
is where you belong.

[Chorus]
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
Look full in his wonderful face.
And the things of earth will grow
strangely dim in the light
of his glory and grace.

I was used to the cold for so long
that I couldn't feel anything.
And I shivered and stared like a beggar
who won't lift his hands.
I was numb until he touched me.
I was deaf until he heard.
I was senseless 'til I met the one
who understands.

[Chorus]
