
I wrote you a letter
Things could be better
Full of promises, every hope and dream
Did you get it
Have you read it
Talks about you and me
And the future, you see
Something no one can do
Is take the place of you
Can't you see you're....one of a kind

CHILD, YOU'RE LIKE A STAR
SET APART
SET APART FROM THE START OF THE WORLD
THIS IS YOUR TIME
RISE AND SHINE
CHILD, YOU'RE ONE OF A KIND

Sometimes every thing's too much
Like the deepest cut
You hurt to be touched
When you hear it
If you feel it
Don't let it have its way
I'm writing to say
Something no one can do
Is take the place of you
Oh can't you see you're...one of a kind

[Repeat Chorus]

I know it's hard to hear promises
When the blue has turned to grey
Nobody said it was easy
But I know you'll find your way

[Repeat Chorus]
