
"18, and I'm outta here."
She had reached her independence day.
Never saw her mother's private tears
or the times her daddy prayed
to God to see her through.

[Chorus]
Love comes true...

"21 and I'm so confused,"
getting up her nerve to call collect.
"I do not need help from anyone,
but there's a few little words
I did neglect to say to you..."

[Chorus]
Love comes true...
No turning back the clock,
just waiting for a knock.
Lord, if she only knew.

Love comes with patience.
Love lost is found.
32, married, and kids for her own,
she's come around.
She needs them to help her through.

[Chorus]
Love comes true...
Love is sending out a light.
Love is gonna make it right.
Love is finally getting through.
