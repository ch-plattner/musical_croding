
Island life in the sun
Tryin' to hide from everyone
Livin' a life that pleases you
Big walls that hide you
Where were you those days - Wooooo
When love called, you were away - Wooooo
You know people lost yeh
Bring down those walls yeh

[Chorus]
Its time to make a stand, get up, get up
Its time to take the land
Get up, get up for love

Island life in the sun tryin' to hide from everyone
Livin' a life that pleases you, big walls that hide you
Friends lost with hell to pay - Woooo
Will you let them go that way
People caught by death yeh - Woooo
Do you love the lost yeh - Woooo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The devil comes to rob and to steal
Secret believer, believe me it's real

[Chorus]
