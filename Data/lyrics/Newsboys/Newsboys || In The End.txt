
I'm sick and tired on the world tellin' me
How to live my life
What beer I should drink to make me feel alright
The standards dropping the streets need mopping
The worlds tryin' to change the rules
They've forgotten just how we begun
Humanism taken ist toll

[Chorus]
We'll know who's right in the end
Every knee shall bow
We'll know who's right in the end
Every tongue confess

So be a man and make up your mind
How to live your life
What standard have you set
To make you feel alright
The church is rising, no compromising
Holiness is cool
Men laugh, in the end they'll die
Evolutionists will pay the toll

[Chorus]

I'm sick and tired of the world tellin' me
How to live my life
What beer I should drink to make me feel alright
The standards dropping the streets need mopping
The worlds tryin' to change the rules
They've forgotten just how we begun
Humanism has taken its toll

[Chorus]
