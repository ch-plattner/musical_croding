[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed to let you know
I want this light in me to show.
I'm not ashamed
to speak the name of Jesus Christ.

What are we sneaking around for?
Who are we trying to please?
Shrugging off sin,
apologizing like we're spreading
some kind of disease.
I'm saying, "No way. No way."

[Chorus]

This one warms it's lost cause
- save your testimonies for churchtime.
The other ones state you'd better wait
until you do a little market research.
I'm saying, "No way. No way."

[Chorus]
