
Fisher of men remembers...

And I have watched in wonder
As with a word You calmed a raging sea
I have seen You make the wine from water
Mud and water made a blind man see
Water still reminds me
Of the seaside where our eyes first met

[Chorus]
Let it rain
Lord we're waiting for Your rain to fall
Let it rain
Bringing back the wonder of it all
And I can see Your face again
When You let it rain

And I've been bathed in mercy
By every gesture, every word You've said
Once I spoke of power and high position
You toke a towel and washed my feed instead
Water, like a promise
Heaven opens, but I'm not there yet

[Chorus]

I've been foolish
Thought I know it all
Three times I denied Your name
Your forgiveness, like a waterfall
Washes away my shame

A new dawn is breaking
Another our, and the I leave this place
I am ready, Lord, to give my life up
I'm so ready, Lord, to see Your face
Water, like a promise
And in this final hour, I think my final prayer shall be
Would You let it rain?
Let Your Spirit fall afresh on me

[Chorus]
