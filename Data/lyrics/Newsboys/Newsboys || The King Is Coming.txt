Empty hearts are filling up
Wicked ways are coming undone
Every eye is looking out for You
City lights are burning out
Freedom's song is ringing loud
Dead men waking up to the sound of You
And all our hearts can sing
All our hearts can sing is

Make a way for
Make a way for
Make a way for the King
The King is coming

Split the sky with your glory
Bring to life an awakening
Burn away everything that's not for You
Hear our voices crying out
We won’t stop ‘til heaven's come down
We won’t stop ‘til every knee bows to You
And all our hearts will sing is

[BRIDGE]
Open up the doors
Open up the doors
Lift your eyes to see
Our King is coming
