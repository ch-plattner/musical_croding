Rewind the clock, we were, ridin' a wave 
Of Oz rock, we were, b-barely of age 
To take charge, or pack our guitars for the long flight 
Should we write 
No cash or plan, we were, criss-crossing the states 
In some van, we were c-c-cooking our beans 
On the block while the motor was hot 
Something's got to blow, let's get to the show 

Give us half an inch, 
We'll be tackin'on a mile 
Give us a half stage, 
We'll start up a rampage 

Put on your back pack 
Throw out your road map, 
God'll use anything 
Check it and see 

He's given us more than we ever could ask for 
That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 
That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 

Reset the stage, we were, out rattling the cage 
With each show, we were 
Out hawkin' them shirts 
For more lights 
To shine hit the brights 

And we saw your faces 
And we got new basses 

Good in the lane, we were 
Spinning our drums 
Like a tire 
We were, blowing up the domes 
From a pile, it worked for awhile 
It just didn't rise 
We apologize 

All we got to give is a God-given drive 
It keeps us movin' 
It keeps on groovin' 

Put on your back pack 
Throw out your road map, 
God'll use anything 
Check it and see 

He's given us more than we ever could ask for 
That's the way we roll, cause we've been set free 
That's the way we roll, cause we've been set free 
...... 
Starting up 
We'll lighten up the load at the 
Startin' gate, we'll 
Lighten up the load to a partin' date 
We'll light up the road 
C'mon, kiss your mamma goodbye 
We got to fly 

Put on your back pack 
Throw out your road map 
God'll use anything 
Check it and see 
He's givin' us more than we ever could ask for 
That's the way you roll when you've been set free 
.... 
Put on your back pack 
Throw out your road map 
God'll use anything 
Check it and see 
He's givin' us more than we ever could ask for 
That's the way we roll cause we've been set free 
That's the way we roll cause we've been set free 
That's the way we roll cause we've been set free
