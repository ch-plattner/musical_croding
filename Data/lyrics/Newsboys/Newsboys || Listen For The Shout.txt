
Can you feel His power flowin' through your heart - yeah
Have you ever wondered if you are apart
Signs and times are changin' the world is rearranging
Mankind is actin' playing with the flesh

[Chorus:]
Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again
Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again
Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again
Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again

Raise your eyes and look around
And pick yourself up off the ground
You can make it and you can win
You have the power through Him
Be delighted in the Lord
And He will give you your hearts desire
For when He spoke the world began
It appeared at His command

[Repeat Chorus]

Our sins have gone as far away
As what the east is from the west
The wealth and riches of the land
Would not even fill His hand
So raise your voice and praise His name
Your life will never be the same
I thank the Lord I'm born again
And soon I'll see Him come again

[Repeat Chorus]
