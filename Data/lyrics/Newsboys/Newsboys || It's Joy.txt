I'm filled with joy joy joy
Unspeakable joy
When I talk to Father God
Unspeakable joy
He gives me food along with drink
Unspeakable joy
He has my heart, body and soul
Unspeakable joy

[Chorus]
I'm singing for joy for what I have won
A brand new life beginning in You
I've got to thank Him for what He has done
Praise Him for what He will do

I'm talking about joy joy joy
Unspeakable joy
Hands up in the SPirit
Unspeakable joy
Oh, glory to the Father
Unspeakable joy
To his only Son
Unspekable joy

[Repeat Chorus]
So you want joy joy joy
Unspeakable joy
Then give your heart to Jesus
Unspeakable joy
D-d-d-d-d-dance
Unspeakable joy
Everybody sing, sing, sing
Unspeakable joy

[Chorus]
