It's not a family trait
It's nothing that I ate
And it didn't come from skating with holy rollers
It's an early warning sign
It keeps my life in line
But it's so hard to define
Never mind

[Chorus]
It's just a spirit thing
It's just a holy nudge
It's like a circuit judge in the brain
It's just a spirit thing
It's here to guard my heart
It's just a little hard to explain

It pushes when I quit
It smells a counterfeit
Sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter

When it's teleprompting you
I pray you'll let it through
And I'll help you with the how
But for now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I took the pulpit
Then backed down again
Some things in heaven cannot be explained

I took the soapbox
Then backed down again
Some things in heaven cannot be explained

I took the airwaves
Then backed down again
Some things in heaven cannot be explained

[Chorus]
