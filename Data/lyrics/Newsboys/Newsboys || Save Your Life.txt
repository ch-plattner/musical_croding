Dear Friend,
You've been trying again
Doing whatever it takes to fit in
Falling for the lies of the world
You tell me you'd pay anything just to not hurt
What you want, I ain't got
What I have, can't be bought

There's something better I can give
If you surrender you will live
Just gotta taste and see it's good
I'd make you see it if I could
It's gonna save your life, gonna save your life

Dear Friend,
I'd be lying to you
If I told you this road that we travel would be smooth
Sometimes, you just wanna give up 
Trying, and trying, but nothing is ever enough
Chasing things, but what for? (what for?) 
You've seen it all, but want more

There's something better I can give
If you surrender you will live
Just gotta taste and see it's good
I'd make you see it if I could
It's gonna save your life, gonna save your life

I can see now you want this
And you know that you need this
Get away from the darkness
Get away from the darkness

I can see now you want this
And you know that you need this
Get away from the darkness
Gotta know who Christ is

There's something better I can give
If you surrender you will live
Just gotta taste and see it's good
I'd make you see it if I could
It's gonna save your life, gonna save your life

(Nothing better than this life) It's gonna save your life
(Nothing better than this life) It's gonna save your life
It's gonna, it's gonna save your life
