
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

[Chorus:]
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

My soul, my soul [x2] 

My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[Chorus x2:]
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

My soul, my soul [x2] 

And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

[Chorus:]
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

My soul, my soul [x3]
