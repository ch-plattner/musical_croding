
Savior I come
Quiet my soul
Remember redemption's hill
Where your blood was spilled
For my ransom

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Lead me to the cross,
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord, I lay me down
Rid me of myself, I belong to you
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

You were as I, tempted and trialed
Human
You word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Lead me to the cross,
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord, I lay me down
Rid me of myself, I belong to you
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

To your heart
To your heart
Lead me to your heart
To your heart

Lead me to the cross,
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord, I lay me down
Rid me of myself, I belong to you
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross
