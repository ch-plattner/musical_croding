
Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold to see a revolution somehow

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold to bring a revolution somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
In this world I'll overcome

[2x]
My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

Roaring, He's roaring, roaring like a lion

Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
My faith is dead I need resurrection somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
In this world I'll overcome

[2x]
My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

Roaring, He's roaring, roaring like a lion
He's roaring, He's roaring

[3x]
Let heaven roar
And fire fall
Come shake the ground
With the sound
Of revival

[4x]
My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

He's roaring, He's roaring, He's roaring like a lion [2x]
