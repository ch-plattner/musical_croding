
Poster child for the Christian single
Dumped on more than a birdhouse shingle
Tired of the same old crowd, she starts to
Mingle where she don't belong
All God's bachelors hanging in a bunch
Wolves in a Wool-lite beat 'em to the punch
Score another knockout, barely bought her lunch
What went worng?

[Chorus]
Let's talk about real life
Truth and consequences
And coming to our senses
And lies we'd best unlearn

Let's talk about real love
Truth and propaganda
Are you really gonna stand for
Love that waits it's turn?

I am the voice of the male agenda
Sensitive, strong or shy, I tend to
Act anyway that would possibly send you
Somewhere we can be alone

You're so sure I'm a would be Christian
Suckered by the "Untamed Heart" condition
Love that feminine intuition
Seen that movie, too

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ok, ok, ok - you've got me figured out.
I'm a sham. I never actually studied for the priesthood.
I've had lots of destructive relationships,
And I know I don't deserve someone like
You anyway. It's just, there's this
Strange purity about You... almost a
Radiance. Maybe it comes from your
Religious beliefs, I don't know.
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
You're unlike any woman I've ever met...
Is it getting
Hot in here? Can I help You
With that jacket?

No, no, I know you've got to go...
Oh! No, it's nothing, I've just got this
Really bad kink in my neck... you don't
Suppose you could just massage it a
Little, could you?

[Chorus]
