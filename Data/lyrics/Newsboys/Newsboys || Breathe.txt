Tuesday the third,
I'll call this entry "Mistake"
Cheap imitation
My life feels like a fake
A people person
Some days people annoy me
I'm growing edgy
Wednesday's title: "Avoid Me"

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of God
Breathe on me
'til my heart is new
Breathe on me
Breathe oh Breath of Life
Breathe on me
'til I love like You do

Thursday, the fifth
I title "Drivers Beware"
Tempered-a-mental
And I don't really care
I gave 'til I bled
You laughed when I fainted
Don't want to live this life
Bitter and tainted

[Chorus]
