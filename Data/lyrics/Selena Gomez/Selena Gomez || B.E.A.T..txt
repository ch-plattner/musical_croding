But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

I'm a make you bend your back (back...)
Ey yo, ey yo
Oh my God this beat is crack
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancin' when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face (face)
B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face (face)

I'm a bring the party back (back...)
Ey yo, ey yo
We gon' blow the thermostat
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat, beat, beat (Come on)

Beat, beat, beat, bass (Come on)
Beat, beat, beat, bass

Automatic dancin' addict
I can't get enough...
I can't get enough...
I can't get enough...
But I... beat-beat-beat-beat
Beat in my face

B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face (face)
B-B-B-Beat in my face
B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
