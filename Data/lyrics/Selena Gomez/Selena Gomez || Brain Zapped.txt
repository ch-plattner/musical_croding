
Mom always said that books could take you to another world 
But I don't think that this is what she meant 
(This is what she meant) 
I'm shuttling though 
These distant lands and ocean shores 
Don't really know where I'll go next 
Cuz I've been 
Brain Zapped 
Lets go explore 
Brain Zapped 
To a whole new world 
Brain Zapped 
Come be my guest 
Brain Zapped 
Don't know where I'll go next 
My mind is spinning around 
Got all this knowledge 
Just wanna shout out 
Gotta get it 
Under control 
Cuz the light is green 
And we're ready to go 
Go 
Go 
Brain Zapped 
Lets go explore 
Brain Zapped 
To a whole new world 
Brain Zapped 
Come be my guest 
Brain Zapped 
Don't know where I'll go next
