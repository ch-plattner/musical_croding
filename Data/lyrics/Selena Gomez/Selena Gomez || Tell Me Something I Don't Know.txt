
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
And I shouldn't believe in
The dreams that I'm dreamin'

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[2x]
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me, Tell me something I don't know
Tell me, Tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
The life I'm pursuing
The odds I'll be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
One in a billion, oh
One in a zillion

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[2x]
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

[Rap:]
Selena hit the track
Like Katrina makin' waves
Like Cold Medina, make 'em say
"I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
Really ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)

I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say
It won't be easy

[2x]
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

[3x]
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me
