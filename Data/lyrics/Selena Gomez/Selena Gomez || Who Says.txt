
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey

[Verse 1:]
You made me insecure,
Told me I wasn't good enough.
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself.
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else.

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Verse 2:]
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Bridge:]
Who says you're not star potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect? (yeah)
Who says you're not worth it? (yeah yeah)
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'? (oh)
Trust me, that's the price of beauty (hey yeah, beauty)
Who says you're not pretty? (who said?)
Who says you're not beautiful? (I'm just beautiful me)
Who says?

Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?

Trust me (yeah), that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful? (who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says?
