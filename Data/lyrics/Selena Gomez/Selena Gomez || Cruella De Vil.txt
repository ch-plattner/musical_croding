Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil

The curl of her lips
The ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil...

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil...

Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
...

This vampire bat
This inhumane beast
She 'outta be locked up and never released
This world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
Yeah!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil...

Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
(oooh oh, oooh oh. oooh oh. oooh oh)

At first you think Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You've come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a ROOOOOOOCK!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to  take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh (Cruella De Vil!)
Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh (Cruella De Vil!)
Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
Look out for Cruella De Vil
