
You got my eye
And I'm tryin' to holla at ya
You're walking by
And I trip on the furniture
I'm on my ride down
Won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake,
And I'm spinnin'
It's like a one win race
Yeah, I'm winnin'
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

[CHORUS]
Cause' there ain't nothin' to it
Just gotta do it
You got to own it, own it
Move to the beat of
Your own drum
When it's hot like that (Burn it up like that)
Move to the beat of
Your own drum
When you got it like that (Yeah, it's hot like that)
Eh Eh
Gotta make it say
Eh Ehhh
So
Bang A Drum
Bang A Drum

You got me floatin' ten feet
Off the ground
It's like whoa
I'm up
And I can't come down
My heart's pumpin'
And it's workin' overtime
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doin' it right
When we work together
I'll give up my side
It don't get better
If you want my team
Gotta figure it out
It's you and me
No doubt,

[CHORUS]
There ain't nothin' to it
Just gotta do it
You got to own it, own it
Move to the beat of
Your own drum
When it's hot like that (Burn it up like that)
Move to the beat (You gotta dip it down low)
When you got it like that (Yeah, it's hot like that)
Eh Eh
Gotta make it say
Eh Ehhh
So
Bang A Drum
Bang A Drum
You gotta Bang A Drum
Turn it up
Bang A Drum
Yeah
Bang A Drum
Turn it up
Bang A Drum

You got my eye
And I'm tryin' to holla at ya
You're walking by
And I trip on the furniture
I'm on my ride down
Won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake,
And I'm spinnin'
It's like a one win race
Yeah, I'm winnin'
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

[CHORUS]
There ain't nothing to it (Bang A Drum)
Just gotta do it (Bang A Drum)
You got to own it, own it
Move to the beat (You gotta dip it down low)

Bang A Drum
Bang A Drum (Turn it up)
Bang A Drum
Gotta Bang A Drum (Turn it up)
Bang A Drum
