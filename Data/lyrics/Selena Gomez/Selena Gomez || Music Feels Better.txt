
All I need is love
That's what you give
I'm takin' it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel 
When your skin's on mine

And with you the music's better
Just want us to be together
24/7
And all of the color's brighter
Coz you set me up on fire

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You,  you 

The music feels better with 
You, you

All I need is true
That's what you are
When everything's a lie
All I need is here
Right where you are
You're every reason why

And with you the music's better
Just want us to be together
24/7
And all of the color's brighter
Coz you set me up on fire

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You,  you 

The music feels better with 
You, you

And with you the music's better
And all of the color's brighter
Coz you set me up on fire
Coz you set me up on fire, fire
Coz you set me up on fire

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
So much better with 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou

The music feels better with 
You,  you 

The music feels better with 
You, you 

The music feels better
