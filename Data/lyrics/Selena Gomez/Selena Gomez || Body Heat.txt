
I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat

I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me

I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
Cause baby, that's why I came

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat
