
Disappear
I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that
You'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back
Like a heart attack
That's always breaking
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

I don't wanna be lonely
But you were always the only
One who cast a spell
And made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose ya
So just do your trick
And make it quick
Cause I'm pretending
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

Don't go
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear {disappear}
Don't go, disappear
