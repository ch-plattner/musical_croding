I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
I know you're loco

They say you shouldn’t sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so irresistible
I had to break the rules
Your temper can be sexy
I love it when you hate me

It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
But feels too good, yo

They say you shouldn’t sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you’re so unforgettable
I had to break the rules
Your eyes are like a weapon
They’d kill me if I let ‘em

It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
But feels too good, yo

I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yo
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...

I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you, ooh
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you

It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
It’s out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
Uh oh I know you’re loco
But feels too good, yo

But it feels too good, yeah
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
