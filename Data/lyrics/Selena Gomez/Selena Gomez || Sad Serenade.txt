
Happier times,
Flash through my mind.
We both say it's over and
I believe it this time.
All the pain that I hide,
Let it play through the night.

A sad, sad serenade.
Sad serenade, we almost got it right.
A sad, sad serenade.
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight.

All the love that we made,
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade,
Sad serenade.

I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number,
Are all I have left.

I wish you the best, I really do,
Even though I know that I'm still not over you.
I know that we both are to blame,
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me.

It's a sad, sad serenade.
Sad serenade, we almost got it right.
A sad, sad serenade.
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight.

All the love that we made,
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade,
Sad serenade.

The more you love, the more it hurts,
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over.

In your head, in your heart,
Turn it up, make it stop.
Tonight, all over the world,
The most beautiful song ever heard,

Is a sad, sad serenade,
Sad serenade, we almost got it right.
A sad, sad serenade.
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight.

All the love that we made,
Turn it up, let it play.

A sad, sad serenade,
Sad serenade.
A sad, sad serenade
