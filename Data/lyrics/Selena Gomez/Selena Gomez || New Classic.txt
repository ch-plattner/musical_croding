[Drew]
Ooohh, uh
Oh, Oh
Oh, yeah
Ever tried to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream
Every step that you take forward
Takes you right back where you've been
And then when you least expect it
And you tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinion
Somebody cares what you say
[Both]
You woke me up
No longer tired
[Drew]
With you I feel inspired
You helped me find my fire (uh)
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young,
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that, oh
Tryin' to do it right
No rehearsal, it's your life
When you're doing this crazy dance
Cuz you're makin these crazy plans
[Selena]
It's just a dance, not a test
You put in work to be the best (oh)
It's a classic take on a brand new game
[Both]
Before the needle drops, they're gonna know your name
[Drew]
When it gets old don't lose the love
[Both]
You're cold I'll warm you up (you up)
[Drew]
Your fire's hot enough, enough, enough, enough, enough
[Both]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young, and trying everything
Just to touch your dreams
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more (bring it back once more)
Let me see you do that
[Selena]
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
[Drew]
You're bringin back the real me
No judgement in your eyes
[Both]
Cuz when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
now you made me new
[Drew]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
cuz for paid, young, taking on the world
From the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT Bring the beat back once more

[Both]

Stands for paid, young, taking on the world
From the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more

Let me see you do that, oh
