
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'Cause you're never gonna take me there

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted 
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

One day I want you
And then I don't
I'm gonna leave you
And then I won't.
I can't live live with or without you
I can't live live with or without you

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted 
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you (it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you (my-my-my dilemma)
