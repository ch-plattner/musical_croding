I like who I am 
But I guess you don"t 
I think that I can 
But you think I won't 
Amount to anything at all 

If you love me, 
You sure show it strange 
Is there anything that you would want to change? 
I can't be your paper doll. 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack 
Every chip, 
Every dent 
Every little mistake, 
I wanna be perfect 
Just like you, 
But there's only so much that a girl can do 
When I look in the mirror, 
It makes sense to me, 
Perfectly 
Perfectly 

I like worn out shoes 
You like high heels, and fantasies 
But I'm what's real 
I guess you could say 
The shoe don't fit 
Maybe I'm from Venus 
You're from mars 
My imperfections are what they are 
I guess one of us must deal, with it 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack, 
Every chip, 
Every dent, 
Every little mistake, yeah 
I wanna be perfect, 
Just like you 
But there's only so much, 
That a girl can do 
When I look, 
In the mirror, 
What I see, 
Makes sense to me, yeah 
Perfectly 
Oh, perfectly 

I try to fit 
In the mold 
That you make 
But I'm tired of playing 
This little charade 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack, 
Every chip, 
Every dent, 
Every little mistake, yeah 
I wanna be perfect, 
Just like you 
But there's only so much, 
That a girl can do 
When I look, 
In the mirror, 
What I see 
Makes sense to me, yeah 
Perfectly
