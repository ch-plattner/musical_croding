You won't know anything unless you try
Might endup falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

I won't be whining about
what might've been
You know i'm not too big on giving in
I use whatever spell the law allows
That is of course, if I knew how

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

You won't know anything unless you try
Might endup falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

We're not afraid to fall
Yeah we're going for it all
There's no nothing to our madness
Yeah we're answering the call
If we used a little magic
Well we really can't recall
All i Know is that we're gonna
Make it happen
Ye-oww !
