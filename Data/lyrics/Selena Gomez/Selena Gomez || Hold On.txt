You’re being a jerk now wait
Do you play the riff twice and then I go in
Ok, ready
I’m so embarrassed, I don’t know
Go

Make it to the end
It will better you very soon, oh yeah
Rely on your friends
They’ll get you through
They’re there for you, oh yeah
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away
Don’t let it get you down
It will bury you, very soon, oh yeah
Come into your own
And then let it go
Don’t you know, oh yeah
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

When you’ve had enough of everything
All is left is let it go
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away
