[Selena:]
You come from here,
I come from there. 

[Demi:]
You rock out in your room,
I rock a world premiere.

We're more alike than
Anybody could ever tell
(ever tell)

[Demi:]
Friday, we're cool,
Monday, we're freaks.

[Selena:]
Sometimes we rule,
Sometimes we can't even speak.

[Demi:]
But we kick it off,
Let loose, and LOL
(LOL)

[Selena:]
It may seem cliche
For me to wanna say that your not alone
(that your not alone)

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact i got your back

[Selena:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same 
I think we're almost legendary.
You and me the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
La, La, La, La, La

[Demi:]
I'm kinda like you,
Your kinda like me.

[Selena:]
We write the same song
In a different key

[Both:]
It's got a rhythm, you and me 
Can get along 
(get along)

[Selena:]
And it may seem cliche
For me to wanna say
That your not alone

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I still got your back (yeah)
(I still got you're back) 

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
