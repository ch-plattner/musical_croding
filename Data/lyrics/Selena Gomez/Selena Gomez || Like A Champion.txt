Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum pa pa pum pum

Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum, rum pa pa pum pum

Tonight we come alive
Stand up cause you got that pride
Dancin' and the sweat don't dry
One shot, so baby hit it right
No doubt cause we're young and free
Walk like you run the city
Write your name in the sky
Live it up, cause baby it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself,
You gotta know you're somethin' else,
And show 'em that you never felt so sexy sexy sexy

[x2:]
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum pa pa pum pum
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum, rum pa pa pum pum

We got nothin' to lose, we got nothin' to prove
Shine like diamonds in the sky
Live it up cause baby it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself,
You gotta know you're something else,
And show 'em that you never felt so sexy sexy sexy

[x2:]
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum pa pa pum pum
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum, rum pa pa pum pum

Biddy bum, biddy bum, biddy bay,
Biddy biddy bum, biddy bum, biddy day,
Biddy bum, biddy bum biddy day,
Walk like a champion, Talk like a champion,

Stand up let 'em know that ya shine bright
Throw down let' em know that yagot fight
(Walk like a champion, walk-walk-walk like a champion)

Stand up let 'em know that you shine bright
Throw down let em know that ya got fight
And show 'em that ya never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy

[x2:]
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum pa pa pum pum
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pum pum
Rum, rum pa pa pum pum

Biddy bum, biddy bum, biddy bay,
Biddy biddy bum, biddy bum, biddy day,
Biddy bum, biddy bum biddy day,
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
