
You're so hot (not?)
But if I can be honest
Baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool (not?)
But if you didn't notice
You got me playing a fool
With you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way

You're so... you (ew, gross)
But there's something about you
It's making me feel like I do
With you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will
I'm all about, about
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
