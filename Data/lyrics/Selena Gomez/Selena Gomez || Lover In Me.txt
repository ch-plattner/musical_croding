
In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know

In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm wakin' next to you
I know I'm not the lonely people
That we used to be, used to be
I'm never givin' up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm wakin' next to you
I know I'm not the lonely people
That we used to be, used to be
I'm never givin' up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And it's my favorite part
And it's my favorite part

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
The lover in me is the lover in you
