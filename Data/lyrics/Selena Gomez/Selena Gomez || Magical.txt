
Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone
I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change
See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

I just wanna know what we should have done
Wanna figure out what we could have become
Cause I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just wanna go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

(whoa) Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? (oh) So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true
