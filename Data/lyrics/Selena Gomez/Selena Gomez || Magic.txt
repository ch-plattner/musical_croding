Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love my sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
