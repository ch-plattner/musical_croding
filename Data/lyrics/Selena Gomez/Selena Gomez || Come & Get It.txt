When you're ready come and get it
Na na na na [3x]

When you're ready
When you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na na na na [3x]

You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sittin' right here, real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waitin' standby
Can't stop because I love it, hate the way I love you
All day, all night, maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie.

I'm not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets.
I love you much, too much to hide you, this love ain't finished yet.
This love ain't finished yet…
So baby whenever you're ready…

You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that. (Let me get that yeah)
And baby once I get it, I'm yours no take backs.
Gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever you're mine, baby I'm addicted, no lie, no lie.

I'm not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets.
So baby whenever you're ready…

This love will be the death of me
But I know I'll die happily
I'll know, I'll know, I'll know
Because you love me so… yeah!
