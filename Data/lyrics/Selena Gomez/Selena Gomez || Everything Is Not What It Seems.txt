At the end will no doubt justify the means 
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
(Yes please)

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report, on a book you've never read 
And with the snap of your fingers, you can make your bed! 
(That's what I said)

Everything is not what it seems 
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems 

Everything is not what it seems, 
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things 
Because everything is not....what it seems
