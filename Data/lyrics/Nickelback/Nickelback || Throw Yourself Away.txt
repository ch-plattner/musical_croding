
Baby's born on a bathroom floor
Her mother prays that it'll never cry
But nothing's wrong you've got your prom dress on
When they ask you'll say "it isn't mine"
You know there gonna know you lied

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down

Wash my, hands of this
You notice how god ain't even helping you out
You notice how god ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down

So keep the way you're feeling anonymous
And hide it all until the day you die
Your secrets safe, at least you thought it was
You can only keep it for a little while
And now you're terrified

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down

Wash my, hands of this
You notice how god ain't even helping you out
You notice how god ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down

Baby's born on a bathroom floor
Her mother prays that it'll never cry
But nothing's wrong you've got your prom dress on
When they ask you'll say "it isn't mine"

Damn you for thinking we would never know
And damn you for thinking we would never mind
Only reason that you made it this far
You never asked him, but you never tried

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how god ain't even helping you out
You notice how god ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know there gonna burn it down
