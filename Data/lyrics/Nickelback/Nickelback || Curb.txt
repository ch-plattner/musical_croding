Have I gone all too far?
Have I been here before?
If I have let me know
How it goes
Take her place
And I will
See her face
No reason
Let it slide
And I will
Watch her die...
To run through fields
To find, and I will
Hold, then lead, then lie
And I will... no I won't

Is it now really time?
Can I just give mine,
If I can simply trade
Deal Made

Take her place
And I will
See her face
No reason
Let it slide
And I will
Watch her die...
To run through fields
To find, and I will
Hold, then lead, then lie
And I will... no I won't

Run, hide away from me
Desouled, to seek, decide
And I will, no I won't

Run through fields to find
Hold then lead, then lie
And I will
Run, desouled, and
Hold, to heal, to find
And I can't
