Oh, ohh, ohh, yeah
oh, ohh, ohh, yeah

I was wrong to think
That I could ever trust in you
I was wrong to think that you
Might want to trust me too

Here I am, here I am, here I'll stand
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I'll stand

I was wrong to think
That I could ever love in you
I was wrong to think that you
Might want to love me too

Here I am, here I am, here I'll stand
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I'll stand

So where the hell are you
So where the hell are you
So where are you when I need someone too
And I am hating you

oh, ohh, ohh yeah
oh, ohh, ohh yeah

Here I am, here I am, here I'll stand
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I'll stand

So where the hell are you
So where the hell are you
So where are you when I need someone too
Well I'm tired of hating you

oh, ohh, ohh, yeah
oh, ohh, ohh
