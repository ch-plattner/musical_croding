
As I sift and drift in bullshit
That plagues from day to day
Would you ever really notice
That I've gone away

And I'm over the wall
Over the hill
Over at your place
I'm over the safety
Over the phone calls
Over the rage
What a mistake

When you've lost the stones to throw
These I found to make a fire
And all the lonely souls that say so
Get fired

And I'm over the wall
Over the hill
Over at your place
(Can't seem to get out of the way)
I'm over the safety
Over the phone calls
Over the rage
What a mistake

What a mistake
What a mistake
What a mistake
What a mistake

And I've never been lost
I've never been found
And it makes no difference
If I'm around 
(Can't seem to get out of the way)
It's never been words
It's never been actions
It's never been promises that I've never kept
(Just can't seem to get out of the way)

I'm over the wall
Over the hill
Over at your place
Just can't seem to get out of this
Pulling on the threads
I'm always pulling on the threads
I'm always pulling on the threads
I'm always pulling
What a mistake

Mistake

As I sift and drift in bullshit
That plagues from day to day
Would you ever really notice
I'm gone away
