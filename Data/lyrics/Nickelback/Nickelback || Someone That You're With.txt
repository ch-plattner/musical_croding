
I reside in 209, you're in 208
You moved in last Friday night, 
and I just couldn't wait
So I tried to call across the hall, 
to ask you out someday
But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late

[CHORUS]
Well I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like 
some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place

Because somewhere 
the one I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with 
I wanna be that someone 
that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God I wanna be that 
someone that you're with

Well I hear your favorite songs 
you sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that 
I don't need for conversation sake
Last night I heard your key, 
it hit your lock at 4 AM
Instead of being out with me 
you must be out with them

[CHORUS]

Because somewhere the one 
I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I wanna be that 
someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with

Well somewhere the one 
I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I've got to be that 
someone that
I wanna be that someone that
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
