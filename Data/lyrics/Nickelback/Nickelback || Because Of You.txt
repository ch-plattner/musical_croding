
Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer
Can't make this all go away
Now that you're bleeding you stare at the ceiling
Watch as it all fades away

From what you do, because of you
You know I can't be there
Each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I m here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do, because of you

What you do, what you do
What's become of you?
What you do, what you do
What's become of...?

Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness
Doctor could you be my priest
You say you're mistaken, but look what you've taken
You laugh as you lie through your teeth

From what you do, Because of you
You know I can't be there
Each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I m here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do, because of you

What you do, what you do
What's become of you?
What you do, what you do
What's become of...?

From what you do...

Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer
Can't make this all go away
Now that you're bleeding you stare at the ceiling
And watch as it all fades away

From what you do, Because of you
You know I can't be there
Each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I m here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do, because of you

What you do, what you do
What's become of you?
What you do, what you do
What's become of...?
