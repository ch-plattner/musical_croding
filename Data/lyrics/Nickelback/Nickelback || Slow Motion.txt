
The last straw just broke 
I'm a line in your tasteless joke
What's up with that heart you've stolen?
Don't worry cause 
It's not broken 
It's just swollen

Could anticipate
How you're feeling from day to day
Well about you, now that you're needing
Don't worry cause
They're laughing and you're bleeding

Well I'm drowning
In your ocean
Its much cooler
In slow motion

Don't care where you've went
And not really how much you've spent
Well its obvious that you bore me
I'm not worried cause
Its 5 minutes
Till your glory

Well I'm drowning
In your ocean
Its much cooler
In slow motion

Leave it up to me and i will
Be the one there to see that you stand still
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider
Everyone there believes you're a liar
You're a liar

The last straw just broke
I'm a line in your tasteless joke
Right after you punched a hole in
Don't worry cause
Its not broken
Its just swollen

Anticipate
How you're feeling from day to day
Since it's obvious that you bore me
I'm not worried cause
Its 5 minutes to your glory

Leave it up to me and I will
Be the one to see that your standing still
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider
Everyone here believes your a liar
Your a liar
