A gangster wannabe ya baby that was him
He stole his uncle’s 44 last Friday night
Said if I wanted in we’d have to plan this thing just right
We’ll need the gloves, we’ll need the bags a couple masks
We’ll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
He picked the nearest bank on Main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we’d seen

Screamin’

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (yeah)
We want your cash open the safe get off your phone
Don’t be a hero and you might just make it home

Get ‘em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
[x2]

Get ‘em up
Get ‘em get ‘em up

A freshly stolen Mustang small block 302
Drove past the bank a dozen times this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a block away
Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (yeah)

Get ‘em up

The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was Sunday and the god damn bank was closed
Too bad we didn’t see the cops across the street
We dropped our guns and tried to run and there went all our dreams of

Screamin’

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (yeah)
We wanted easy street and now we’ll never know
Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain’t coming home

Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
[x2]

Get ‘em up
