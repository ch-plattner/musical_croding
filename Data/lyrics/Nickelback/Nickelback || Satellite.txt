
I know it's late but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go until the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

Do you recall how long it must've been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means
Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go until the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance with me round the moon
You and I every night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

I can't believe the days turned into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it 
So we can stay inside this atmosphere

Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance with me round the moon
You and I every night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
