Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end

Well, I've got two tickets to the game
It'd be great if I could take you to it this Sunday
And I'll walk you home when the whole thing's done
If you're there, I don't even care which team won
We can stop at the coffee shop
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot
We can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends

Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, "Don't ever let it end"

Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end

Saturday, I'm gonna take her out
Cause her favorite band is gonna play downtown
Gonna sing the song we've all heard of
About those two young friends that should've fell in love
Later on, we'll cut through the park
And she can hold my hand, cause she hates the dark
And we can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends

Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, "Don't ever let it end"

Don't let it end
Don't let it end (Please promise me that this won't end)
Don't ever let it end

The greatest times we ever had
It's crazy now just looking back, we can laugh
You never know where life's gonna go
Cause we're the only ones who'll ever know
About Sunday night just her and I
Sitting side by side in the full moonlight
I pulled her close, just to hold her tight
And the both of us could tell it just felt right
She looked at me in the sweetest way
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say
Must've took a while just to find the words
Cause she cut me off and finally said it first

Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And you know I feel the same way
Cause I told you drunk on my birthday
And as you pulled me near
You whispered in my ear, "Don't ever let it end"

Don't let it end
Don't let it end (Please promise me that this won't end)
Don't ever let it end

Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
