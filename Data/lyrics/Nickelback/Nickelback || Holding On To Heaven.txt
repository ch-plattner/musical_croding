
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on and hold on

I keep listening to my chest
For a beat but there’s nothing left
It’s been a week since I’ve seen you
And I still can’t believe it
'Cause I’m dying inside alone
And every day we gotta be apart
I’m like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I'll see you
You will know how much I need you
Because I’ll never be letting you go
(Well you know I...)

I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on, hold on

And if I could write a symphony
Then baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that’s blowing away
Like everyone that needs a fairytale
Like every mother’s love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I'm the villain you're willing to save
Now you know why

I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven

And I’m willing to wait
Just to see you another day
What I’m waiting for
Will wash this pain away
And it’s never too late
(Never too late...)

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on and hold on
Now you know why

I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
