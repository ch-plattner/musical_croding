I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave 
Already said goodbye, nothin left to say 
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent 
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this 

Well I'm hating, all of this 
I'm hating, all of this 
All of this, all of this 
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays 
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me 
You came along, and tore this wall down around me 
Looks like you found me 
Now I know why 
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning 

I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change 
If you don't like, there's the door, nobody made you stay 
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it 
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this 

Well I'm hating, all of this 
I'm hating, all of this 
All of this, all of this 
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays 
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me 
You came along, and tore this wall down around me 
Looks like you found me 
Now I know why 
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning 

All of this, All of this 
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays 
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me 
You came along, and tore this wall down around me 
Looks like you found me 
Now I know why 
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
