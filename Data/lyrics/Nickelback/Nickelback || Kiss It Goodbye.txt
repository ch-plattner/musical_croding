
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,

Hollywood is plastic
But easy on the eyes
Big Apple is fantastic
But cuts you down to size

They'll treat you like a doormat
Expecting you to fail
Says right across your forehead
Integrity for sale

You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself

That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
(Kiss it goodbye)

Stealing comes with practice
Lying comes with ease
But neither one is faster
Than falling to your knees

Money leads to fame
And fame is the disease
The latest epidemic
Reality TV

You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself

That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes

They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
And kiss it goodbye

(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)

So let's move to New York
Or out to California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes

They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
