Left on an eastbound train, gone first thing this morning
Why's what's best for you, always the worst thing for me

When am I gonna learn? Why? Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn? Why? Cause I'm tired of waiting

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Well no I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line your selling
Tired of this lie your telling
I won't, I don't, no I won't do this anymore
I won't, I don't, no I won't do this anymore

She says I'm only tellin' half of it
That's probably coz there's only half worth tellin'
And every time I try to laugh it off
That's when you turn around and wind up yellin'

When am I gonna learn? Why? Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn? Why? Cause I'm tired of waiting

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line your selling
Tired of this lie your telling
I won't, I don't no I won't do this anymore
I won't, I don't no I won't do this anymore

She says I'm only tellin' half of it
That's probably coz there's only half worth tellin'
And every time I try to laugh it off
That's when you turn around and wind up yellin'

When am I gonna learn? Why? Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn? Why? Cause I'm tired of waiting

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line your selling
Tired of this lie your telling
I won't, I don't no I won't do this anymore
I won't, I don't no I won't do this anymore
