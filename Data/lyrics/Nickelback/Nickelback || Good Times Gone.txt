
Lost it on the chesterfield 
Or maybe on a gamblin wheel 
Lost it in a diamond mine 
It's dark as hell and hard to find 
You can climb to the top of the highest tree 
You can look around, but you still won't see 
What I'm lookin for 

Where the good times gone? 
Where the good times gone? 
All the stupid fun 
And all that shit we've done 
Where the good times gone? 
Well I still don't know 

Out in the back in the old corn field 
Underneath the tractor wheel 
Thought I'd dig, til I'd found it first 
Broke  my back and died of thirst 
You can bribe the devil, you can pray to God 
You can sell off everything you got 
And you still won't know 

Where the good times gone? 
Where the good times gone? 
All the stupid fun 
And all that shit we've done 
Where the good times gone? 
And you still don't know 

Saw it on the silver screen 
Preacher says, "don't know what it means" 
Last page ad in a comic book 
Bought me a map, showed me where to look 
It ain't carved of stone or made of wood 
And if you paid for it, then it's still no good 
And you still won't know 
What I'm looking for 

Where the good times gone? 
Where the good times gone? 
All the stupid fun 
And all that shit we've done 
Where the good times gone?
