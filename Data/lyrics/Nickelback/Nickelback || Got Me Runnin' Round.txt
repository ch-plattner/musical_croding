My baby still looks amazing with no make-up
Damnit I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers said
I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother
One week
The time it took you to tell me that you love me
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Said it's only 20 karats it can't be that hard to find it, baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round

Light on sunset,
Can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet
Baby, maybe just wait 'cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I looked over
There's no way to sugar coat it
You were busy motorboatin'
On that blonde girl
Keep up with what you're doin'
Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we've got another come along, girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know we'll be flying private
As long as I can be the pilot, baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like, the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like, the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round

[Flo Rida:]
Flo Rida girl, you got me runnin’ round
Yeah, what a perfect misses
My misses still eats McDonald's tastes delicious
Prima Donna not this one so I guess she’ll get it
Work my kisses, work my britches
Every nickel back pays a visit
To my baby yea my baby girl
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain’t goin’ nowhere no underwear
That’s what she wears
Thought a playmate wanna join the party
She responds to me like Hugh Heff?
Birthday Cake wanna grant my wishes
Every day I’m losing my breath
Can’t replace that face that waist
I chase this girl like Belvedere
Baby

She tastes like, the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like, the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said, "Honey, if you want it, you can come with me."
She's got me runnin' round and round
