It's hard to breathe, from underneath
Smothering in all your heat
It's hard to take, It's tough to break
So I don't make the same mistakes
The same mistake, the same mistake, the same mistake, the same mistake
Out in the yard is where I play,
Don't come in cause I'm afraid
You saw my face, I faced my friends
Do I tell or just pretend?
I found a friend, a friend who knows
Who says He'll help but then he goes..
And then he goes, and then he goes, and then he goes, and then he goes...
In front of me, In front of me, So far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, The way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
In front of me, In front of me, So far from me, yeah, yeah, ohh, oh, ohhh...
Fingernails, filled with dirt
If you don't tell you don't get hurt
I cry for help, I pray to God
Another tear he tries to rob
To rob me of, My dignity
Cause sanctuary's far from me
far from me, far from me, far from me, far from me
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
It's hard to take, A piece of me, So peacefully, yeah, yeah
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
So broke inside, Don't run away
And find another place to say
And make our inhibition go away
Because I'm so afraid, yeah, yeah
It's hard to breathe from underneath
Somethering in all your heat
It's hard to take, it's tough to break
So I don't make the same mistakes......
In front of me, In front of me, So far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, The way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
It's hard to take, a piece of me so peacefully, yeah, yeah
In front of me, in front of me, So far from me, yeah, yeah.....
