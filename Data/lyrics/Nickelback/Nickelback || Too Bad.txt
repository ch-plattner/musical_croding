Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a caf√© on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about is
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus:]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk

You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I'm needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus x2]

Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out, we still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus x2]

Long time, let's walk, let's talk
