He's drunk again, it's time to fight 
She must have done something wrong tonight 
The living room becomes a boxing ring 
It's time to run when you see him 
Clenching his hands 
She's just a woman 
Never Again 

I hear her scream, from down the hall 
Amazing she can even talk at all 
She cries to me, Go back to bed 
I'm terrified that she'll wind up 
Dead in his hands, She's just a woman 
Never Again 

Been there before, but not like this 
Seen it before, but not like this 
Never before have I ever 
Seen it this bad 
She's just a woman 
Never Again 

Just tell the nurse, you slipped and fell 
It starts to sting as it starts to swell 
She looks at you, she wants the truth 
It's right out there in the waiting room 
With those hands 
Lookin just as sweet as he can 
Never Again 

Seen it before, but not like this 
Been there before, but not like this 
Never before have I ever 
Seen it this bad 
She's just a woman 
Never Again 

Father's a name you haven't earned yet 
You're just a child with a temper 
Haven't you heard "Don't hit a lady"? 
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure 

He's drunk again, it's time to fight 
Same old shit, just on a different night 
She grabs the gun, she's had enough 
Tonight she'll find out how fucking 
Tough is this man 
Pulls the trigger as fast as she can 
Never Again 

Seen it before, but not like this 
Been there before, but not like this 
Never before have I ever 
Seen it this bad 
She's just a woman 
Never Again
