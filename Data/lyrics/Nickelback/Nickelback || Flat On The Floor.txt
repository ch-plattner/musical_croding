
Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl

In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor

Like I need to defend my own innocence
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the 5th
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl

In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor

8 minutes from losing it a little bit
5 minutes your description might be starting to fit
3 to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl

Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl

In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
I can't stand up at all
Can't see nothing at all
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
