Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stay right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking

If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Once it's started, there's no turning back
But I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
While you're standing in the heart of darkness

If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming (down, down...)

Holding on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home

Holding on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home

Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

If we can find the light
This is the calm before the coming storm
If we can find the light
This is the fight that we've been waiting for

Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on
