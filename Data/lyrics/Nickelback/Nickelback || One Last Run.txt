
Best of friends where'd they all go
Try and find but no one ever knows
This small town makes you wanna stay
Who the hell would want to anyway
Well I'm leaving
And I want it all
Thought I got
Better find this all
And I found out where it's all at

[Chorus:]
And I want it all
Thought I got
Better find this all
And I found out where it's all at

Better now than I'm before
Tried it once now I want it more
Memories all cut in half
Tell the truth then I want you to laugh
We're not laughing

[Chorus]

Burn it all 
Watch and learn
Sell it all watch and learn
Sell it all watch it burn

Steal a car 
We're all headed south 
You know the score so just shut your mouth 
One more run then I want out 
Not like them I'd rather go without 
Without needing 

[Chorus]

Well I knew it all
Forgot it all
Better find this all
And I found out where it's all at
