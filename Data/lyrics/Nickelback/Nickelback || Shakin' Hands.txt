She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes

It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many Five Star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once
Cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold

(Hey, Hey)
Well she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands

(Hey, Hey)
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
Every A-List player is her favorite friend
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She'd done everyone once
And everyone knows
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold

(Hey, Hey)

Far to pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands

Well someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is going easy because he paid for her chest
Yeah he loves little naughty wicked witch of the west

Far to pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
