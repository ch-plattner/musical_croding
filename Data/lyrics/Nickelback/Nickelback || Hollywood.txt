
Please don't be too long while you're gone
There ain't enough to keep me here too long
Not like the last time I stood in line
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls

The  new day, the  new tray that comes around
Pills and all, enough to kill him while he sleeps
Is this the alley we dragged him to
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy

It it worked like she said it would
Just like livin in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency

Please don't be too long while you're gone
There ain't enough to keep me here too long
Not like the last time I stood in line
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls

It it worked like she said it would
Just like livin in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency
