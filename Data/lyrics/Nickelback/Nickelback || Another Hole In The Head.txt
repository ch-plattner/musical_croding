I'm through, thinking of things to say to you
It's true, I've said enough and so have you
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I
Tongue tied, from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you,
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Was I mean to you?
Car keys in your hand
I believe that you would leave me for dead

Your turn, you'd rather leave then live and learn
That's why, you want an end and so do I
This time, I'll leave, and leave it all behind
Tongue tied, from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you,
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Was I mean to you?
Car keys in your hand
I believe that you would leave me for dead

Coz I needed you,
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Was I mean to you?
Car keys in your hand
I believe that you would leave me for dead
I believe that you would leave me for

I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead
I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead

I'm through, thinking of things to say to you
It's true, I've said enough and so have you
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I
Tongue tied, from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you,
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Was I mean to you?
Car keys in your hand
I believe that you would leave me for dead

Coz I needed you,
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Was I mean to you?
Car keys in your hand
I believe that you would leave me for dead

I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead
I believe, you would leave
I believe that you would leave me for
