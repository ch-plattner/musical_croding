
You say you don't want it 
Just watch and you'll flaunt it 
You stare at the ceiling 
And ignore what I'm feeling 

Well that's fine, hey I don't mind 
I can find nothing wrong with it 
And you say in your polite way 
Oh by the way can you get on with it? 

Now that I've seen 
Not really Diggin This! 

Did I ask for your input? 
How's the taste of your own foot? 
To speak and not be right 
You'd like to just rewrite 
My life and take what you like 
And decide with all of it 
And to know that if it goes right 
You'll never find out if I wanted it 

Now that I've seen 
Not really Diggin This! 
Now that I know 
Not really Diggin This! 

Called him twice today 
They said he went away 
I never wondered why 
They tried to hold him 
Ain't never comin' back 
Pull out the welcome mat 
I never wondered why 
They tried to hold him 

The way that its goin' 
To laugh without knowin' 
The way that I'm feelin' 
Inside is unappealin' 

Well that's fine, hey I don't mind 
I can find nothing wrong with it 
And you say in your polite way 
Oh by the way can you get on with it? 

Now that I've seen 
Not really Diggin This! 
Now that I know 
Not really Diggin This! 
Not really Diggin This!
