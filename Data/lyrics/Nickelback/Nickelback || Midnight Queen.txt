
I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies
It's a 50-50 chance that they're planin' to jump me,
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive!

Oh! Well my favorite little waitress has a hold on my eye,
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar,
Her finger's on the trigger, if anybody gets outta line!

There's other places that are better to go,
But I'm addicted to the red light show,
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole,
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!

She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!

Well she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker,
Doesn't want a lollipop but she sure loves a sucker.
They're closin' in around her, I'm cuttin' to the front of the line!

She's got a bottle of Tequila and a lime for her lips
Lay that body on the bar and put that salt on her hips,
I was lyin' when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight!

There's other places that are better to go,
But I'm addicted to the red light show,
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole,
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!

She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
She's gonna be, my, sex machine,
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!

And I can't get enough of the things that she does!

She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
She's gonna be, my, sex machine,
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
