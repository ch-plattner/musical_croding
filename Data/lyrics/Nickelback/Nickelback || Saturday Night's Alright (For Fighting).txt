
It's getting late I haven't seen my date
so tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Want to get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a bar full of wino's
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right
I could use a little muscle to get what I need
I'll drink a fifth of jack and scream out "She's with me!"

A couple of sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
`Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Solo]

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
