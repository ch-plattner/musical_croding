My selfish heart wasn't bein' no good to you
At least not the way it intended to, oh
Your love was young, but it warmed my old soul
When I said, "Goodbye," I wasn't ready no, whoa
But I don't wanna waste your time
No, you deserve to find the love of your life
One day you'll marry such a lovely wife
And hopefully we'll be fine!
Baby, let's keep in touch... oh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'm a miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,
And your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, well forgive my selfish heart

Aye, baby, let's keep in touch
(You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up [3]
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up)

You were the best, but I'm never gonna let you know
Each and every day you'd call me beautiful, hey
You deserve the world and soon the world's gon' come around
And it breaks my heart to have to let you down, yeah

But I don't wanna waste your time
No, you deserve to find the love of your life
One day you'll marry such a lovely wife
And hopefully we'll be fine!

Baby, let's keep in touch... ooh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'm a miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,
And your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, well forgive my selfish heart

Aye, baby, let's keep in touch
(You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up [3x]
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up)

You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up
Sorry I couldn't make it work, I had to call it off
But you were the best in bed, yeah I can't deny
You were a gentleman, yup, one of a kind
But I'm gone 'cause I be swerving
I couldn't give you the time you were deserving
And I admit that I was stupid when I threw our love away
But I hope that we can still be okay

Baby, let's keep in touch... oh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'm a miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,
And your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, well forgive my selfish heart

Aye and, baby, let's keep in touch... oh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'm a miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,
And your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, well forgive my selfish heart

Aye and, baby, let's keep in touch
You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up [3x]
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up
