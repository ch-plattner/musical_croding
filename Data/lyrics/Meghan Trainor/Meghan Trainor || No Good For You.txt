You been acting so sad
Won't you come back? yeah yeah

You never take the town with your girls no more
Always with your new boy
But he ain't all that, but you don't know it yet

Oh his kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you, he's no good for you and I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
And he's no good for you, he's no good for you hey!

That boys no good for ya
You're way too good for him
That boys no good for ya, for ya
Woah, woah, woah no he no good, he no good for you
Woah, woah, woah no he no good, he no good for you

He drives those fancy cars that you like
But he doesn't call you at night and tell you he loves you
And he's thinking of you

No you can't take him home for the holidays
Better keep him away
Cause he's such a tool, girl
And everyone would say I bet...

Oh his kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you, he's no good for you and I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
And he's no good for you, he's no good for you, hey!

That boys no good for ya
You're way too good for him
That boys no good for ya, for ya
Woah, woah, woah no he no good, he no good for you
Woah, woah, woah no he no
Good he no good for you

Won't you take it from a friend
That boy is not a gentleman
And you'll find out soon enough
What you're feeling it ain't love
Cause he called me yesterday
And he asked me on a date
Tried to play you like a fool
And that's why I'm calling you

Oh his kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you, he's no good for you and I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
And he's no good for you, he's no good for you, hey!

Oh his kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you, he's no good for you and I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
And he's no good for you, he's no good for you, hey!

That boys no good for ya
You're way too good for him
That boys no good for ya, for ya
That boys no good for ya
You're way too good for him
That boys no good for ya, for ya, hey!
