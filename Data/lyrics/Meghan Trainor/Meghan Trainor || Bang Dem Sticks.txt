I love it when it's big
You could feel it in the crowd come on, bang dem sticks
I said I love it when it's loud

'Cause you could feel it in the crowd
Come on, bang dem sticks

The dumb drummer,
Sicker than the swine flu
Don't really need medication
He gotta tissue, uh
And when he bang bangs don't need to boogie but,
He might be sweeter than my, my favorite cookie
When he plays, uh, he got a hold on me
In a race yeah he's got that winnin streak, uh
And ain't nobody got a drummer like mine
He can bang dem sticks he can throw dem high, ha!

I got a thing for drummers
How the beat shakes up my heart

So, baby, show off all dem tricks and bang dem sticks

You could feel it in the crowd
Come on, bang dem sticks
I said I love it when it's loud

I don't think they're ready, it's OK

Triplet triplet, all dat shit
He looking so good when he bang dem sticks
He could do the paradiddle
With a little bit of samba
And all the girls scream "I want yo drummer's numba!"
But wait a minute? What the fuck is going on?
You here to see MTrain
Because you love my songs
But there he go again with the double stroke
And I ain't talking dirty I ain't makin no jokes nu uh nu uh
And he could play all night whatever get you hype girls whatever gets you high.
