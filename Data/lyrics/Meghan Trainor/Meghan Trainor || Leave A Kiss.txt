Say our farewells tonight
'Cause we can't miss out of life, and
Leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.
Take all my love with you,
and say you love me too, please.
Leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.

So long my friend, until I ever see you again,
I'm asking you to leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.

Oh, you used to be my world, and I was your only girl, so
I'll leave a kiss, so you won't feel alone tonight.

So long my friend, until I ever see you again,
I'm asking you to leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.

Maybe you're the wrong guy, maybe it's the wrong time, maybe I should wait.
Maybe you're the right one, baby but I'm so done begging you to stay.
Oh, I don't wanna fall or ever lose it all, what am I to say.
To this questions, I'll never get an answer anyway.

So say your farewells tonight, 'cause we can't miss out on life, and
Leave a kiss so I won't feel alone tonight

So long my friend, until I ever see you again,
I'm asking you to leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.
So long my friend, until I ever see you again,
I'm asking you to leave a kiss, so I won't feel alone tonight.
