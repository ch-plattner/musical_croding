'Cause I saw him with his new baby
And he treats her like she's the one

It's not that I want him back
Ain't trying to be mean
But I bought him brand new clothes
And burned his skinny jeans,
And she'll never know
That I made him better for her

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool,
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
You know who
Give credit where it's due... Hey!
Oooh-wee

He holds her hand at the movies,
Never stares at other boobies
I bet she thinks he's the one...

She should be thanking me and sending me some flowers
I taught him everything, now he can last for hours (Yeah)
She'll never know
That I've made him better for her

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool,
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
You know who
Give credit where it's due... Hey!

Yo... he used to be whack
But I made him all that
Well shit, if you think of my last name
I guess my trainings where it's at
Had him brushing his teeth, even flossing...
Got him looking like Ryan Gosling
I guess that makes me pretty awesome
But I wasn't in love so I tossed him...

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag, I made him cool,
He used to be a fool

So, give some credit where it's due,
Give props to you know who
You know who
Give credit where it's due... Hey!

Give me that credit... baby baby
Give me that credit... baby baby
Give me that credit... baby.
'Cause you know who...
Give credit where it's due
You'll never know
You'll never know, he wasn't like this before...
You'll never know
You'll never know, unless you're hearing this song
