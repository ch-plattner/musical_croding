Everybody's on the same page
No new chapters
We'll never change

Everybody wants to be cool, yes they do...
And I'm just like them
But I won't be no fool

I guess I could waste all my time and my money, just trying to look right
But it doesn't change who I am in my heart if I look like a dime

So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
No, I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes

(Sh-sh-show them what's beautiful sh-sh-show them what's beautiful)
Come and show them... Uh... Hey...
(Sh-sh-show them what's beautiful
Sh-sh-show them what's beautiful)

Everybody's born to be different
That's the one thing that makes us the same
So don't you let their words try to change you
Don't let them make you, into something you ain't... No!

So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
No, I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes

(Sh-sh-show them what's beautiful)

Show the world the you inside
Raise your voice and close your eyes
'Cause you're beautiful...
Come on and show the world the you inside
Raise your voice and close your eyes
'Cause you're beautiful...

So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
No, I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes
