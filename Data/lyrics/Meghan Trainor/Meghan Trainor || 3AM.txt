
I can't believe I'm still doing this
I told myself a month ago that I'd be through with this I'm looking at my phone
And wondering if you're home
I'm kinda tipsy, I ain't tryna sleep alone
Somebody told me that some other girl was hugging
You, Baby you know I'm the one that should be loving you
You know we had a thing
Baby, it's such a shame
I still get crazy every time I hear your name
And I know it's complicated
But you know I'm impatient

3AM, yep I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
And I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3AM, I might be looking for a late night friend and baby
I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

Kinda stressing like I'm gonna have a heart attack it's
Been an hour and you haven't even hit me back baby
Keep it real,
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause I miss you, you don't know how this feels

I know it's complicated
This always happens when I'm wasted

3AM, yep I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
And I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3AM, I might be looking for a late night friend and baby
I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

I know, I know, I know
It's so wrong
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I been drinking all night long
All night long
All night long
I know, I know, I know
It's so wrong
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I been drinking all night long
All night long
All night long

3AM, yep I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
And I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3AM, I might be looking for a late night friend and baby,
I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
