Tryna force puzzle piece,
Not a perfect fit for me
But they told me give it time.
Maybe Cupid missed my chest
'Cause I keep looking left
And you ain't mister right

You're so sweet when we're kissing
But there's something I'm missing
Baby, there's no chemistry.
Yeah, we look good on paper
You can call me a hater,
But let's talk honestly!

Hey, no, you ain't the perfect match for me
Aye aye aye aye
But you were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope it didn't come off as a tease
Aye aye aye aye
You were so close my Mr. Almost

All my girls say lock him down,
Guys like him don't come around
Go and pick your wedding rings
Hmm
Yeah, my mom thinks you're legit
But I'm way too young for this
So I'm gonna tell you what I think
Yeah

You were so sweet when we're kissing
But there's something I'm missing
Baby, there's no chemistry.
Yeah, we look good on paper
You can call me a hater,
But let's talk honestly!

Hey, no, you ain't the perfect match for me
Aye aye aye aye
You were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope I didn't come off as a tease
Aye aye aye aye
You were so close my Mr. Almost

I know that this could be alarming
But you can't go and call me boo
I'm looking for my Prince Charming
So close my Mr. Almost

No, you ain't the perfect match for me
Aye aye aye aye, oh, darling
You were so close my Mr. Almost

Mister almost a billionaire
Mister almost yours 'til you almost caught feelings there (Where?)
Right there at the blue bird
When we were singing them songs we wrote
This is what you said and I quote
"I love ya, baby, baby, so much, you da one.
Ain't nobody better than you up under the sun."
That's the part where I run
That's the part where I dip
But I stilllllll love them hips (Yaaaaooow)

Hey no, you ain't the perfect match for me
Aye aye aye aye
You were so close my Mr. Almost
I hope I didn't come off as a tease
Aye aye aye aye
You were so close my Mr. Almost

I know that this could be alarming
But you can't go and call me boo
I'm looking for my Prince Charming
So close my Mr. Almost

No, you ain't the perfect match for me
Hey hey hey, oh darling
You were so close my Mr. Almost

[Shy Carter:]
Mister almost a billionaire
