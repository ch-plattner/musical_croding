Yeah, walls can't always fall, but when you call me baby doll.
It feels so right as you hold me in your arms tonight.

Love me, that's the way it should be.
Lay there right beside me, even in the light of day.
Honey, sweeter than my sundae.
Make my worries go away, I just need to hear you say.

You'll be just fine.
Oh baby doll, won't you ease your mind.

Cause walls can't always fall.
But when you call me baby doll, it feels so right as you hold me in your arms tonight.

Save me, take me to a good place.
Set a smile on my face.
Pray it never fades away.
In time, I'll find all the right rhymes, to sing you, for the clear signs.
I just need to hear you say,

You'll be just fine.
Oh baby doll, won't you ease your mind.
Cause walls can't always fall, when you call me baby doll.
It feels so right as you hold me in your arms tonight.

Hmmmmmm, ohhhhhhhh, hey ey iii yeah, mmmmmmmm, yeaahh.
Cause you'll be just fine, oh yes you will, won't you ease your mind.

Cause walls can't always fall, when you call me baby doll, it feels so right as you hold me in your arms tonight.
