Good day, good morning
Goodbye goodbye
to Mr. Lonely
I feel I feel, a little less stressed

No more no more
dumb boys to deal with
I'm on my own
feel like a new chick
I'm finally over this mess

I don't need no one to depend on
I can find my own inspiration
I can do whatever I want to, whenever I want to

Never ever ever will I need someone
Never ever do I rely on one
Cause I'm all grown, I'm all grown
And I'm okay on my own, okay on my own
Never ever ever will I need someone
Never ever do I rely on one
Cause I'm all grown, I'm all grown
And I'm okay on my own, okay on my own

I don't need you

I'm good, I'm good
with or without you
You won't see tears
won't need a tissue
Cause I'll be fine, and this is my time

I'm looking in every direction
Just hoping for Mr. Perfection
But I won't wait in line (no, no)

And I don't need no one to depend on
I can find my own inspiration
I can do whatever I want to, whenever I want to yeah

Never ever ever will I need someone
Never ever do I rely on one
Cause I'm all grown, I'm all grown
And I'm okay on my own, okay on my own
(So) Never ever ever will I need someone
(No) Never ever do I rely on one
Cause I'm all grown, I'm all grown
And I'm okay on my own, okay on my own

Well you can try, to say that I am co-dependent
But I depend on me, yes me and only me

[1st Layer:]
You can try, to say that I am co-dependent, am co-dependent
But I depend on me, but I depend on me
I said me and only me, me and only me
