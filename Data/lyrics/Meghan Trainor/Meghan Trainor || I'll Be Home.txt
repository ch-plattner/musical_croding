He said "Winter love is spreading everywhere"
Summer came and took off with the spring
So now we start the Christmas Caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you
And one for me 
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Pack your bags and tell them You'll be there"

I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
Home, I'll be home

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Wrap the gifts with all your love and care"
The wind blows the snow up in the sky 
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise
I'll be home, I'll be home

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Pack your bags and tell him you'll be there"

I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home

I'll be home with my love this Christmas 
I promise, I promise
I'll be home
