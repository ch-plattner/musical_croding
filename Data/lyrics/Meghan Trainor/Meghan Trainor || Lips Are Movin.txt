If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced?
Nah... I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl
I'm a hold it up
You full of something but it ain't love
And what we got is straight overdue
Go find somebody new

You can buy me diamond earrings
And deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye
Bye-bye-bye

I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are movin
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young
But I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are movin
Baby, don't ya know I'm done

If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe

Hey, baby, don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late, babe, oh
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced, babe, oh

You can buy me diamond earrings
And deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye
Bye-bye-bye

I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are moving
Baby, don't ya know I'm done

Come on, say!

If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe
If your lips are moving (Alright now)
If your lips are moving (I wanna hear ya'll singing with me)
If your lips are moving
Then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', babe (Here we go!)

I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin
'Cause your lips are moving
Baby, don't you know I'm done
