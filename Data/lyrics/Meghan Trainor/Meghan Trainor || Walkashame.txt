Oh my God,
I put my pants on inside out
I couldn't tell 'cause the lights were out
I beat the sunrise again, oh oh oh
Neighbors stare,
I smile and wave 'cause I just don't care
They're probably jealous of my sexy hair
And the heels in my hand

Well, please don't judge,
It was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Well, don't act like you haven't been there
Seven AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame
Well, my daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame

Oh, my brain,
Little birdies sound like airplanes
How could something so cute cause me so much pain?

Well, please don't judge,
It was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Well, don't act like you haven't been there
Seven AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame
Well, my daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame

I might be walking, but it's only 'cause I'm out of breath
Don't even try to act like you ain't done the same yourself
If you're gonna do the walk, do it like a boss... a boss (that's right)

A little bit of rum in my tummy
Yum yum
I shook it up, and danced like a dummy
Dumb dumb
He kissed me and he called me his bae
Asked me to stay
How could I turn that away?

Don't judge,
It was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe

Don't act like you haven't been there
Seven AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame
Well... My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame

Don't act like you haven't been there
Seven AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame

I said a walk, walk, walk
Do the walk, the walk, walk, walk
Do the walk, the walk, walk, walk
It's the walk of shame
