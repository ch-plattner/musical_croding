Walking on my waist like I'ma break it downaholic
You love watchu saw, you say, "girl you know you got it"
Now you change your mind, you say I'm way too naughty

That's what you wanted, you, you even told me
Said you want a hottie, with a little love for danger
Now you don't want me, you, you say I'm crazy
But I'm different baby

So what you expect, I'm not like the rest
Nothing you say can change me now
Said I was the one, but it's over and done
Such a mistake to turn me down
Boy be careful what you wish for (Aye)
You be careful what you wish for (Aye)
You be careful what you wish for (Aye)
Cause that's just what you get
I was the one, but it's over and done
Such a mistake to turn me down

Yeah my name's M-Train, yup, th-that's what they call me
I push them boys aside cause way too many want me
You know what it is, I got you all up on it
Now you change your mind, you say I'm way too naughty

That's what you wanted, you, you even told me
Said you want a hottie, with a little love for danger
Now you don't want me, you, you say I'm crazy
But I'm different baby

So what you expect, I'm not like the rest
Nothing you say can change me now
Said I was the one, but it's over and done
Such a mistake to turn me down
