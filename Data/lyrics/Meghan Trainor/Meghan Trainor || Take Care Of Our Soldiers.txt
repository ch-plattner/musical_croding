
Here's to all the soldiers
We are here and they are there
Fighting for our freedom
So let's make sure they know that we care
We can lift our voices
Say a prayer
As long as they know that we're here

Let's take care
Take care of our soldiers
Hold them tight
Keep their spirits high
Take care of our soldiers
Wipe their eyes
Don't let them cry, cry tonight

Here's to all the soldiers
We hope and pray that they're okay
Here's to all the mothers and fathers riskin' their lives each and everyday
We can lift our voices
Say a prayer
As long as they know that we're here

We'll take care
Take care of our soldiers
Hold them tight
Keep their spirits high
Take care of our soldiers
Wipe their eyes
Don't let them cry, cry tonight

People dyin'
Family's cryin', cryin' too
So hold on
Hold on and be strong
We'll pray that they come home soon

Take care of our soldiers
Hold them tight
Keep their spirits high
Take care of our soldiers
Wipe their eyes
Don't let them cry, cry, cry

Take care of our soldiers
Hold them tight
Keep their spirits high
Take care of our soldiers
Wipe their eyes
Don't let them cry, cry, cry tonight

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, Don't let them cry tonight
