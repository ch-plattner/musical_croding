Well maybe it's your mind
Telling you all of the lies 
Trying to show you what's right
Ohhhhhhhhh
Well maybe you're alright 
Maybe you fell out of love
But I'm not giving up

And I wonder where you are now 

Don't let go 
I'm still here 
Waiting for your broken words
Trying to put them together again 
Please take time
To realize
Nothing matters any more 
We should fix our puzzle again 
Mmmmmmmm

I'm forced to hide my pain
I'm forced to hide my cries
Can't handle anymore lies
And I'm lost in the showers crying for hours
Cuz no one can tell I'm gone
And I, I've never felt so wrong 

And I wonder where you are now 

Don't let go 
I'm still here 
Waiting for your broken words
Trying to put them together again 
Please take time
To realize
Nothing matters any more 
We should fix our puzzle again 
Mmmmmmmm

Don't let me go I'm still here
Nothing matters anymore 
Let's fix the broken puzzle again
