
Luther left at first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky wave good-bye
They're gonna have to share the wait together
Idle hands will see a good fire slowly die.

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly

The old black rooster sang in death down that dirt road
His steps in bold, his man of fancy free
I pray we see him alive and well in the forehead
In that Godforsaken place in Tennessee

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, men stand united
When flags and bullets start to fly

After all this, if we should prevail
Heaven help the South
When Sherman comes their way
