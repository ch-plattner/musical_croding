
Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head
Starving for affection, waiting to be fed

Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive

Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again

I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite

Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines

I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman

Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of
