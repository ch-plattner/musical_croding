
Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth

Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie on a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie for that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something that sounds like the truth

Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name

Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect

I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you.
