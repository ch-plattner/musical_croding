
You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance, I held my breath
Love always ends up hanging by a thread

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold

You said don't cry to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part

Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep
