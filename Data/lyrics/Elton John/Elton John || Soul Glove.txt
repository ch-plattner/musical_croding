
You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through

And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove

Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet

But I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands
