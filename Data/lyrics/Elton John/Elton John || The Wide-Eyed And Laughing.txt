Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King

For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tealeaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed

Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing daughters of some different age
