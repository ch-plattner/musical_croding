Your hot coffee & my black tea
I don't know about that
Oh guess we choose to disagree
But I like your pork pie hat
Well your sister always came between us
Claiming she was best
But she hitched a ride to a diplomat
& she moved to Bucharest
While we just sat around an round
Like a dolpha in a bed

[Chorus]
I can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell
Oh can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell

Battle ins field & new york streets
Were watching from a bridge
But what the theif an you said made no sense
To even stole them anyway
Oh a living cheap in an old hotel
Eating rice & beans
Stayin up late takin a bottle each
With a couple of Times Square queens
We just turned the heat up
On the stories we could tell

[Chorus]
I can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell
Oh I can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell

[Instrumental]

Now I'm sunbathing in the sun
Was always on my mind
But you tanned from the inside out
Drinking coco butter wine
While you sold your past life
Baptist fire was miaking plans to leave
But you trapped me that ball his bell?
On another new years eve
So I give it up for what it's worth
Crawling to your shell

[Chorus]
I can't say I ever liked you
But you're my kind of hell
Oh I can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell
