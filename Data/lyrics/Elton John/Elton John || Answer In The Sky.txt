Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light

And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep

You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
