
I feel I'm feeling light
And I'm up to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?

Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
Your chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone dropped right in to say hello
Hello!

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
I'm better off to someone else like me

Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone dropped right in to say hello
Hello!

[Bridge:]
??

Hello hello
Hello hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone dropped right in to say hello
[x2]

Hello Hello
Hello Hello
