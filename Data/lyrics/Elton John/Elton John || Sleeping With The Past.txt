Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
He's stolen your tears one by one
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime

And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
