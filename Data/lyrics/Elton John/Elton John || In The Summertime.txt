
In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a draft
Go out and see what you can find

If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a __
When the sun goes down, you can make it, make it good and then they buy

We're not __ people, we're not dirty __
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy, __ yeah that's our philosophy

Sing along with us, de de de-de-dee
Da da da-da-da, yeah we're hap-happy
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da

When the winter's here, yeah it's party time
Bring you bottle, __ it'll soon be summertime
And we'll sing again, __ settle down
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into town
