There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinking ships behind

Come on __
We're going up around the bend

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon __ wood

You can ponder perpetual motion
__ your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me
