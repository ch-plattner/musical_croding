
Whenever I hear good-bye
Reminds me, baby, of you
I break down and cry
The next time I'll be true, yeah

Fever for lost romance
Reminds me, baby, of you
I took a crazy chance
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me, baby, of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah

Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels
Like I felt it with you

When I'm dancing round
Reminds me, baby, of you
I won't let you down
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true
