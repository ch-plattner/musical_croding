
I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game

If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
'Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again

My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
My heart's in the right place on page seventeen

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill

Heart's in the right place
I'm gonna destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
'Cause I'm an old bitch you see and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree

Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree
