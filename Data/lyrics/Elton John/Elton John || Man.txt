
Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

He's the hoax behind the thrill
The poison arrow, the bitter pill
Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
He's the light behind the hill
The broken promise, the iron will
Hard to kill, hard to understand
