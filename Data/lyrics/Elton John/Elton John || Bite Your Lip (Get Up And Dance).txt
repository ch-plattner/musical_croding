She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Strobe light on the funky feet
Soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Chicago, L.A.
Every place, every way
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Strobe light on the funky feet
The soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Illinois, Santa Fe
Do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
