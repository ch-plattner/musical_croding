Are you standing outside?
Looking up at the sky
Cursing a wondering star
Well If I were you
I'd throw rocks at the moon
I'd say damn you wherever you are
I don't know where to start
This cage 'round my heart
Locked up what I'd meant to say
Or I felt all along the way
Just wondering how come
I couldn't take your breath away

Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
When I should've sent roses
When you crossed my mind
No other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should've sent roses

Looking back on my life
Oh, if fate should decide
I could do it all over again
I'd build no more walls
I'd stay true and recall
The fragrance of you on the wind
You'll get better than me
Someone who can see
Right from the start
Given all that you need
I'll slip away
Knowing I'm half the man I could be

Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
And I should have sent roses
When you crossed my mind
For no other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should've sent roses
Yeah should've sent roses
