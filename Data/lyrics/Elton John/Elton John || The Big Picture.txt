
On and on
The story of our lives goes on and on
The path of time
The sunsets up ahead roll along

In your eyes
The option of a warm embrace implies
You're my friend
Happy endings keep our love alive

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

Wanna be your main man in the big picture
What a deal
To get a part like this

Day to day
The shifting wind just blows us on our way
Here and there
Our pockets full of things to say

Oh my love
I proudly represent you in this world
Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

Hope I got a future in the big picture
At the last embrace
From the first kiss

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star
