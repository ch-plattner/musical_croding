I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight

How could I know that you had used me
Fill out some plan of your own
I could have known you'd abused me
Leave me here hurt and alone

If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know that you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I only sung what I wanted to sing
You were a dream in my mind
I never know how you never could be
It didn't take long for me to find

I guess that it's mine for foresee
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you would be
A player just acting for me

If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight

If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know you could be just like it should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
