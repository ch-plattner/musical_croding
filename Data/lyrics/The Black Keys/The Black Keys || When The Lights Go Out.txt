
Don't it hurt so bad,
Standin' in the sun,
The bottom of your heart,
You don't love no one,

You can be,
Oh, so mean,
I just can't see,
No in-between,
You know what the sun's all about,
When the lights go out,

What a way to live,
Back of your class,
The end of the line--
You're always last,

You can be,
Oh, so mean,
I just can't see,
No in-between,
You know what the sun's all about,
When the lights go out,

See the moon,
See the stars,
From your lonely seat,
In lonely cars,

You can be,
Oh, so mean,
I just can't see,
No in-between,
You know what the sun's all about,
When the lights go out,
Lights go out,
Lights go out,
Lights go out,
Alright.
