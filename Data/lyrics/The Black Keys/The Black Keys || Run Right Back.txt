
Before she hits the ground
She's gonna want to explode
Never step aside
Never run and hide

She holds it all up under
That pretty head of hers, oh
It comes screaming out
In an electric shout

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to

I run right back
Run right back to her
I wanna jump the track
And run right back, I'm sure
I run right back to her

I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her

Well she's a special thing
She doesn't read too much, oh
But there's no doubt
She's written about

Finest exterior
She's so superior, oh
But she won't allow
And I'm wounded now

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to

I run right back
Run right back to her
I wanna jump the track
And run right back, I'm sure
I run right back to her

I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her

Oh yeah...
