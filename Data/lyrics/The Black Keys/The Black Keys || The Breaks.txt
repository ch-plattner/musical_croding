The speaker and listen with a sparkle
In your eye as though you might be thinking
'gee this is the most wonderful thing
I've ever heard in all my life'" 

Back in the day, we were eye to eye
The thought of you had me runnin' wild
They say love lost will never grow
But hey, hey, hey I still love you so 

Oh when we met you know the sun did shine
From your eyes back into mine
Oh if the sun is shinin' no more,
Hey, hey, I still love you so 

I'll beg the moon and the stars above,
Bring me back my, that gal I love
I know you're gone, you're gone for sure,
But hey, hey, hey, I still love you so
