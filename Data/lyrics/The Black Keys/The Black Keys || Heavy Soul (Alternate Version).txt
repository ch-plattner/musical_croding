
Hear her callin',
"Come to me,"
Thoughts of her,
Won't let me be,
Go to the valley,
Climb the hill,
Whatever it takes, darlin',
You know I will,
Hey now, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',

I hear her callin',
"Hurry home,"
Been so long,
Since I've been gone,
Won't get tired,
Won't go astray,
I hear her callin',
Call my name,
Hey now, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',

Just my color,
Just my kind,
Your heavy soul,
Next to mine,
Heart's on fire,
Get no sleep,
Drive all night,
No relief,
Hey now, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin',
Your heavy soul, darlin'.
