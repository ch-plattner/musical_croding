
He found all hands against his own,
He found all eyes were lookin' down,
And the sun had left and gone,
All his friends could not be found,

Don't talk about, don't think about love,
She's not the one you're dreamin' of,
Don't talk about it, can't live without it,
You say you're alone,
He found all hands against his own,

He found the sky had turned to gray,
And the clouds start rollin' in,
Got no use for what they say,
Got no use for where they've been,

Don't talk about, don't think about love,
She's not the one you're dreamin' of,
Don't talk about it, can't live without it,
You say you're alone,
He found all hands against his own,
You say you're alone,
He found all hands against his own,
You say you're alone,
He found all hands against his own, alright,
You say you're alone,
He found all hands against his own, alright,

He found all hands against his own,
And no light from up above,
Just a dark and lonely road,
He found all hands against his own.
