
Follow you down,
Hold your hand,
Make you realize,
I'm the only man,
Who got the will,
And the way,
To be the one to give my heart away, yeah,

Yeah...right...oh,

Late at night,
When you lay,
In the bed,
That I made,
Who will heed,
Your dismay,
And be the one to give their heart away?

Oh...yeah...right,

I'm long gone,
In outer space,
With no one here,
Gonna take my place,
So bye-bye, baby,
I've gone away,
And no one there will give their heart away, yeah,
Oh...right...oh,
Right...no.
