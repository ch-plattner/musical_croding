
Keep me clean,
Keep me warm,
Keep my soul away from harm,
Keep the night,
Keep the day,
Keep the in-between away,

Hold that second,
Hold the time,
Hold that picture in your mind,
Hold the smoke,
Hold the fire,
Hold all that now you desire, hey!

Show me trust,
Show me love,
Show me heaven up above,
Show your soul,
Show your mind,
Show it to me all the time, hey!
Hey!
Hey!
