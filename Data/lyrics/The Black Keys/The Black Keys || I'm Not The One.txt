
I've been tried 
And I've been tested 
I was born tired 
And I never got rested 
Harder than Marble stone 
I'm better off Better off left alone

Cause I'm not the one 
No I'm not the one 
You wanted it all 
But I'll give you none 
Cause, I'm not the one

Well, like a toy 
To a kid 
I said jump 
And mama you did 
You know, your daddy knows 
And your mama knows 
That's wrong 
So now it's time 
For me to move on

Cause I'm not the one 
No I'm not the one 
You wanted it all 
But I'll give you none 
Cause, I'm not the one

You think 
That I'm normal 
But all these years
I'm just trying to warn you 
You'd do good 
To move on 
No it won't 
Hurt me none

Cause I'm not the one 
No I'm not the one 
You wanted it all 
But I'll give you none 
Cause, I'm not the one
