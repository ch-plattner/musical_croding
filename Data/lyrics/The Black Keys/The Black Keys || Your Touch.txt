And I want
And you got it
So much
I'm crazy for
Your touch

Your touch
Your touch
Your touch

And I'll be good
Like I should
Waitin' is such
Misery, I need
Your touch

Your touch
Your touch
Your touch

Hey

A little louder now
I've got to shout it now
Please rush
I need
Your touch

Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
