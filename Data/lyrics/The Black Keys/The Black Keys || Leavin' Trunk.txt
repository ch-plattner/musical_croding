
Goin' upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk
I ain't seen no whiskey
Woman make me sloppy
Ain't seen no whisky
Woman made me drunk
Goin' back home
Where I had much better luck
Look here darling
Want me to be your king
Said you're kiddin' darling
Gotta keep it hid
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here
