
How you hurt me, oh how you cause me pain
Well hurt like mine you could never never understand
Never understand
I remember the tears were in my eyes
River town is burning, the clouds they roll on by, roll on by
She said I'm alright if you're hangin' on
Be your shoulder, lay your troubles on, your troubles on.
