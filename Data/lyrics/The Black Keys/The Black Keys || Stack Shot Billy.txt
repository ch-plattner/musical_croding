
Stack shot Billy in the back of the head,
Stack made sure Billy Lyons was dead,
.45 pistol down in Stack's right hand,
Send him away to the promised land,

Stack shot Billy,
.45,
Stack shot Billy,
Billy lay down and died,

Stack Lee had himself an evil brain,
Loved his gun and his sweet cocaine,
Stack got quiet when the shadows fell,
Knew soon enough that he'd burn in hell,

Stack shot Billy,
.45,
Stack shot Billy,
Billy lay down and died,

Stack shot Billy in the back of the head,
Stack made sure Billy Lyons was dead,
.45 pistol down in Stack's right hand,
Send him away to the promised land,

Stack shot Billy,
.45,
Stack shot Billy,
Billy lay down and died.
