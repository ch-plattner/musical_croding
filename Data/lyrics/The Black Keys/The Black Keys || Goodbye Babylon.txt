Well I came to see,
And what I found was not alright with me,
Desperation, suffocation,
And it'd been the same thing all along,

Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon,

Now I know times are changin',
And the people need rearrangin',
So now it's written here in song,

Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye,

Now our boys...they're fallin',
Our leaders are all appalling,
And you can bet by God, 
Good will is gone,

Goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon,
Oh, goodbye Babylon,
Goodbye Babylon, hey.
