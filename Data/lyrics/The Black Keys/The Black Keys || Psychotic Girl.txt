I heard you threw your man around
Pick him up just to let him down
It's a shame, baby, but I always knew
Just the way you're gonna do, oh

Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world

Friday night in the party lights
You were acting like everything was alright
Till later on with no one around
Had me fighting for air, laying on the ground, oh no

Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world

I thought you'd changed, but I should've known
You'd play nice for a time and then you do me wrong
I thought long and hard 'bout what I should I say
And when I was through it just came out this way, oh no

Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world
