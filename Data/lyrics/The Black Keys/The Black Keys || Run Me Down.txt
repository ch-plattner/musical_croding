
Run me down in the winter,
Run me down spring,
Got to the place
Can't do a goddamn thing
But after a while,
You ain't gonna run me down anymore

Run me down in the city,
Run me down on the farm,
Run me with your eyes
And your heavy charm
But after a while,
You ain't gonna run me down anymore

I do for you, lord do for me,
You run me down, where you want me to be
But after a while,
You ain't gonna run me down anymore
