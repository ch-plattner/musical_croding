
Yeah,
No fun, my baby, no fun
No fun, my baby, no fun
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hand around
Freaked-out, for another day

No fun, my baby, no fun
No fun, my baby, baby, no fun
No fun to be alone
Walkin' by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

Maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call my mom on the telephone, come on

No fun, no fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone
To be alone
No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
