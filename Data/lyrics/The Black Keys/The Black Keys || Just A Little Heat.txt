Just a little heat,
Now on this cold day,
You know it would take my,
Worry away, worry away, ahh,

It's in my head,
I can't let go,
No matter what you said,
'Cause I...already know,
Leavin' this place,
'Cause you, you've got it written,
All over your face,

Oh...oh,

Why can't trouble,
Find a new friend?
'Cause this can't be the way,
The story end,
Oh, no,

It's in my head now,
And I can't let go,
No matter what you said,
'Cause I...already know,
Leavin' this place,
'Cause you, you've got it written,
All over your face,

Oh...oh,
Oh...oh...oh.
