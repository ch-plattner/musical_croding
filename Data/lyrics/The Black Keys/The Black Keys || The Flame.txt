
Out of all the things,
You've ever done,
This time I can't go back,
When a heart gets broke,
This many times,
It's easy to lose track,

Takin' all this pain,
And you know I can't regain,
The flame,
Oh, the flame,

Like a dream to me,
Time with you,
So unreal,
Maybe another life,
Love for me,
Is what you feel,

Takin' all this pain,
And you know I can't regain,
The flame, oh,

Greater men made it here,
Only to turn back,
So cut me loose, if you want,
Or tighten up the slack,

Takin' all this pain,
And you know we can't regain,
The flame,
Oh, the flame,
Yeah...oh.
