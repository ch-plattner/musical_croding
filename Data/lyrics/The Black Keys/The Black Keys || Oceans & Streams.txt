With guilt that no man should carry
Heavy enough for me to get buried
I feel death on the road tonight
It's got me to where I wanna run and hide

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?

These days I'm so slow
All those thoughts and nowhere to go
My aim it used to be so true
My world had a place in it darlin', just for you

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?

'Scuse me, now, I gotta go
Can't stand to be here anymore, no
I'm sick and I gotta go to bed
If I stay now, I'm better off dead

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?
