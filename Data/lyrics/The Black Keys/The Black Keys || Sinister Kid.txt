Well, the crooks are out 
And the streets are gray 
You know I wouldn't have it 
Any other way

Your mother's words 
They're ringing still 
But your mother don't 
Pay our bills

A sinister kid is a kid who 
Runs to meet his Maker 
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born 
Straight into his Maker's arms 
And that's me, that's me 
The boy with the broken halo 
That's me, that's me 
The devil won't let me be

I got a tortured mind 
And my blade is sharp 
A bad combination 
In the dark

If I kill a man 
In the first degree 
Baby would you 
Flee with me?

A sinister kid is a kid who 
Runs to meet his Maker 
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born 
Straight into his Maker's arms 
And that's me, that's me 
The boy with the broken halo 
That's me, that's me 
The devil won't let me be
