
Where'd you get those fancy clothes?
Where'd you get those, goodness knows,
Just show some civility,
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me,

I don't need no luxuries,
'Long as you are understandin',
I'm not difficult to please,
Act nice and gentle to me,

I am the kinda guy who,
Likes to take you as I found you,
Throw away your false eyelashes,
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me,

Holdin' my hand,
Understand,
Act nice, ooh,
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me,

Holdin' my hand,
Now understand,
Gentle to me,
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me, ooh.
