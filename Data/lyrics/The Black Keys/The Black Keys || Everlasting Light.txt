
Let me be your everlasting light
The sun when there is none
I'm a shepherd for you
And I'll guide you through
Let me be your everlasting light

Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
I'll hold and never scold
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
In me you can confide
When no one's by your side
Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Oh baby, can't you see
It's shinin' just for you
Loneliness is over
Dark days are through
They're through
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
A train goin' 'way from pain
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
Love is the coal
That makes this train roll
Let me be your everlasting light
Yeah

Let me be your everlasting light
Let me be your everlasting light
Let me be your everlasting light
Ohh...
