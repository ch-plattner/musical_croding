Hear her calling come to me
Thought of her wont let me be
Go to the valley, climb the hill
Whatever it takes darling, you know I will

Hey now darling
Heavy soul darling
Hear her callin' hurry home
Been so long since I been gone
I wont get tired wont go astray
I hear her callin' call my name

Hey now darling
Heavy soul darling
Just my color, just my kind
Got a heavy soul next to mine
Heart's on fire
Get no sleep
Drive all night
No relief
Yeah now darling
Heavy soul darling [x4]
