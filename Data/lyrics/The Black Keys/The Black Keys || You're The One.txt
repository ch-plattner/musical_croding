
When I was thirteen,
My mom said "Son,
You're the one I adore,"
Now I'm old and wise,
When I see your eyes,
You're the one I adore,

Oh~oh~ooh~oh,
Oh~oh~ooh~oh,
Oh~oh, oh-oh,
Oh~oh~ooh~oh,

Will you be true,
Till life is done?
Be the one I adore, oh,
You're the one I adore,

Oh~ooh~oh~ooh~oh,
Oh~ooh~oh~ooh~oh.
