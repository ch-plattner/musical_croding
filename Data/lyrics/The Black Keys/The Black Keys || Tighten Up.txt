I wanted love, I needed love,
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall
For you
Oh, what can I do?
Yeah

Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reigns
You're runnin' wild, runnin' wild
It's true

Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how,oh show me how
To get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

When I was young and moving fast
Nothing slowed me down,
Oh slowed me down
Now I let the others pass
I've come around,
Oh come around
'Cause I've found

Living just to keep going
Going just to be sane
All the while not knowing
It's such a shame

I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
I'm telling you to be ready
My dear
