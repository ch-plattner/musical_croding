
I need you, need you by my side
Lonely evenings, eyes are open wide
Nothing you say could make me turn my back
Well I see you, and you see me too
Moon is rising, night will be here soon
Follow me, and lay down in my room
Hold me, hold me in your arms
Well now heal me, heal me with your touch
Your touch keeps me hangin' on
