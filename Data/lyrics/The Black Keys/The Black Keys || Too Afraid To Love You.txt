My gears they grind 
More each day 
And I feel like 
They're gonna grind away

And the city blocks
They drive me wild 
They're never ending 
Mile after mile

I just don't know what to do 
I'm too afraid to love you

It's heaven on earth 
In her embrace 
Her gentle touch 
And her smiling face

I'm just one wishing 
That I was a pair 
With someone 
Oh somewhere

I just don't know what to do 
I'm too afraid to love you

All those sleepless nights 
And all those wasted days 
I wish loneliness would leave me 
But I think it's here to stay 
What more can I do 
I'm wringing myself dry 
And I can't afford to lose 
One more teardrop from my eye
