
Though I never met you 
And we spoke not a word 
I'll never forget you 
Through stories that I've heard 
For you unknown brother 
My baby's mother is pained 
Cause your soul is in heaven 
But your memory remains

Unknown, unknown brother 
I'll meet you someday 
Unknown, unknown brother 
We'll walk through fields where children play

Your eyes shined bright 
When you were a kid 
Your sisters loved you 
And all that you did 
Big brother, big brother 
Don't worry a bit 
Your flame has not faded 
Since the day it was lit

Your life 
Was joy 
Your mama's 
Only boy 
And when the skies 
Are blue 
Big brother 
They're blue for you

We'll smile like pictures 
Of you as a boy 
Long before you retired 
To heavenly joy

Unknown, unknown brother 
I'll meet you someday 
Unknown, unknown brother 
We'll walk through fields where children play
