Alright,
See her walkin',
With a fella,
Two of them
So nice and mella,
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey,
My heart is broken,
It's open wide,
Feel so down,
Deep inside,
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, alright,
Hit it,

Summer's here but I'm still in fall,
Wonderin' what she done me for,
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, alright,
I'm too far down the deepest ditch,
Too far gone to ever switch,
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey, hit it,

Alright...yeah...alright...yeah...yeah, alright,
Hit it...alright...alright,

Drive all night now,
Without a care,
Hope to catch you,
Standin' there,
Hey-hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey,
Don't forsake a desperate man,
Hope you know that's who I am,
Hey hey, hey-hey hey-hey-hey,
Alright, yeah...hit it...alright...yeah,
Ahh...ahh,
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight.
