
Gone like the wind
And the state it put him in
To hold his head high
When he really wan' die

And you know the difference it makes
And you know all that it takes
Is love, so he won't break
He won't break

He's crazy from the pain
And can't get hurt again
And if he ever falls
I'd feel sorry for us all

And you know the difference it makes
And you know all that it takes
Is love, so he won't break
He won't break
Won't break, he won't break

Right around the way
Is where they go to pay
For remedies and pills
To ease their ills

And you know the difference it makes
And you know all that it takes
Is love, so he won't break
He won't break
Won't break
He won't break
