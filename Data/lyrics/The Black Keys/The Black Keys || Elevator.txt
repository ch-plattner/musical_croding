In the elevator,
I pick my floor,
And if I wanna battle,
I pick my war,

Hold tight,
Hold on,
Hold tight,
I was blind for a time,
Now I find,
The choice is mine,

And I get seasick,
On dry land,
And I hear voices,
Sayin' "Do what you can,"

Hold tight,
Hold on,
Oh,
I was blind for a time,
Now I find,
That the choice is mine,

Hold tight,
Hold on,
Oh,
I was blind for a time,
Now I find,
That the choice is mine,
The choice is mine,
Oh~oh~oh, oh,
The choice is mine,
Oh~oh oh...yeah.
