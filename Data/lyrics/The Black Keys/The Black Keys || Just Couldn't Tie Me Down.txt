Will you let me know,
How you've changed?
I can't tell,
In any way,

Little village, is not a town,
Just couldn't tie me down,

You sent a message,
To my mind,
Without reason,
Without rhyme,

Happiness, come around,
Just couldn't tie me down, yeah,

Feel the wind,
Hit your skin,
I see the shape,
You put me in,

Saw your talkin',
Heard the sounds,
Oh, just couldn't tie me down, yeah.
