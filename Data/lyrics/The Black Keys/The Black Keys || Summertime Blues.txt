I'm-a gonna raise a fuss,
I'm-a gonna raise a holler,
'Bout a-workin' all summer just-a tryin'a earn a dollar,

Told my congressman and he said "Well,
I'd like to help ya son,
But you're too young to vote,"
Sometimes I wonder,
What I'm-a gonna do,
For there ain't no cure for the summertime blues,
One two three four,

I'm-a gonna raise a fuss,
I'm-a gonna raise a holler,
'Bout a-workin' all summer just-a tryin'a earn a dollar,

Now I told my congressman and he said "Well,
I'd like to help ya son,
But (something)"
Sometimes I wonder,
What I'm-a gonna do,
(something).
