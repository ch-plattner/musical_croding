
You hold on
To love that's gone
Run a mile
To see him smile
But you don't know
He's door to door
Playin' you
For the fool

Let him go
Walk out your door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

Now you know
There you go
Back to him
He's gonna do you in
Tear you down
And run you 'round
Treat you wrong
And then you're gone

Let him go
Walk out your door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

You hold on
To love that's gone
Run a mile
To see him smile
But you don't know
He's door to door
Playin' you
For the fool

Let him go
Walk out your door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
