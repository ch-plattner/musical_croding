
You walk around in other towns
I've seen you out, just hangin' 'round
It's what you chose and I suppose
You'll need me one day, need me one day

You throw away  every other dream
 Taking nova baby to the dollar machine
 That party dress is such a mess 
You'll need me one day, need me one day soon!

All your enemies
Smile when you fall
 You take it cause you
 Don't know what you want
You don't know what you want.

All this love of mine
 All my precious time 
You waste it cause you 
Don't know what you want 
You don't know what you want

There go the kids, the have-nots
 Elevator ladies in the parking lots
 You saw it all  and I recall
The dream you told me, dream you told me.

This empty heart , you left me with
The ribbon on my parting gift
 I'm falling hard  for every yard 
Of the dream you sold me, dream you sold me, oh!

All your enemies 
Smile when your fall 
You take it cause you 
Don't know what you want 
You don't know what you want

All this love of mine 
All my precious time 
You waste it cause you
Don't know what you want
You don't know what you want
