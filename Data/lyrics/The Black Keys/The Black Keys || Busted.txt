
Well I'm busted, yes I'm busted
But my heart won't let me die.
If you feel alright darlin'
Won't you come around
Won't you come around
'Round, 'Round, 'Round, 'Round 

If you love me like I love you
Please won't you let me know
I'll play it all night darlin'
Walk through my door
Walk through my door
Walk through my door

Door, Door, Door, Door ...
