
Kings and sons of God
Travel on their way from here
Calming restless mobs
Easing all of their, all of their fear

Strange times are here
Strange times are here

Statue in the square
Meant so much when it first stood
People come from far and near
To bless them if, bless them if it would

Strange times are here
Strange times are here

Sadie, dry your tears
I will be the one
To pull you through the mere
Before you come, before you come undone

Strange times are here
Strange times are here
Strange times are here
Strange times are here
