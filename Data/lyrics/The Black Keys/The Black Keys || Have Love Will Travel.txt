
If you need lovin', oh baby I travel

I travel from Maine down to Mexico
To find that girl that loves me so
No matter where I be I find that girl and she satisfy me

Have love, will travel
Have love, will travel
If you need lovin, oh baby I travel
If you need lovin, oh baby I travel

I might take a boat, I might take a plane
I might hitch-hike or jump a railroad-train
Your kind of love drive a man insane
So look for me walkin' just any old way

Have love, will travel
Have love, will travel
If you need lovin, oh baby I travel
If you need lovin, oh baby I travel
