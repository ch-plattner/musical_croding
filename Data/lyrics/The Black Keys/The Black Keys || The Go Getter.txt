The Go Getter
I'll be the Go Getter
Yes I am
I'll be the Go Getter
That's my plan
The Go Getter

Hi-fi boom box 
Pretty girl in bobby socks 
Afterparty in a hotel room 
Pretty soon there will be no moon 
Stumble home in the pouring rain 
Let the water ease my worried brain 
Some days I just can't get alone 
I need a head to lean my shoulders on

Palm trees 
The flat broke disease 
And L.A. has got me 
On my knees 
I am 
The bluest of blues 
Every day 
A different 
Different way to lose 
The Go Getter
The Go Getter
The Go Getter

I got a table at the Rainbow Room 
I told my wife I'd be home soon 
Big ships are approaching the docks 
I got my hi-fi boom box 
Mashed potatoes in cellophane 
I see my life going down the drain 
Hold me baby and don't let go 
Pretty girls help to soften the blow

Palm trees 
The flat broke disease 
And LA has got me 
On my knees 
I am 
The bluest of blues 
Every day 
A different way to lose 

The Go Getter
The Go Getter
The Go Getter
I'll be the Go Getter
That's my plan
That's who I am
The Go Getter
Yeah the Go Getter
