
Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
It'll do me no wrong

Somebody callin' out my
Somebody callin' out my
Somebody callin' out my
Keep on callin'
Keep on callin'
Call on me
Call on me

Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
Oh boy, I'm alone with the moan
Keep on callin'
Keep on callin'
Keep on callin'
