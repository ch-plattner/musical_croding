
Wake up
You're gonna wake up to nothing
Break up
The break up is coming
When you’re heart is hollow
Another pill to swallow

Shake up
Gotta shake up you’re freezin’
Make up
I’m gonna make up my reasons

I used to say I need you
But now I gotta leave you

Sister, sister what did they do to you
Sister, sister what did they do to you
Did they take and try to break
A heart that long
It’s so wrong

Hung up
Got me hung up in draft
Rung up
Got me rung up in bed

You took advantage of
The one who showed you love

Sister, sister what did they do to you
Sister, sister what did they do to you
Did they take and try to break
A heart that long
It’s so wrong
It's so long
So long
