
Well, he ran around 
Late at night 
Holding hands 
And making light 
Of everything 
That came before 
But there she was 
Behind the door

She hit them with her ten cent pistol 
Because they ruined her name 
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol 
And they've never been the same

There's nothing worse 
In this world 
Than payback from a 
Jealous girl 
The laws of man 
Don't apply 
When blood gets in 
A woman's eye

Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol 
Because they ruined her name 
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol 
And they've never been the same

Stars did fall 
Thunder rolled 
Bugs crawled back 
In their holes 
The couple screamed 
But far too late 
Cause a jealous heart 
Did retaliate

She hit them with her ten cent pistol 
Because they ruined her name 
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol 
And they've never been the same
