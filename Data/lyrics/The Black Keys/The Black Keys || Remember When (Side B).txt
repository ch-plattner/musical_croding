
All right
Happened when I heard her name
The same old thoughts crept back again
Oh, they grew...yeah, they grew

Somewhere in my sorry state
The lightning struck that old iron gate
Oh, it's true...yeah, it's true

With snow in tow, the winter winds
Smacks you on your cheeks again
Oh, it stings, oh, it stings

Remember how I held ya near
And whispered in your precious ear
Sweet things...yeah, sweet things
Hey

It happened when I heard her name
Same old thoughts crept back again
Oh, they grew...yeah, they grew
Ahh
