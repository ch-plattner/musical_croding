Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh,

I don't wanna go to hell,
But if I do,
It'll be 'cause of you,
And a young man's,
Gonna make mistakes,
Till he hits the brakes,

My heart's on fire,
With a strange desire,

Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh,
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh,

All those birds,
On the wire,
Are gonna say I'm a liar,
But we all know,
In the end,
They never were my friend,

My heart's on fire,
With a strange desire.
