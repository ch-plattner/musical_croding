
Yeah!

I was a movin' man in my younger days
But I've grown out of my ramblin' ways
I left that road so far behind
Now I know, oh baby

I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine

So baby when I rolled, I rolled deep
So much so, I didn't get much sleep
Rock and roll hustle all the time
Now I know, oh baby

I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine

Whoa, I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine
Hey~ey
