
I got up this mornin',
Put on my shoes,
Tied my shoes,
Went to the mirror,
For to comb my hair,
I made a move,
Know what to do,
Try to break and run,

Baby, this ain't me,
Baby, this ain't me,
Grown so ugly,
Grown so ugly,
Don't even know myself,
Don't even know myself,

Left Angola, 1964,
Walkin' down the street,
Knock upon my baby's door,
My baby come out,
And ask me who I am,
I say "Honey,
Honey, don't you know your man?"
She said "My man been gone,
Since 1942,
And I tell you, Mr. Ugly,
He didn't look like you!"
