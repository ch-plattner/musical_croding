
My hand to God 
I didn't mean to 
After all 
Look what we've been through 
Men come in different shades 
That's how we're made

The little house on Ellis Drive 
Is where I felt most alive 
The oak tree covered that old Ford 
I miss it Lord, I miss it Lord

These blood red eyes 
Don't see so good 
But what's worse is if they could 
Would I change my ways? 
Wasted times and broken dreams 
Violent colors so obscene 
It's all I see these days 
These days

Watch what you say 
The devil is listenin' 
He's got ears that you 
Wouldn't believe 
And brother once you go to him 
It's your soul you can never retrieve

These blood red eyes 
Don't see so good 
But what's worse is if they could 
Would I change my ways? 
Wasted times and broken dreams 
Violent colors so obscene 
It's all I see these days 
These days
