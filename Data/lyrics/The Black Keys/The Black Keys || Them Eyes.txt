
Hey, cant you see my cryin'
Hey, don't you see me dyin'
When I look into them eyes

I know that I did you wrong
But baby, you lasted so long

If you dont bring me back this time
I swear im gonna lose my mind

Hey, cant you see my runnin'
Hey, don't you know im commin'
When I think about them eyes
