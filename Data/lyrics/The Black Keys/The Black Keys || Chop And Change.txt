
An innocent child in New Orleans 
A simple girl from simple means 
Walked the rails 
Rode her thumb 
She hitched a ride with everyone 

The regular, she'd rearrange 
The girl knew how to chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change 

Took a job workin' late 
Jackin cars from out of state 
She found no love in this town 
So she'd never mess around 
Had no luck, but ain't it strange 
The girl knew how to chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change 
Chop and change
