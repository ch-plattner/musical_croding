You're wound up like a weapon
You've got an evil streak
They told me to stay away
But I was much too weak

Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl

I hounded/hunted you forever
But you never saw
This love was so strong it shoulda
Been against the law

Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl

You tear me all apart
Then act so warm
Like being cooled by the rain
In the eye of the storm

Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl
