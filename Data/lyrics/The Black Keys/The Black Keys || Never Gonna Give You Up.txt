Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Girl, you treat me bad 
And I know why
I've seen you runnin' around 
With another guy
And you think if you hurt me 
That I'll go away
But, I've made up my mind that 
I'm here to stay

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Do you see these tears 
In my eyes?
Ain't no use in me lyin'
Cause I really cried
You think you're gonna take me
And put me on the shelf
I'd rather die 
Than see you with somebody else

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

My friends all say 
That I'm your fool 
And you're using me like 
A carpenter uses a tool 
I know their intentions 
Are all very good 
Some of them would help me 
If they could 

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'
