But there is one voice that has never been heard before,
The voice of old Mr. World himself,
The way he might sound if he could speak to us in our own language.

Mr. World, how was this wonderful orderly Earth of ours formed in the first place,
And how long has it been going on?
I am the Earth, the planet you call home.
Scientists believe I am at least four and a half billion years old.
