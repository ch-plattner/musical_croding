She said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes makin' me feel like I've never been born

I said, who put all though things in your head
Things that make me feel like I'm there
And your makin' me feel like I never was born

She said, you dont understand what I said
I said no no no your wrong, when I was a boy....
Everything was right
Everything was right

I said, even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause your makin' me feel like I never was born
She said, she said, she
Said, she said, she said
