
Midnight In Her Eyes
Midnight is in her eyes
Tear drops like a child
You never thought about goin' wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes
Lately you're feeling low
Heartache on the floor
Your manic ways have got the best of you
But your heart is gonna see you through
Lately, you're feeling low
I see her everywhere
Long amber hair
Calling out my name
I'm calling just the same
Midnight is in her eyes
Tear drops like a child
You never thought about goin' wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes
