
Can't explain
Nor can I contain
Control
You have on my soul

It's all I do is
Baby dream of you
I'm falling down
When you're around

You're the only one
You're the only one
I'm so wrapped up in a daze
Hoping this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one
You're the only one
Cupid's bow it stung
Now you're the only one

Mystery
Is what this is to me
I'm giving up
I'm having no luck

Like a ghost
The one that I love most
She disappears
When I get near
