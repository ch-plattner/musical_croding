
If you need lovin',
Oh baby, I'll travel,

I'll travel from Maine down to Mexico,
To find that girl who loves me so,
No matter where I be,
I find that girl and she'll satisfy me,

Have love, will travel,
Have love, will travel,
If you need lovin',
Oh baby, I'll travel,
Yeah,

If you need lovin',
Oh baby, I'll travel,

I might take a boat,
I'll take a plane,
I might hitch-hike or jump a railroad-train,
Your kind of love drive a man insane,
So look for me walkin' just any old way,

Have love, will travel,
Have love, will travel,
If you need lovin',
Oh baby, I'll travel, yeah,
If you need lovin',
Oh baby, I'll travel.
