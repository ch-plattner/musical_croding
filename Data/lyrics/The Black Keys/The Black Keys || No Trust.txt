She wanna get outta the car in the middle of the road
And her screaming and hollerin' is getting mighty old
She check every paper when you step out the room
Ain't go no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
She want a simple life
She need a simple man
That don't drink or smoke darlin'
Play in a rock & roll band
Oh, but she want you to hold her at night when shes lonely and blue
Ain't go no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
Yeah she's a beautiful gal when she wanna be
But if you told her so darlin', she'd just disagree
Oh, she hates your job and what you want him to do
Ain't go no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
