
Love me,
Don't leave me,
Make me feel you need me,
You kill me,
Thrill me,
Don't you know that I will be,
Callin' on you everyday,
Till I get my way?

Darlin', I wonder,
How you pulled me under,
You kill me,
Thrill me,
Don't you know that I will be,
Callin' on you everyday,
Till I get my way?
Till I get my way, hey!

Darlin', remember,
The cold, cold nights in December,
Kill me,
Thrill me,
Don't you know that I will be,
Callin' on you everyday,
Till I get my way?
Till I get my way,
Till I get my way,
Till I get my way, hey!
