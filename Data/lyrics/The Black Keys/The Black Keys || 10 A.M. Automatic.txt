
What about the night,
Makes you change, yeah,
Oh, from sweet,
To deranged?
What about my voice,
Tells you who,
Who's been wrong to you?

Yeah,
You've got pains,
Like an addict,
I'm leavin' you,
You've got pains,
Like an addict,
10 A.M. automatic,
Alright, yeah...hey,

I see darkness cover us, alright,
And your car,
Kicks up dust,
What about my way,
Makes you doubt,
All these words from my mouth?

Here we go,
Yeah,
You've got pains,
Like an addict,
I'm leavin' you,
You've got pains,
Like an addict,
10 A.M. automatic,
Yeah, alright...hey,
Hey!
