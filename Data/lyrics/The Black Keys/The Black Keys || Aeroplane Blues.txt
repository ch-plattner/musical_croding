I'm on an airplane,
'Cross the sea,
Goin' nowhere,
I wanna be,

Distant land,
Don't know who I am,

Eyes are heavy,
Mind is shook,
Can't feel,
Drugs I took,

Distant land,
Don't know who I am,

Take your seat,
Don't be shy,
You've got to remember, yeah,
That you were born to die,

Distant land,
Don't know who I am,
Don't know who I am,
Don't know who I am.
