Even though
You don't know
You're reacting all along
What I see
Is killing me
You won't make it on your own

In this hell of a season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, yeah

Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
Know I do, oh

Even though
I don't know
I'm pretending that I do
It's my curse
I can reverse
I'm still waiting here for you

In this hell of a season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, oh

Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
You know I do, oh

In this hell of season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, yeah

Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
You know I do, oh

In this hell of season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, oh

Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
You know I do, oh
