
Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can’t take much more
I could never drown in

They wanna get my…
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It’s alright
Ain’t no guard in my house

Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can’t go without
I could never drown in

They wanna get my…
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It’s alright
Ain’t no guard in my house
