
When I need to replace her
I am the mind eraser
Anything goes, yeah, anything goes

Got this sin in her brain
But she ain't gonna see me again
See me again, this I know
But oh, deep down I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
Oh, don't let it be over, let it be over, over

Seen me stack up my woes
Into a wall, around a rose
Now I'm the rose, now she knows
Oh, it hurts so, and I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over, oh
Oh, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh oh

Oh, don't let it be over, over
Oh, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh.
