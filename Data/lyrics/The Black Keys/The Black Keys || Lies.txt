
You said the moon was ours
Yeah, you said the moon was ours
To hell with the day
The sunlight is only gonna take love away
Raise up suspicions and...and alibis
But I can see through tear-blinded eyes

Lies, lies, lies
Oh, lies
Da da da da da
Oh~oh~oh

I got a stone where my heart should be
I got a stone where my heart should be
And nothin' I do will make you love me
I'll leave this town break all my ties
There'd be no more use for any disguise

Lies, lies, lies
Oh, lies
Da da ahh~ahh~ahh
Oh~oh~oh

I wanna die without pain, yeah
I wanna die, oh, without pain
All this deception I just can't maintain
The sun, moon, stars in the sky
It'd hurt me too bad if you said goodbye

Lies, lies, lies
Oh~ooh-ooh, lies
Da da da da da
Oh~oh~oh
