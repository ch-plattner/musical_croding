She was made to blow you away 
She don't care what any man say 
You can watch her strut 
But keep your mouth shut 
Or it's ruination day

She's long, long gone 
She's long gone like 
Moses through the corn

Her eyes are rubies and pearls 
And she's not made like those other girls 
Her lashes flap and they smack men back 
Like springs they bounce off of her curls

She's long, long gone 
She's long gone like 
Moses through the corn
