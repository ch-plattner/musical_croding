
Whoa Whoa
Do do do do do
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
Yo,
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n
Never seen before

I said Yo,
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it
There she is I got to stop her

Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time
She's out the door
I got to go for mine

I think I'll say

[Chorus:]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo
I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

[Verse 2:]
Now shorty grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance

Don't worry about it
We'll just 1,2 step
1,2 step

Now if the music is moving too fast (too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer

Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say

[Chorus (2x)]

[Breakdown:]
I want to be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing

Baby it's so romantic

Baby I can be in your heart

So many things I want to tell you
I think that I should start by saying

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she get it
There she is- I got to stop her

I know your trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

[Spoken:]
Now everbody just clap your hands like this(like this)
Just clap your hands like this (woo like this)

And if your shorty in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand homie
Make her understand you all was made to dance like this (like this)

You all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this)
Just let her know she was made for you.
And you want to do everything she want to man.

[Laughs]

Woo!
