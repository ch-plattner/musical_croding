
Yeah, is how I feel, right?
It's only me right? ha
It's like, ha

I was 15 a virginia nigga with ambition
Young but I invisioned fuckin them bad bitches
Live my life with no regret
I try to show respect but you don't give it I guess you don't understand when
It might take me a life time to take it back
And it might take you a life time to know the facts yeah
Just 'cause different don't mean we distant
And if you kill a man ain't no way to bring it back
Yeah they say its mind over matter
But what we're livin for what really matters
Some niggas just silver spoons on the platter
And other niggas is doomed just for disaster
All alone sleeping in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets mama is gonna be dead soon
'cause a man beat her, but he don't realize
She important to this family like a fucking heirloom
Yeah a nigga still found his way out
a Record deal came a nigga played out
My mama livin good, she takin days out
They sayin boy all that hard work payed off
Five hundred racks for an hour show
But ain't gon neva do a 60 minutes interview..
'cause all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kind of tipsy of that red rum murda
I'm singing ass nigga know you heard of
Me, every day my click stuntin
Niggas talking down but I'ma make em pick them words up
I done said all I had to say what else
Cock suckers low blowin under my belt
Yeah they hangin from the tip
They tryna get a sip don't let em get a grip..
I'm pissing on em myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
3 years and nigga just found a better me
Yeah you might find another lover,
But you always started with breezy like the letter b
Nightmares feelin haunting
Thinking do I really like this star shit huh
Because fame ain't freedom and this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers telling me to wear they clothes and they wanna be my sponsor
But when a nigga fall off again they gonna be like "off 'em"
And then they go and smile up in your face just like awesome
Great, wait, police and a thug cannot relate
I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate
So I'ma keep on livin my life from day to day
Learn from my mistakes
