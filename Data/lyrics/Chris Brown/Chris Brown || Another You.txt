[Verse:]
You're a breath of fresh air
I need you without you I can't live
You're in cahoots with my heart ('cause the way you stole it)
Gotta be an inside job
You're a diamond short of perfect
But your body still sparkles
I'm on a knee holding your left hand
I knew where that missing diamond should

[Hook:]
Go ooh oh ooh oh oh oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
I didn't think so

[Chorus:]
Feel like I just won the lotto
I found a 1 in a million you (oh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold
There will never be another you (ooh)
Never be another you (Woahh)
Never be another you

Now I can spend my whole life
Searching for something that's better than my dear
But that's a waste of my time ('cause what's better than perfect love)
Nothing, that's what my point is
You can stand in front of the mirror
And there wouldn't be a reflection (no)
Cause there's only one you
And that's why I never let you

[Hook:]
Go ooh oh ooh oh oh oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you?
Grow ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
I didn't think so (Noo)

[Chorus:]
Feet like I just won the lotto
I found a 1 in a million you (oh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould
There will never be another you (ooh)
Never be another you (Woahh)
Never be another you

[Breakdown: x2]
I'm a firm believer
In never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say whatever
Man it don't even matter
Cause I know our love is true

(Yeah)

[Chorus:]
Feel like I just won the lotto
I found a 1 in a million you (oh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold
There will never be another you (ooh)
Never be another you (Woahh)
Never be another you
(Woah woah oh) [x5]
There will never be another you
(Woah woah oh) [x5]
There will never be another you...
