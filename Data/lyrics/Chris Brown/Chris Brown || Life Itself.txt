[Verse 1 - Chris Brown]
It kills me to see you cry
Even more when I tell a lie
And it's always something I do, to you baby
And I'm so sorry for all the things that I did
And I can't say goodbye or let you just walk away
So I'll admit my wrongs and I hope you hear this
Cause it's a song I made for you
And I'm hoping maybe I could win back your heart
So please don't say goodbye I know that loves still there somewhere

[Chorus:]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
Cause I love you more than life itself

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
Just want you on my team girl
And I don't give a damn about nothing else but the way I feel with you
It's so amazing yeah
If I never get to see you oh
Then I might as well never even know open my eyes
I love you so that I can't let you go
And I ain't trying to be selfish no
Just here to tell you that you got my heart
And only you can tear it apart

[Chorus]

Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
Cause I love you more than life itself

[Verse 3 - Kevin McCall]
Make it easy, easy to love ya
So I ain't gotta look no where else
I know I felt the right one, call me crazy
But I love my baby more than anything
And something's taking over
Anything you want I'll hand it over
Imma ride this thing till the wheels fall off
Till the end of time I'm forever yours

[Chorus]

Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
Cause I love you more than life itself
Ohh no I love you more than life itself
