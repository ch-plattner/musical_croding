
She's like a diamond in the rough, she's my passion;
Super Nova the brightest star, the main attraction
Only she motivates my heart to beat like it's pacing
So I put her up on a pedestal,
All up under her like a basement
But I wonder if she'll notice me

Yeah, that girl I see her,
And baby I promise I will make you a believer tonight
This an introduction to your seduction,
I promise you'll be alright

[Chorus:]
You are treating me like I'm see through, just like I'm see through
My heart breaks like I'm made of glass
Girl, you are treating me like I'm see through, just like I'm see through
You're just like adrenaline babe

My desire, infrared on ya heart, I see its fire
And I just want to cool you down
Baby just hear me out, I think that she's looking right now
Baby all I want to do is save ya,
And if this is a dream don't wanna wake up from this,
Come here, can you hear me, can you see me, my dear

Yeah, that girl I see her,
And baby I promise I will make you a believer tonight
This an introduction to your seduction,
I promise you'll be alright, yeah

[Chorus]

What I gotta do for you to notice me
I'm Breezy ain't nobody cold as me
With all this ice on I'm supposed to freeze
But I put that fur on call it polar b
E.A.R. she play hard,
Worship her she should play God
Fresh cut I'm a king call me Caesar
Need to listen up H.E.A.R.
Ha, I could've picked her, but a nigga really wanted you
Only had one whip first, but fuck it
I don't mean to curse, now I got a few
A couple cribs, some banging views, the only thing missing
In it is me and you, but while I swim in it
You can see the pool, but I live in a glass house
I'm see through ha

[Chorus]
