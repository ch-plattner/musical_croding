[Verse 1:]
Came here tonight
Knew I would see you but
I wasn't quite ready for it (No)
These feelings I can't ignore (cause)
The two us are over
But I'm not sure if I'm over you baby
I made the mistake
When I upped and walked away now
I wish I had (One more chance)

[Chorus:]
One, one more chance to tell you
Baby I know better
Cause now I see that you are the girl
And I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over cause I wish I had one

[Verse 2:]
One more night to talk late on the phone, and more
One more smiling face
Like that ones you used to put on the bottom of your notes
Oh one more touch
One more hug, ooooh
Don't even talk about a kiss
I can't help but reminisce
Cause I wish I had

[Repeat Chorus (2x)]

[Bridge:]
Baby oh baby,
I know I stated we needed sometime apart
But seeing you has got me on a mission
I'm just wishing
Maybe just maybe you'll realize it
And let me back in your heart
I'm at your mercy ooh girl
I wish I had one

[Repeat Chorus (2x)]
