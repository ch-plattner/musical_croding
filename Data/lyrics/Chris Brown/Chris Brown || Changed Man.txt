I've been waiting
For the time to pass
And Let it fade in
But Baby, my patience
Is driving me crazy
Making me feel apart

What do you do
When the truth isn't
Quiet enough?
They looking at you
Telling you
We need to break it up
You need to trust what you do
It's you and me my love
But Ima make it up to you
And show the world

I'm a changed man
Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love [x6]
Can we love again
Girl I know I told you
Baby this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

I remember your touch
God I miss u so much
Please believe me
Baby I'm sorry
And all of this money and fame
Can never amount
To every moment when I see your face

What do you do?
When the truth isn't
Quiet enough?
They looking at you
Telling you
We need to break it up
You need to trust what you do
It's you and me my love
But Ima make it up to you
And show the world
I'm a changed man
Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love [x6]
Can we love again
Girl I know I told you
Baby this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

Saying I'm sorry
Doesn't make it alright
I know [x2]
But I believe that we can make it
If we try
If we try
Yeah, yeah
Wooaaaah

I'm a changed man
Cause you mean much to meee
And I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love [x6]
Can we love again
Girl I know I told you
Baby this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over
It ain't over
Ohhhhhh... 
It ain't over
It ain't over.!!
