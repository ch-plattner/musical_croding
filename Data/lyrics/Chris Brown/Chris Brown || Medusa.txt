Innocent... Heaven sent... That's the way she look... (Look...)
Make you turn... around again... Take a second look... (Look...)
Caught my eye... walkin' by... out there like she modelin'... (And I just had to have her...)

My favorite thing to watch on her is her legs...
But I love everything about her. There's nothin' to replace...
So I call her over to my whip... (To my whip...)
Tryna see what da business is...

Then she hopped up in my ride, ride...
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes...
She cold as ice. Turned me to stone, stone...
Couldn't move... 'Cuz the way she rockin' them Jimmy Choo's... I call her...

Medusa... She da typa girl dat seduce ya... (She is...)
She dat typa girl...
She dat typa girl dat'll turn you into stone...
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone...

She a medusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya
She the, she the type of girl
She the type of girl that will turn you in a stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone

Shawty got what I want. I got what she need... (Need...)
But I don't mind if she take advantage of me... ('Cuz...)
She got that bomb shit... I'm talkin' atomic... My playa days are demolished...

She dun took me out tha game... Now she packin' heat, gunnin' for my last name...
I can't even lie. Shawty got some great aim...
Gotta keep her lookin' good... Man, she really had me hooked...

Then she hopped up in my ride, ride...
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes...
She cold as ice. Turned me to stone, stone...
Couldn't move... 'Cuz the way she rockin' them Jimmy Choo's... I call her...

Medusa... She da typa girl dat seduce ya... (She is...)
She dat typa girl...
She dat typa girl dat'll turn you into stone...
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone...

She a medusa
She the type of girl that seduce ya
She the, she the type of girl
She the type of girl that will turn you in a stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone

(Tell me how she alwayz getz a shoppin spree... outta me... Yeah...)
I Louis Vuitton her... Dolce & Gabbana...
Gucci or Prada, shawty get anything she wanna...
(Don't know how she alwayz getz a shoppin spree... outta me... Yeah...)
It don't matter what it costed... Money ain't an object...
She wear it the best, so she get it when she want it...
