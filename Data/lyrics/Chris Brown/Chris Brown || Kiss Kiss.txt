She want that lovey dovey

In her mind she fantasize

They wanna diss this, kiss-kiss
Cause she mine and so fine
And thick as can be [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I'm a country boy from Tappahannock
Va is where I reside so shawty understand it
And I know I just turned 18
And I get a little mannish
And you see this bandanna hanging
That means I'm like a bandit (like a bandit, bandit)

[Vamp:]

The Lamborghini

And I know what you want

[Chorus x2]
