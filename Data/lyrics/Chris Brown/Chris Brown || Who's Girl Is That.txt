I said to myself
Girl who you looking good for?
Who you talking to?
Who that fella is standing right next to you? (ooh ooh)

[Verse 1]
Look at me, silly me
got me thinking bout changing the game
And I can't let
you get away
so I said..
hello, hello,
Girl, what's your name?

[Chorus:]
(Who's girl is that... who's girl is that, you're supposed to (yeah) be the one, I'm needing that.
(I wonder) I wonder who she talking to on the phone (mmmmmm)
I know it's not me, so I'm tryin' to get on
(Stop playing mama) Come over here
(You need to go ahead) and throw that number
(This love is crazy) Let's work something out
(I wanna work something out) Let's work something out, baby

[Verse 2]
The time is right now
You ain't gotta look at me with a frown
Or sucking you lips
all you gotta do is say no or yea yo
And we can go, all the way to the top
ain't nothing wrong with that
Can't let you get away
so I said hello, hello
Girl what's your name
