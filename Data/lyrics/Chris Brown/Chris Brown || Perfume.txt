I know you want me girl
You think about me in your mind, am I right? yeah
I think about you too
I'm feelin' right here deep inside, it's all right yeah

And you tellin' me things that you wanna do
And I got plans to do things too
You know I wonder why you took so long and made me have to wait
Tell me where we start

[Rich Girl]
Let's sit down i need to kill time
Sweep me off my feet after some wine
Slowly please undress me
I ain't even playin' when I say
We startin' now

[Chris Brown]
Round and round, up and down, up in this bed
I don't want you to forget

[Rich Girl]
Hope you remember my perfume, on you
After I

[Chris Brown]
Sex you down
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Hope you come back for more

[Rich Girl]
Will you remember my perfume on you?
After I

[Chris Brown]

Tonight I'm pretty much ready

[Chris Brown and Rich Girl]
To do what you want me to
Do what you want me to

Tonight I'm pretty much ready

To do what you want me to

[Chris Brown]
In the middle of the night when I call your phone
I love it when you tell me "come get it I'm alone"
'Cause you know I can go all night
Before i leave ima give you bragin rights

[Rich Girl]
Let's sit down and need to kill time
Sweep me off my feet after some wine

We can do it all over the house
It's evidence from what we did on the couch

[Rich Girl]
It's on the counters in the kitchen
My love is what you missin'
And every pillow in this condolea down

[Chris Brown and Rich Girl]
Down on your body when you wake up

[Rich Girl]
So as my lip gloss and my makeup
You can see

[Chris Brown]
You cannot wait

[Rich Girl]
Don't wanna escape
