
Get fresh baby this is your song,
Put your good shoes and your lipstick on,
Get fresh baby this is your song,
You said you want a freak, I'mma give you what you want. 
Whole lot of sex, whole lot of liquor,
Whole lot of chicks, not a lot of niggas,
Not my party, all about the bitches,
Sexy model, ass like Alicia's,
See my main chick, she got that good shit,
And her gang vicious so I call her sid,
Girl you better be careful,
Bragging on a dick now your friends want a sample,
Fuck a 69, its 696,
I be the 9, both ya'll the 6,
You go both ways, get a load of this,
Beat it so hard, now she gotta take a piss,
Then you can't even walk in the morning,
Go to work yawning, :
Man your girlfriends on it,
Ain't no fun if you ain't sharing with the homies.

[Chorus:]
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz.

I'ma have you telling all the business,
By the way that I be giving you the business,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz.

When my jeans come down, the surfs coming up,
Thong to the side, she feel it in her guts,
Ass in the air, fucking up your weave,
Pulling on your hair baby let me hear you scream,
This white game mean, I make a bitch cry,
I lick your lips to your tits to your thighs,
Throw you on your side, I'm working out the kinks,
You sweating out the sheets, girl you fucking with a freak,
She told you I'm a beast? well, she ain't never lie,
I can go on both of you at the same time,
Taking that pussy, bitch this mine,
Throw that shit back, put an arch in your spine,
I never waste time but I ain't in a rush,
Hit it like a champ, I beat the pussy up,
He give you little taps, I beat the pussy up,
Got her telling all her friends how the kid do her stuff.

[Chorus:]
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz,
How freaky I'm iz.

I'ma have you telling all the business,
By the way that I be giving you the business,
I'll make you run and tell your friends
