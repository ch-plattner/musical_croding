[Verse 1:]
Ha! Hot damn, you look so appalled
My girl is the shit, your girl has no ass at all
Her booty super thick but her tummy super small
And when she dancin' her booty swallow up her draws
Yeah buddy in the club I do my dougie
Bottle in my hand mean muggin' like I'm ugly
Only models in my section get them uglies way from me
And when they be like, I just play dummy.
In the party got them white girls rolling like whoa
In the morning they be like where the fuck are my clothes
Please don't tell nobody cause I don't really do this,
Sure, what you think Iâ€™m stupid
I told her, just to call me dada
But shorty spanish so she wanna call me papa
Or papi never met a nigga like me
I swept her up so I guess she had light feet

[Chorus:]
Can we make this an after party
Cause yo body all on me
My head spinning round and round
Can we make this a nasty party
Cause I just want ya body on mine body on mine
And take me down take me down now

[Verse 2:]
Vans on, so I get my dance on
She said she fucked the whole crew I put my mans on
I threw my money on the table told her to dance on it
I pull that monster out, she put her hands on it.
Pool party shawty going gnarly
Only fuck with rock stars and them boys whose riding harleys
Bitch I'm on ya camera, no not iCarly
When she turn 21, I'm a drown her with bacardi
Mmmmm hhhhhmmm, 151 heart beatin like a drum
And my face is kinda numb
Stop that shit where that hatin coming from
Oh you mad cause I got your girl faced in my cum

[Chorus:]
Can we make this an after party
Cause your body all on me
My head spinning round and round
Can we make this a nasty party
Cause I just want your body on mine body on mine
And take me down take me down down
