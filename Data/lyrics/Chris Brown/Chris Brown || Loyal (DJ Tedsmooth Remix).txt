Who y'all talkin to man?

[Sheek Louch (Chris Brown) {DJ Tedsmooth}]
Uh Uh! L.O.X. (Yeah! Let me see!)
You know we had to do this right? REMIX! {TED SMOOTH! STRAIGHT FACE! U REMEMBER!!!}

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch {Chris Brown}]
Hey! Feelin like I just got signed (Yeah!)
Feelin like these hoes all mine
Ha! But I know they ain’t loyal (Uh Uh)
If I leave ‘em out too long they’ll spoil {Ohhh}
Oh-Oh-Oh! I can tell she want a though though (Ha!)
Burner on me mad ice in my hublot
WOO! Had to take her to my other crib
Never bring her ‘round where my baby live
Pop bottles get a dutch let’s burn up
Fuck a movie all she wanna do is turn up (Turn up)
She just wanna come to my shows
I’d done did everything but trust these hoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown {Sheek Louch}]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (ohhh)
These hoes ain't loyal... (I got a story to tell) {REMIX} (whoooa)
Those hoes ain't loyal...

[Verse 2: Styles P {Chris Brown}]
Let the pound cake and the clear wax oil you (haha)
Used to sling girl out aluminum foil
Got your bitch out like she just got boiled (ha!)
Man she want me to play with her
I just lit up a J with her {yeah}
Now she want me to stay with her 
Better have four other bitches to lay with her (better)
Cause my wife gon' kill me (kill me)
Got five bitches to hit she might feel me {ohhh}
But them hoes ain’t loyal (uh-uh)
Get down and dirty somethin' like soil (nope)
You a rich nigga, they foil you 
You a broke nigga won’t call you 

[Chorus: Chris Brown {Sheek Louch}]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (ohhh)
These hoes ain't loyal... (I got a story to tell) {REMIX} (whoooa)
These hoes ain't loyal... (yea-yeah - let me see)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss {Chris Brown}]
Stayin out night with the ballers
You a creep you get right to the crawlers (Hmmm)
Thought you was in The Heights with Toya (Yup)
You in the shorts then letting niggas dog ya  {Ohhh}
And that’s a fact
I took a rich nigga bitch then I passed her back
We just did a couple shots blew half a sack
Think about it all the time ‘cause her ass was fat {Yeah}
Got you open like a kid in the candy store
Or you stay away from it they just hand you more
They don't own that life, you'll understand me more
You just need to know that her pussy can’t be yours 
SUCKA!

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl - why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl - why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it's all for nothing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown] 
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (I got a story to tell)  (ohhh)
These hoes ain't loyal... (whoooa)
These hoes ain't loyal... (yea-yeah - let me see)
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (ohhh)
These hoes ain't loyal... (whoooa)
These hoes ain't loyal... (yea-yeah - let me see)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Yeah! Let me see! Yeah! Let me see! 
Yeah! Let me see! (Oh these hoes ain’t loyal) Let me see!
