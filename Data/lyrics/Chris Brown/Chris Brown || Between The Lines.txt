
Was it something I said
Was it something I did (oh)
Looking for an answer
Cause I don't even know
Why you're so upset with me
Girl what is this about
Them other shawtys
I don't care about

[Hook:]
Baby sit down
Only when we sexing is when
I want to hear you yelling out loud
Countdown
Backwards from ten now ain't that much better
Break down
Every little word
She said this, he said that
Don't believe none of them lies

[Chorus:]
Wasting time
Fightin over shit that don't even really matter
Wish I could start a brand new chapter
I done seen this kind of thing before
I already know how this story unfolds
All I wanna do is love you right
Take my time
Read between the lines
Girl (read between the lines)
Read between the lines
Girl

Here we go again
Heard it all before
It's getting us nowhere fast
So, let's retrace our steps
And figure out where we went wrong
Girl
Let's talk this through

[Hook]

[Chorus]
