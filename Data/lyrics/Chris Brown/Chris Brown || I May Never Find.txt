I enjoy you
I never want to see you leave girl
You made my life so complete and I don't want to move too fast no
'Cause you're too special

[chorus:]
I really love the way (I do)
You make me feel inside you wonder why my spirit is so happy
You touched my heart
Every part
Whenever you speak to me
I love what we have going on
I may never find another one like you
For me

I have no worries
Once I step into your presences
You have a way of helping me
See that everything's OK
What else can I say?

[chorus]

We started out
Saying (saying)
That we would just be friends
But special feelings
Have arisen
What are we suppose to do now
Here in the mean while?

I really love the way (I do)
You make me feel inside you wonder why my spirit is happy
'Cause you came in
And changed the meaning
Of a true friend
And this is just the beginning

You touched my heart
Every part
Whenever you speak to me
I love what we have going on
I may never find another one like you for me

I may never find another one like you for me
I may never find another one like you for me
I may never find another one like you for me
