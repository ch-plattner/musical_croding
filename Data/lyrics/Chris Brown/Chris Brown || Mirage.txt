[Verse 1:]
Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open, closing the blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet bullet out right here
Change your body I need adviser
Hard to beat but fuck it don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
Nigga gun gun pow

[Pre Chorus:]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo you gets no love, no love nah
Must be coo koo got me fucked up, fucked up wow
(You got em fucked up)
You know a nigga ain't gonna hold ya, hold ya down

[Chorus:]
I'm a mirage, what? fuck I look like
I'm a mirage, what the fuck I look like
It's all in your mind, your mind
What I look like? Open your eyes, you're blind
What the fuck up I look like

[Verse 2:]
Yeah yeah you're mind said I should apologize to ya
People telling all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe em all don't wanna accept the truth
Who the fuck you're kidding, kidding
What's the use
Sad to see you playing the fool
You don't know half the shit a nigga been through
I guess you got your reward, reward
For the acting like you don't need me babe

[Pre Chorus:]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo you gets no love, no love nah
Must be coo koo got me fucked up, fucked up wow
(You got em fucked up)
You know a nigga ain't gonna hold ya, hold ya down
Excuse my French but...

[Chorus:]
I'm a mirage, what? fuck I look like
I'm a mirage, what the fuck I look like
It's all in your mind, your mind
What I look like? Open your eyes, you're blind
What the fuck up I look like

[Nas:]
You're looking for love and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rapping
My body wrapped in Sir Valentino, Laura piano fashion
Sex with passion, romancing laughing
Happiness, action, restaurants relaxing
They got some good sushi and aspen
A good pussy I'm smashin
I call you Masa LIsa yeah I'm your visa
American express I must confess
I'll try to go beyond love
And this is hard to translate
Love is good but to me good is just an enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top
But you don't' got what it take to be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star
You was my sister, you was my soldier
Damn I used to miss you
I used to love you
I think to hold you
You didn't know me it was only just a mirage, mirage

[Chorus:]
You didn't know me it was only just a mirage, mirage
What the fuck I look like
It's all in your mind, your mi-ind
What I look like? Open your eyes, you're blind
What the fuck I look like?
Yeah

What the fuck I look like?
What the fuck I look like?
Fucked up
