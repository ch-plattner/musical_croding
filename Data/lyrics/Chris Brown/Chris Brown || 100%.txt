[Kevin McCall:]
Beats I be serving sex beefs...
Diamonds got so many cuts call my jeweler to surgeon
Ain't nobody fucking with me label me the virgin
I'm hot burning, like when you leave a perm in
Everywhere I go these hoes be digging in they purses for a shark
Because they tryin' get the autograph of person
Little bit of coke mix with a lot of bourbon
Got your boy leaning sorry if my words slurin
Swervin' in that DV9 on purpose
The roof disappear call it magic like irvin johnson
Get above my johnson, know my rider dick Shawty this ain't magic mountain
I've been killing, killing every song that I been spitting on
And if I ain't spitting, better something that I written on
Can't even say it was a long road getting on
Only took a year and a half and now I'm shitting on

[Hook:]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building
I'm a giant in the woods to the minks (tell her)
Money talk so don't say nothing unless you talk business
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
I go

Let me count this money, 1 million, 2 million
Put this up for my new car, save that for my baby mama
And all you bums keep the change

[Chris Brown:]
Yeah, I got them bullet proof ray bans so haters never in my head
Money hungry good for me, yeah I call it week bread
Ladies say I'm long show king yeah that's what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fucking on that king spread
Haha
Big balling, fuck a loaf, and money turn me on
So I had to fuck it off, skinny ass niggers pockets looking so bulimic
And I'm never spill my drink, you can call me temperpedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You watching while I'm laughing cause all of you niggers is funny
And they call me Action Jackson cause every day I'm stunting
And I'm writing hit songs like it's nothing
So nigger you bugging, fronting
What you think this is hoe?
Paparazzi trying to pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker no lame mad nigger
And your flow is what a dam then a drain ass nigger

[Hook:]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building
I'm a giant in the woods to the minks (tell her)
Money talk so don't say nothing unless you talk business
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go)
I go
