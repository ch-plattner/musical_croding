
More money, more riches,
More freaky, model misses.
Six-four booty make you hit switches,
Shawty sitting on forty inches.
I like her, she like me,
I wanna love her, she wanna love me!
That happening is unlikely,
I gotta throw away silly thing likes weed
Spinning like a tornado,
Then I eat it up like it's gourmet food
Then I beat it up like boom, boom, boom,
Then I get girls lyin' soon
Climb on top of me, underneath the sheets,
Cause I'm about to take you down,
And change your last name to Mrs. Brown.

[Hook: x2]
She know she can get it, get it,
She know she can get it, get it,
She know she can get it, get it,
So I'm a give it to her,
Like that I'm in Kamasutra

If I don't give it to her,
She gonna take it,
But when she do it to you
She'll be faking.
She's a five star chick on my A list,
I'll have her body bent over like the Matrix.
I ain't mad at you, do your thing, girl!
I bet you never had an R&B singer
I promise you will never goin' back,
So let me hit it out the park
We go B.A., L.A., New York, Atlanta,
Houston Chi-town rollin' on a tour bus
I seen a lot of ladies but I'm feelin' you
I've gotta let you know

[Hook: x2]
She know you can get it, get it!
She know she can get it, get it,
She know she can get it, get it,
So I'm a give it to her
Like that I'm in Kamasutra
