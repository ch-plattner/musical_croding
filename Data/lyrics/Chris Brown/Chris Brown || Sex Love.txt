When you showing me all the ways to love
Damn it drives me crazy I cant get enough
So many before never really sure but you showed me baby

[Chorus]
What it really means to give your heart to someone
Cant even lie that was something I've never done
Until you came along and made me better I don't have to look farther girl
Yes its true
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love (give it all to you)
Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I
I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I sex love

[Chris Brown]
Imma be your heart
You can read my mind
I don't understand it but I let it slide
Anything you want baby ill do it
I know what real love is and girl we gonna make some
I know that I'm gonna please your body leaving you wanting more
I'm sure
Girl don't worry we don't have to hurry and ill never go no where

[Chorus]
What it really mean to give your heart to someone
Cant even lie that was something I've never done
Until you came along and made me better I don't have to look farther girl
Yes it true
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love (give it all to you)
Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I
I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I sex love

[Seven]
Finally found someone who appreciates what I do
So many other miss out on love and they don't have a clue
Unbelieve you wanted me
And I know I'm Sane right here laying with you (oh with you)

[1/2 Chorus]
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love (give it all to you)
Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I
I know you love it when
I promise I promise I promise I sex love
