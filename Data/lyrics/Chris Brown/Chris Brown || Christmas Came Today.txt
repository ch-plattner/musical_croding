Baby love, how you been doing?
Have you been naughty or nice, baby?
Tell me what are we doing?
It's snowing, all this beautiful music
And when I unwrap a present tonight, you gonna be the one, listen to me now

I want you to...

Do you want me, boy?
Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Girl, Just kiss me, Oh baby
Under the mistletoe

And we can both say, Christmas came today,
And we both say, Christmas came today
Baby love, you know I'm hungry
Your bra and panties fit right
But girl I just wanna taste your cookies
(they won't hear a sound)
I'm like oh no, she come back like a yo yo
Girl I don't make it rain, I make you snow
Do you want me to start, then you tell me no,
Your love it so hard that the tree fell on the floor

I want you to

Do you want me, boy?
Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Just kiss me, Oh baby
Girl you want me more

Oh baby, we can both say Christmas came today
We can both say Christmas came today

I want you to,

Do you want me, boy
Take it off
Do you want me, boy?
Just kiss me, oh baby
