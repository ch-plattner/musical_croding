Girl, I ain't running game... 
But there's a couple things I like, I try to explain
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you
In fact I like your style
Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, oooooh, and baby here's the deal

I'll be right here
Tell the sun and the moon and the stars they all refuse to shine
(I'll be right here)
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
(I'll be right here)
Girl i wanna be apart of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me!

You don't have to be afraid to say what's on your mind
Your body language's tellin me, let's take our time
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you
In fact I like your style
Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, oooooh, and baby here's the deal

I'll be right here
Tell the sun and the moon and the stars they all refuse to shine
(I'll be right here)
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
(I'll be right here)
Girl i wanna be apart of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me! yeeeah
