
We're in the mother fucking building!
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
I need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models

Oh my god waiter! We packed up in this bitch!
And I'm feeling hater vapors yeah it's hot up in this bitch!
But you will never phase me
And I know why you hate me
Cause my fucking cleaning lady
Look hotter than your bitch,
And you know I'm about to spend
A hundred rocks upon this bar, R bar.
You don't wanna drink you wanna be nosey Ms. Aardvark
And I know that you not used to rejection
But if you don't get naked get the fuck up out my section!

[Chorus:]
I'mma need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
I need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models

All up in the VIP that shit look like a cloud
Guess Aladdin got two hundred Jazmines coming to the house.
And we're banging on that magic carpet fucking on the couch
All the better genies say she saw a genie, that's that loud
They say silence is gold, told my queen don't make a sound
But these bottles I'm holding I'mma give 'em to the crowd!
Ah, that must be the shit they're talking about
Can you hear me now or I gotta say it loud?

[Chorus:]
I need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models

I see you standing in the back, babe
Let me help you out with that babe, you looking badder than the biz
Baddest in the click, see you're picking up your slack babe
So let me take you back to my place
So drunk, so high, babe
We can do this over and over, I ain't got no hang over
You can tell by the look on my face I need

[Chorus:]
I need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
I need a hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
A hundred fucking bottles
Stuntin' is my motto, with 200 bad models
