
Uhh, Uhh
Well done
Finish him

[Chorus]
Snapbacks back, Snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches no I'm the shit
25 for the belt nigga get off my dick.
I brought the snapbacks back, snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches no I'm the shit
25 for the belt nigga get off my dick.

[Verse 1 - Tyga]
I brought the snapbacks back. snapbacks back
Man all these niggas foul like hack a shaq
Nigga racks on racks
My bitch ass so fat
Your bitch booty like a pancake flat flap jack
I make your dollars collapse
Trail low in the strap
Shells big as a turtle
Master splinter to rap
Spi, spi, spi, spin you like Urkel
Your body hanging from fat
Thought you was sharper than tacks
Get you thrown like some jacks.
All these bitches with these tassels on they titties tryna tax
I don't give a fuck if none of yall don't rap
I can pull a bitch just turning my back
Who do that? Venus trap
Flyest nigga in the class
Goyard bag, see that tag?
I can pay your rent all year, boy.
Yo momma know,
Yo cousin, sister, brother and yo momma know,
Yo cousin, sister, brother, and yo momma know,
Yo cousin, sister, brother and yo momma know,
Bitch yo granny know, nigga.

[Chorus]
Snapbacks back, Snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches no I'm the shit
25 for the belt nigga get off my dick.
I brought the snapbacks back, snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, (hahahaha) bitches no I'm the shit (what's hapenin')
25 for the belt, (ight) nigga get off my dick.

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
Leggo,
Snapbacks back, put V.A. on the map
I'm a young nigga heart throb, girls cardiac
I got your girls all on my (dick)
Yea them chickens giving me neck, nigga
You ain't talkin bout shit
Fuck your city, press eject.
To busy coughing up them hairballs
Fur coat, bear dog
Spray these niggas like aerosol,
And fuck them on niggas geritol
Hold up, snapback on,
Champange MCM backpack on
Lucky that my situation in this probation won't even let me strap that tone
My condo ain't no hotter i be right at home,
What you mean nigga I'm coherent
Steeze out with my D out
And you wonder why your shawty be disappearin'
Haha, I brought the snapbacks back
Last kings in them Ti$as, yea they sell like crack.
You got no car insurance, no raybans
This Geico, caveman
First of the month you do a praise dance,
Like you movin' on up, Amen
Stop that drop my hat in the club
They gon' be like that nigga on drugs
Get more respect in L.A. than you do,
And you working for the pubs.

[Chorus]
Snapbacks back, Snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches no I'm the shit
25 for the belt nigga get off my dick.
I brought the snapbacks back, snapbacks back
That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches no I'm the shit
25 for the belt nigga get off my dick.
I brought the...
