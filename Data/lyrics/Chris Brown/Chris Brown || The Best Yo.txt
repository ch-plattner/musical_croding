[Intro:]
I don't know what it is...
It's just something about you...
Ha... I mean I don't think I can be in love this early...
Huh, maybe I can. But you the best.

[Verse 1:]
All of these chances we take from day to day.
Constantly workin', travelin' from place to place.
I wanna find a place where my love can stay,
So you just promise you won't give my love away.
Girl let's get our dance on, and I'm a kiss your neck
And put my hands on your body.

[Hook:]
We can do this thing nice and slow,
We can take it 'round the world let's go.
Girl you know you play the biggest part,
Take it back to the start where we fell in love.
Ooh girl you got that body I can't take it babe,
I want it, I just really really want it.
Got anything you need baby, just come with me baby ha ah...

[Chorus:]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow,
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back.
Because you're special, (aah) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner.
You need a girl who wants you just like that.
Because you're special, (oh) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.

[Verse 2:]
Girl your body matches your face, and I want it all.
Bring yo body over here, I ain't scared to break you off.
I'm bout to go in so hard, deeper and deeper
[Background:] (Givin' it to your body, I love ya body baby)
If me and your body could love exchange,
All these positions girl let's switch it up.

[Hook:]
We can do this thing nice and slow,
We can take it 'round the world let's go.
Girl you know you play the biggest part,
Take it back to the start where we fell in love.
Ooh girl you got that body I can't take it babe,
I want it, I just really really want it.
Got anything you need baby, just come with me baby ha ah...
[Background:] (ooooh... yeah...)

[Chorus:]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow,
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back.
Because you're special, (aah) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner.
You need a girl who wants you just like that.
Because you're special, (oh) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.

[Bridge:]
Can't nobody else, do me like you do.
Make a nigga wanna spend them dolla's on you boo.
Do it by yourself, girl that's all you ooh.
I can't get yo booty out of my mind.
Girl you're a stallion, you know you da truth.

Can we make love right now...
Right now... Right now... Right now...
Owww...

[Chorus:]
It don't matter where we go, London as Heathrow,
I'll take you 'round the world baby and back.
Because you're special, (aah) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.
And you know I'm a go-getter, but shawty is a winner.
You need a girl who wants you just like that.
Because you're special, (oh) you the best yo, (aah) let's go.
