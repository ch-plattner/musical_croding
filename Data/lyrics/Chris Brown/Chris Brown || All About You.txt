How'd did you get so young
I heard that you were born today
Heard that you came from
The sky and I just wanna say
Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day
Sometimes the fire can get in your way
But that ain't nothing
You can't blow away

So make a wish
I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew
How much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you
It's all about you
Today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you
Today, today

Girl what do you want
I swear I'll give you everything
New car parked out front
Flowers, bags and wedding rings
Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day
Sometimes the fire get in the way
But that ain't nothing
You can't blow away

So make a wish
I have one too
I wish I that could stay with you
Wish you knew
How much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you
It's all about you
Today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you
Today
