[Chris Brown]
I'll be swimming in women
And I'd be digging and living
And I'll be whipping the whips that you haven't seen now
Well the quip is just whip it
And make it purr like a kitten
And imma have you addicted to me now
And all the fast girls wanna get money
Baby girl you ain't getting none from me
All you get is this dick
Make it bounce like a bunny
Come on
Tricks are for kids
But feel it in your ribs
Like

Wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait
(breezy)

Kissing under your belly button for about a month or two

[Trey Songz]
Girl I like your face down with your ass up
Do the most get close like Casper
Beat it like a boxer
Eat it like a lobster
Tell me your desires
Get you higher than a rasta
I got something special for you when I get you home
You should let me drive girl the rides really long
If you wanna ride ride ride you can
You just gotta lie lie to your man

I just wanna get a little give a little take a little make a little love all over my crib
Girl if you can take a lot of make a lot of sounds
I'm gonna take your body down and ill pass you on to Chris

[The Game]
I'm in that mocialaco
Riding through Chicago
And its 12:00, 12:00 in my mofato
Yeah I know, b&cb it's like back in back diablos drop the top
Put on the gatos
Swim in the mike phelps
Under my Gucci belt
I said swim
Not unstrap my Gucci belt
More shoppers than Johnny Depp in that mosso
So many game impasso
Riding ram in the boxers
I'm in the Deville
Sipping on Belvedere vodka
So many tricks
Hit 'em in a little bit can't grab banana split
I ain't no chicken
Never been no chicken ish
If I pop a bottle
She a model when she licking it
If I'm going down I'm eating it like ?
Knocking on my dressing room
Just to get freaking Chris
She spilling my Chris
Freaking on my fresh fit
Curve
That's when get on to the next two

I'll be swimming in women
And I'd be digging and living
And I'll be whipping the whips that you haven't seen now
Well the quip is just whip it
And make it purr like a kitten
And imma have you addicted to me now
And all the fast girls wanna get money
Baby girl you ain't getting none from me
All you get is this dick
Make it bounce like a bunny
Come on
Tricks are for kids
But feel it in your ribs
Like

Wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait wait (wait a minute motherfucker)
Wait wait wait
