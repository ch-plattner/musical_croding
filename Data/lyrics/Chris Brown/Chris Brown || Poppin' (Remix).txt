Chris Br-eezy I ... see ya daddy

Ya, right off the bat
I'm a mack
We can get it popping, we can get it crack-in'
And if your man is whack
And if he lack what I pack
Then I will make you lack him
Shorty we can do what you wanna, how you wanna
Where you wanna, when you wanna - ask them
And my clip never droppin'
We can get it poppin' like a mac-ten
Brrrr-Dat Dat Dat on your back back back
I smack smack smack that
And I'm strapped with an automatic tongue
And it goes Brrrr-At-Dat Dat Dat
Now who wanna get shot baby I could tap that
Yup I could tap that (atta?) Rat Pack
I could lay back like a fat cat
But I'm a big dog on any track
Ah- and we got it pumpin' every night every night
When we get into our thing
You know I had to tell them young niggas
When it come to the women I just switch like a mood ring
But I'm rich, I'm high on the food chain
I'm hot, I smoke like two trains
I'm trained, I know how to do things
My thing - hot like blue flame
Flame- the fireman put it out
She hot- the fireman put her out
All she gotta do is call up emergency
And I will be on my way to the house
Knock, Knock -- I know somebody home
Don't leave me knockin' baby
All you gotta do is bring that corn
And we can get it poppin' baby.
