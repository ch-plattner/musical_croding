
Baby I don't like to say goodbye
So this is bye until next time,
I, I see you
Because I don't want to leave you (ooh)
I'll just kiss you one last time
To leave an imprint on your mind,
Girl - just for right now
Tell me can you hold out?

Remember, girl we can be miles apart,
And no matter where you are
You're always in my heart (heart)

Baby don't leave
Baby just stay right here,
Because I ain't going to waste your time
So you don't have to leave my side,
You got me open.

Don't leave
Baby just stay right here
Even if the world goes by
We'll remember one last time
Together

I could cry a thousand tears,
But that won't keep you here
You said you were finished with this love,
So I said why are you givin' up on us (on us)
I'll love you forever I promise,
But to me forever ain't that long
So baby don't you go,

Girl remember (remember)
Girl we can be miles apart,
And no matter where you are
You're always in my heart (my heart)

Baby don't leave,
Baby just stay right here (stay right here)
Because I ain't going to waste your time (noo)
So you don't have to leave my side,
You got me open (yeah)

Don't leave
Baby just stay right here (oh yeah)
Even if the world goes by (by)
We'll remember one last time
Together

Don't leave
Shorty don't leave
Don't leave me,
Don't leave
Shorty don't leave
Don't leave me (yeah)

Baby don't leave (yeah)
Baby just stay right here, (here)
Because I ain't going to waste your time
So you don't have to leave my side,
You got me open.

Don't leave
Baby just stay right here (right here)
Even if the world goes by
We'll remember one last time
Together...
