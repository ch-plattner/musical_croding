[Verse One]
Where you going, slow it
Don't act like you don't see me
I'm glowing, show me
What you look like in the morning
Tone it on it, floating on 25s
I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it

[Bridge]
When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key
When I step through the door all eyes on me
Wanna be a star get on TV
It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me
(Oh baby)

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do (yeah)
The way ya making it move
I'm tryna give it to you (oh)
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)
Tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome
And I'm tryna get at ya
(Hey) I want ya girl
(You) You feel me girl
(Move, oh you) I'm on ya
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)
Tryna get at ya (hey hey hey hey)
You see me sitting on chrome
And I'm tryna get at ya

[Verse Two]
Girl I'm slowly approaching
Dodging those misdemeanors
They on it, (on it) want it (want it)
I know they waiting on me
To run it, run it
You gotta show me
If you with it be a bad girl

[Bridge]
When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key (low key)
When I step through the door all eyes on me (on me)
Wanna be a star get on TV
It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me (hey girl)

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do
The way ya making it move (the way that you move it)
I'm tryna give it to you (I can't take it baby)
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)
Tryna get at ya (oh girl)
You see me sitting on chrome
And I'm tryna get at ya ( baby)
(Hey) I want ya girl
(You) You feel me girl
(Move, oh you) I'm on ya
Said girl tryna get at ya
Tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome (I'm tryna get at ya)
And I'm tryna get at ya

[Chris' Rap]
700 horsepower
Speakers beating down the block
Girls stop automatic static
Better call the cops
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it
I'm gonna have to snatch it
But I'm tryna get at ya
200 miles per hour
Speakers beating down the block
Girls stop automatic static
Better call the cops
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it
I'm gonna have to snatch it
But I'm tryna get at ya

[Chorus]
Hey girl I love what you do
The way ya making it move
I'm tryna give it to you
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)
Tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome
And I'm tryna get at ya
(Hey) I want ya girl
(You) You feel me girl
(Move, oh you) I'm on ya
Said girl tryna get at ya
Tryna get at ya
You see me sitting on chrome (I'm tryna get at ya)
And I'm tryna get at ya

[x2]
Tryna give it to you
Do you feel me girl
Tryna give it to you
Do you feel me girl
Tryna give it to you
Do you feel me girl
Do you feel me girl
Do you feel me girl
