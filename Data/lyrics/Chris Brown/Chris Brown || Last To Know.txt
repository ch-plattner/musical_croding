Girl I know lately
We havent talked much
Cause I been away
So we been outta touch
But that doesnt mean I don't love ya
It doesnt mean I'm not always thinkin of ya
Oohh
I told people that I miss you
They sayin that you
Been actin real different
Now everybodys lookin at me like I'm crazy
Tellin me you got something that you wanna say to me

Whooo oh
Tell me why was I the last to know
That you got plans of walkin out my door
Don't do this to me (no)
Girl talk to me (no)
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who
Had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walkin out my door
Don't do this to me (no)
Girl talk to me (no)
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the last to know

I'm takin the red out to be more
You sayin I was bein less but I'm tryna be more (be more)
Oh
Girl I didn't know
I was always gone
You were lonely so you found somebody else to hold on
You wanna show me how it feels to be all alone
Tryna make it right with you
I don't wanna fight with you
Hey hey
And I damn sure don't wanna spend my life
Wishin to spend my life with you
Yea

Tell me why was I the last to know (tell me why was I the last)
That you got plans of walkin out my door (didn't know it)
Don't do this to me (no no)
Girl talk to me (I hate)
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who (I hate that I'm the guy who)
Had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walkin out my door
Don't do this to me (no)
Girl talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the last to know

Picture of production tryna let all my stupid adolescence go
I wanna be a man about it
Even though I know your heart says no
Girl Im no good without ya
Let me wrap my heart around ya
Cuz your my baby girl, put your bags on the floor
Tell me what I did to get us to this harm
Didnt know the clock was ticking that came for me
I need ya babe!
Im breaking down (Ooooh)
So tell me

Tell me why was I the last to know
That you got plans of walkin out my door
Don't do this to me (no)
Girl talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the guy who
Had to be the last to know
That you got plans of walkin out my door
Don't do this to me (no)
Girl talk to me
You don't have to leave
Can't believe that I'm the last to know
