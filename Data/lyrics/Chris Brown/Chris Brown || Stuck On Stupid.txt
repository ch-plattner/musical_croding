[Verse 1:]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you
That's for sure
(Ooh babe)
But your beauty,
That is in me
Makes me forget about your faults
You do no wrong
Ooh woah ooh oh hoh oh

[Bridge:]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to,
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you,
No lie
And girl I loose it every time

[Hook:]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me

[Verse 2:]
It's confusing,
How you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul,
Yeah baby
And I'll do anything for you,
Ooh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love,
I'm stupid

[Bridge]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to,
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you,
No lie
And girl I loose it every time

[Hook]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Ooh ooh ooh
Look what you do to me

[Verse 3:]
If you told me to go rock climbing
To prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying
Got everything to lose
I'm gon' try to play it cool
The stupid things I do,
I do it for you

[Hook]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me
