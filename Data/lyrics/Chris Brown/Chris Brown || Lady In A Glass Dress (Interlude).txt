Lady in a glass dress
I can see right through you
You act like you don't want this
But you know that you do
Since he broke your heart, girl
You say you'll never love again
And you won't let it stop girl
But we know in the end

You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true

Oh, oh
Lady in the glass dress
Oo, oo
