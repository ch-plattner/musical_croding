Patron mixed with me that’s your recipe

So when you’re leaving that party baby
Come right over, we can get it started baby, like

Ohh, if it’s loving that you need, from me
Come close, cause your happiness all that matters to me

And when I break you off, you be calling me baby

And drinking a little too much
You’re talking crazy is all on your head
You’re tipsy and ready for loving
So you’re calling me over
