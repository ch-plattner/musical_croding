Black Benz
You repent
Give a fuck about this paper
Say you're girl is a fan now that bitch up at my table
Everyday the same cycle
Got the weed, got the liquor, got the swishers and these bitches we gone pull an all nighter
Doing this shit for VA
Two hundred on the freeway
They blowing up my phone cause they tryna get a 3-way
This shit looking like a relay
She already chose cause it's too many niggas but it's not enough hoes
Goddamnit I know you can't stand it while I discommand it 
I do damage and she pull her panties down to the floor she let me cut
Think I needa bend it
Drop the pussy bend it
If yo nigga tripping 40 on him 
tell me when to go
I put five hundred thousand on you
Why you rented four
If that shit is yours
Then what it's tented for
Throw that westside up 
With them lamborghini doors
And I step right up
I make it rain I make it pour huh
Who a low-life 
Nigga get it straight
All this ice 
In ya face
All this money
I don't need a safe
How you talking money to a fucking bank
Now throw a couple bands on it 
Walk the plank, walk the plank 
Yea stand on it
That's your bitch, I'm sorry she put her hands on it
I know you hating
But you know you a fan homie
Okay I love them asian, Love them red dots
She give me brains what I call her headshots
Them white girls say they love tupac
It's hella back bitches all up on this white yacht 
Yea because its snapbacks and tattoos
Girl take them tights off 
Gone let that ass loose
This a tax write off
You I'm that dude
And my flow is ewrr like that pink thing on that baboon 
Shitty, My niggas with me riding for my city
Got Virginia on my back
My autograph across her titty
Pop that pussy like I pop a wheelie 
Always beatin, I committed
On the dick acting silly
Gone girl get it, get it
Fuck being low-key
I be on that loud pack
All this smoke up in the air
Can't see where the crowd at 
Thinking you gone drink for free
Bitch I can't I allow that
Real nigga section 
Bitch you are around that
