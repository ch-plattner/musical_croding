[Verse 1:]
She look up from the book she was readin
With the prettiest smile that I ever saw
Curly hair down back
And the skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw
And then those eyes
Made my heart stop in my chest
And she said "Hi"
And it was hard to catch my breath

I said "Hey lil mama
I don't mean to bother at all, My name is Chris" (hello, hello)
And before she could answer,
I said "Listen to this: I think you're fineee"
And she cracked that smile again
Et's say goodbye to my homies and your friends

[Chorus:]
We can dip out alone (keep it movin)
Do something fun (& keep it movin)
Talk about life
About love
That's wats up
Keep it movin (ohh)
Don't matter at all (all) where ever go (go) oh (oh)
Girl just come on let's keep it movin

[Verse 2:]
So we exchange numbers
I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six
We can go get a bite little lady,
Or chill at the mall and catch a flick
If that's alright (alright)
She said "As long I'm home by nine (nine)
Whatever we do is fine"

I can't believe (I can't believe that she's here with me, nooo)
And god oh me no (god oh me knows, how far we can go)
Then I hope this night will go my way (and we can do this everyday)
And if I'm cool and take my time,
I might just get a kiss goodnight

[Chorus:]
We can dip out alone (keep it movin)
Do something fun (& keep it movin)
Talk about life
About love
That's wats up
Keep it movin (ohh)
Don't matter at all (all) where ever go (go) oh (oh)
Girl just come on let's keep it movin
