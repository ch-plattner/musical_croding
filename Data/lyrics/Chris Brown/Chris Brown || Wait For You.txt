[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby
See I must admit girl
Cause all the crazy things that go through my head
Woahhh Oh oh No

[Hook 1:]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
(Girl you sexy from head to toe)
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard but

[Hook 2:]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me
Oh yeah
We can travel to space
As long as I got you right here next to me
I'm straight
Woahhhhhh, girl I'll wait
Ohhhhhhhh, for you, yes I will
Ohhhhhhhh, I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I just wanna love ya
Lord knows that I can't wait for the day
Na, Nahhhhh
I said I must admit girl
Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes
(To keep you here with me)

[Hook 1:]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time

You said you think we should wait a while
Girl it might be hard but

[Hook 2: Chris Brown & Se7en]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me
Oh yeah

Woahhhhhh, girl I'll wait
Ohhhhhhhh, for you, yes I will
Ohhhhhhhh, I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
It's been awhile and we both know that I've been patient girl
Cause you ain't been trying to give it up, nooooo

[Hook 2: Chris Brown & Se7en]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me
Oh yeah
We can travel this place
As long as I got you right here next to me
I'm straight
Woahhhhhh, girl I'll wait
Ohhhhhhhh, for you, yes I will
Ohhhhhhhh, I said I'll wait for you
