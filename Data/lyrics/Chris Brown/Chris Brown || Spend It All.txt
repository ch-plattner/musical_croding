I know you see all of this money in my hand

And if you keep doing it for me
Imma spend it all [x2]

Just got my check I'm bout to spend it on the whole club
Half of these niggas can't pay rent after it's ova
Two chicks me, hit bipolar
Jamaican-Indian chicks they totem pole up

The way you move ya body girl
Make me wanna feel ya body girl
Girl I know you want it, ain't no change for all these hundreds
I'm about to make it rain, they should change your name to stormy
Girl you know my dick's enormous
Girl I love your performance
She said she was from New Orleans
Tryna sting her like a hornet
Upgrade her, that's a bonus
Her booty that's what I'm bonin'

Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand

And if you keep doing it for me
Imma spend it all [x2]

It's alright, it's OK
Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face

And if you keep poppin' that booty
Imma spend it all [x2]

Let's go, my eyes shit cause her booty all in my face
I touch, no computer she in myspace

Damn look at mami lose it watch her girate
Breezy up in this bitch like a vibrator

V.I.P. with 2 of them
Got 2 cheeks use your booty for the A.T.M.
Credit cards, take off your bra have a menage
Particular, vehicular, call me the sarge

Grown booty from the A-Town
Pull her hair, can't see nothing from the waist down
For them dollars make her holler like "whoa"
And my transactions got them Jacksons, Michael

You corny rappers can't be serious
Cause deep down we know you pussy, period.
So now it's back to getting more hoes
You niggas lack delivery, Digiorno

Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand

And if you keep doing it for me
Imma spend it all [x2]

It's alright, it's OK
Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face

And if you keep poppin' that booty
Imma spend it all [x2]

I'm feeling myself, done had a couple drinks, I start to feeling myself
I start to dance up on ya feeling under your belt
I need a tipper, when I'm dancing you put the money on my thighs
Just watch me real low but Imma need a little more if Imma take it all off
Need you to dig in your pocket it's deeper
You say you a spender, then put your money where your mouth is

Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand

And if you keep doing it for me
Imma spend it all [x2]

It's alright, it's OK
Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face

And if you keep poppin' that booty
Imma spend it all [x2]
