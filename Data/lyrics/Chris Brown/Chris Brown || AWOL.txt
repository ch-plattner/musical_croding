
Why you're up in here starting drama?
Beauty got the bottie with a curve like ...
We can disappear into my ... until tomorrow
We can go ...
Think that I should .. hundred bills when you pass me
It was on my mind girl you don't even got to ask me
I don't need no bitches I ain't come to do no math
I just wanna get

[Chorus]
I got you baby girl
So you can relax
The way you do that
You know I'm on a mission
.. I'm trying to get love
You got a girlfriend you came with
.. where I'm going girl
We can go AWOL
Turn up the phone
Girl you don't need it
Nobody is coming ..
Gil we can go AWOL

I love the way you fit in Dolce and Gabanna
It makes me wanna get behind it
.. and just get love
I got the mister Money
I'm your super and your doctor
We can light it up and go .. like a rocket
Blow in the wind we don't need nobody watching
We can get AWOL

[Chorus]

We're about to .. now
Let it all .. now
Ain't no turning around now
Nobody's gonna know
Follow me ...
We can do it anywhere

[Chorus]

Baby I'm your ...
I can try get you to New Orleans
I ain't trying to beat it up
I'm trying just massage it
We can get AWOL
