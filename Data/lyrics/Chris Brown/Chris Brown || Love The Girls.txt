[Verse 1:]
What you lookin for baby, I know why you want love in the middle of the night
Don't be looking all scary
When you've been looking for this for long long time
Come on over here baby
You can love me in the dark, you can love me in the light
Your friends lookin' all crazy, 'cause you goin' home with me and they left behind
They can come to baby
What's yours is mines as long as they're fine,
All them girls I can't help it
Tell them one at a time and they all ask WHY?

[Chorus x4:]
Me love me, me love me, AYE!
Me love me, love me, love me, love me GIRLS
She lookin for them real ones.

[Verse 2:]
You can call me your daddy, I'll be your lover or whatever you like
Girl, let me look at it,
Don't you make me have to ask twice
'Cause I'm up in your city, and I'm only in town for one more night
You ain't the only one here baby, so many girls in line going crazy outside
LET'S GO!!

[Chorus x4:]
Me love me, me love me, AYE!
Me love me, love me, love me, love me GIRLS
She lookin for them real ones.

[Game:]
Take the roof off the asten, pull the top off the bellview
And we can do whatever you tell me, you smell me?
John V. Cologne on yachts out in Colombo
When I'm home I'm Rambo, Sylvester Stallone
And she know that, picture us like Kodak
Red vines, red wine, listenin to Bobby Womack
And its a throwback
Me and CB, tell'em to hold that
And if you see a couple dimes show'em where the boat at!

[Chorus x4:]
Me love me, me love me, AYE!
Me love me, love me, love me, love me GIRLS
She lookin for them real ones.

HEY!
OH!
AAH!
Me love me girls..
Yeah you love me girl..
I said you love me girl..
And I love you girl..
YEAH!!
