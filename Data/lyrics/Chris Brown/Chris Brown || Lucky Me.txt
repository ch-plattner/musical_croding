[Verse 1]
Lights on, stage set.
I guess I gotta put on a show in
'cause everyone's waiting
Females, fly jets
When I turn the radio on
I hear all my songs playing (yeah)
Whatever money can buy
I've probably got it (that's real talk, yeah)
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit hear saying
Lucky me.

[Chorus]
I've got to pose of the cameras
Even when my world's falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
I've got to pick my self
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else (yeah)
Lucky me.

[Verse 2]
So exclusive
I don't have to wait in a line
It's like the club is mine now
If it was only that simple
Everyone says it easy to do
Well we know, that's not true
Whatever money can buy
I've probably got it (that's real talk, yeah)
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit hear saying
Lucky me.

[Chorus]
I've got to pose of the cameras
Even when my world's falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
I've got to pick my self
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else (yeah)
Lucky me.

[Verse 3]
My dream and it's my heart
The life of being a star
You don't even know how hard it is, do you (yeah)
Now I'm thankfully for everything
And I'm finally becoming a man
Now I gotta pick a show to do
Lucky me.

[Chorus]
I've got to pose of the cameras
Even when my worlds falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
I've got to pick my self
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard?
I wouldn't put this on no one else.
