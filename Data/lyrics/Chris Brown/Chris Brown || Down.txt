[Chorus:]
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down

[Kanye West]
Uh... Mr. West is in the building
Children, ladies
Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy
Hold your drinks up, like you was celebrating
Hold your guns, if they is hella hating
I'm so clean, and them they got rabies
I can see them through the lens of my ray b ans wayfarers... hm
Yeah do you play fair? Mmm
Grab your remote, for the reason they made TIVO
Snap your Nikon's with the icons with Nike's on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mics on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment
You have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Oops, I ain't mean to say that shit
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A List
Not one that's just barely made it on A List
Cause from Wall To Wall
We got it Poppin' right now
It's a hundred girls, tryna get DOWN DOWN DOWN

[Chris Brown]
Baby girl, gotta tell you
Seen you somewhere before, you look familiar
You had a red shirt, Gucci Slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that baby girl, but lady never mind that
Can I take you out later? And here's my contact
Can you do me this favor? Let me spend this paper?
on you 'cause it's just sitting and let's just get it and go

Let me [x2]
Guarantee [x2]
I'll make your day, OK!!!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Chris Brown]
The way I see it girl, you a perfect ten
That's why I'm all on you baby
You got me wondering
What to do, what to say
Don't want to come off lame
Girl do you gotta man?
Better yet girl, what's your name?
Just let me [x2]
Guarantee [x2]
I'll make your day, OK!!!
Now if you wit it shawty [x3]
Let me [x2]
Take you better way
Baby can we dream, just for today?

[x2]
I wanna get down [x4]
(Girl that'd be crazy)
Down, Down, Down (got to get down)
Get Down (oh)
We can get down
OH BABY!!!!!!

Grab your remote, for the reason they made TIVO
Snap your Nikon's with the icons with Nike's on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mics on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment
You have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Oops, I ain't mean to say that shit
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A List
Not one that's just barely made it on A List
Cause from Wall To Wall
We got it Poppin' right now
It's a hundred girls, tryna get DOWN DOWN DOWN

[Chorus x2]

OH BABY!!!!!!
