Oh oh-ohhhh
You said I’m not giving enough
But baby girl I’m trying so hard to
Keep up, when you fear
That I’ma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open..
Darling you know it will get better
But you know that shit won’t happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl I’ll be there

When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up
Don’t wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles
Just for one minute to see you smile

I’m treading water
I’m treading water
Please don’t cry cause your drowning me

Oh oh-ohhhh
Oh oh-ohhhh
What do you say?
What do you mean?
That you blame me
Why is it today that you doubted me
That I’ma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open
Darling you know it will get better
But you know that shit won’t happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl I’ll be there

When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up
Don’t wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles
Just for one minute to see you smile

I’m treading water
I’m treading water
Please don’t cry cause your drowning me

Oh oh-ohhhh
Oh oh-ohhhh
