Shawty fine, walkin by, make a nigga look
See the way she toot it up, got a nigga stuck
Zooted and booted up, shuttin down the club
Look at shawty's hip, once she winds it up
Now rewind that back, put it in reverse baby I like that
Can't nobody do it better, let chu do your thing while I sip this amaretto

I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl pon da ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl jus keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up
Come look at yo-you work aye young girl with the tied up skirt
The way you move ya body make me wana hit it
I know you classy but you still can act a hoe wit it
It ain't no question bout it, shawty you can get it
The only question is, can you work wit it?
Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it?
Can you twirk with it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Ahha

Throw it back at me, Ima head of home run
Swingin my bat like my name A. Rod
Ima have you screamin out Oh My God
When I find yo spot, yeah
And Ima have you runnin from this D
Like a crook runnin from the police
But Im gon getcha, goin downtown let me read your miranda

I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl pon da ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl jus keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up
Come look at yo-you work aye young girl with the tied up skirt
The way you move ya body make me wana hit it
I know you classy but you still can act a hoe wit it
It ain't no question bout it, shawty you can get it
The only question is, can you work wit it?
Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it?
Can you twirk with it? Can you work wit it? Can you work wit it? Ahha

I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl pon da ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl jus keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up
Come look at yo-you work aye young girl with the tied up skirt
