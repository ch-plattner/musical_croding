Haha what’s up ladies 
How ya’ll doin’ 
Yea I know what ya’ll need 
All of ya’ll 
And that’s ya’ll gangsta boo right 
Come on 
Mmm 
Yea…Yea 
Oh no no 

It was 6 o’clock on the dot 
That’s when I seen this cutie 
She was chillin' at the spot 
she was wit her girls 
I was wit my boys 
All of a sudden 
I asked her to come over and say 
“Wot up ma 
How’d you like to get to know me? 
I’m not shy 
I’ll do anything for you and 
I’m that guy 
Say I pick you up at eight 
I promise I won’t be late” 

[Girl] ‘Cause all I ever wanted was 
Someone I could hold on to 
Someone who would never break my heart in two 
[Chris] can I be the one for you? 
[Girl] lets sing out and let’s see 

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that I’d call her (it’s true) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (it’s true) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on, come on 

I never met no-one like you before 
But I gotta take this chance 
Cause if I don’t I’ll never know 
What this girl is really looking for 
I may not have all the money (so who cares) 
I may not have all the fancy cars (I’d still be there) 
But what I have to give you baby 
Is so much more 

[Girl] ‘Cause all I ever wanted was 
Someone I could hold on to 
Someone who would never break my heart in two 
[Chris] can I be the one for you? 
[Girl] lets sing out and let’s see 

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that I’d call her (it’s true) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (it’s true) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on, come on 

Hey shorty you’re the one 
Nice lips thick hips 
Put me on 
Too tough come on girl 
Break me off 
I can’t see you wit nobody else 
Nobody’s like your Chris (noo) 

Come on baby [x2]

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that I’d call her (it’s true – yes I did) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (it’s true) 
I’m not looking for the love but 
I think that you’re the one 
So come on, come on 

ooohh ohh
