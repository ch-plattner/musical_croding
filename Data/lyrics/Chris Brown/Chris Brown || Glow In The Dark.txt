[Verse 1:]
Been thinkin' bout this all damn day (oh whoa)
And I can't wait to see your face (mmm ohh)
My hands are dyin to touch ya (oh whoa)
But I ain't got the patience to wait

[Bridge:]
And I think its time
That I...
Lose control...Lose control
And in my mind
I'm sexual...sexual

[Chorus:]
Girl are you ready?
Are you ready for love?
Girl are you ready?
Are you ready for us?
Girl are you ready?
Are you ready for love?
Girl are you ready?
To glow in the dark

[Verse 2:]
Its okay to scream
And if you need to take a second to breathe (sss ahh)
Hey, there it is
I can feel your legs trembling
You feel the sweat drippin from my chest
And you'll be like "Ohh Ohh Ohh baby don't stop"
Then I'll be like "No I won't imma take ya to the top"

[Chorus]

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
