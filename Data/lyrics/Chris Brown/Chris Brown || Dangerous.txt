
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous (let's go)
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious

(Dangerous)

Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

You (dangerous)
You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

Don't know what you're thinking sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling sugar, ooh
And I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning, I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Dangerous
Oh oh oh-oh-oh (dangerous)

Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the grass, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

I don't know what you're thinking sugar (oh yeah)
And I just got that feeling sugar (oh yeah)
I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Dangerous
Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Dangerous

Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah baby
Never scared baby
Runnin' all the red lights, living on the edge baby
Just a little crazy, maybe we are
Doing 'bout a hundred and she want it in the car
(Uh huh) And I don't know what you did
(Uh huh) Don't know what it is
(Uh huh) Can't explain enough
It's dangerous

It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Dangerous
Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Dangerous

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious, oh

Dangerous
