He plays the sweetest melody. 
When I hear, it takes over me. 
And I feel every strum of the strings. 
It reminds me of all the things we used to be. 
Can't breathe at all cause you're coming. 

Coming through my speaker, speaker  
got me trying to reach ya, reach ya. 
My analogue feature, feature, 
my electric guitar. 
Everytime I mind you, mind you  
everytime I'm by him, by him. 
You're ripping it up on them chords, 
playing my heart. 
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar. 
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar. 

It kills me that I can't be with you, 
thought I was the key you're playing. 
Don't know I just gotta, be the one you let bleed out. 
Wish I didn't know you, got me feeling stuck. 
I can't let you go, just my luck. 
Falling down without you, 
can you pick me up?
And now I cant get you off my head. 
because youre comming. 

Coming through my speaker, speaker  
got me trying to reach ya, reach ya.

You're ripping it up on them chords, 
playing my heart. 
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar. 
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar. 

I'm losing my composure, all quit, game over. 
You must think that I'm crazy, girl. 
Please control me with your melody. 
I'll play it for the world, 
cause I'm your girl and I just wanna hear (So)
