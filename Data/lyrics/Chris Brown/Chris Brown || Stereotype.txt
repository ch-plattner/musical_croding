I think I know why, I've been holding on
To the words from your every lie
Fool me once, shame on you, baby
Fool me twice, should have know that there would be problems girl
With you
But I thought

[Pre-Hook:]
You were different my baby
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different my baby
You've become my biggest regret

[Hook:]
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stere-ere-ere-o

Can't blame you
You were only being yourself
I fell in love with someone that I barely knew, why?
Fool me once, shame on you, baby
Fool me twice, should have know that there would be problems girl
With you
But I thought
