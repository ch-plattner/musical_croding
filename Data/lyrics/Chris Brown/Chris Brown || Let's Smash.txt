Its ya boy breezy hit em' wit that auto-tune
Automatic, sistimatic, robo to cuz I want to
Ima kindah guy dont follow rules
So c'mon baby girl lets break a few
But let me say this

Hold on, are you sure you wanna play with fire
Im gurenteed to take it higher,
If you say you dont then your a liar, yeeaaa
You dont want my numba baby, you dont want m math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You dont want no picture baby or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want

You wanna hit it, hit it, hit it smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it smash

I know ha game, she all the same
I dont really really wanna know ha name
She went downtown like a stalka shame,
But all ha friends kept cock-blockin mayne

Hit it, hit it, hit it smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it smash
