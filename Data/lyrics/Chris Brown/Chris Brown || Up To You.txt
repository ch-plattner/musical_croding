[Verse 1]
What the hell babe,
Damn I ain't never felt this way
Somebody, somebody, tell me
I don't have a clue what to do
When it comes to you
Baby, you're so beautiful
Every time I see you girl, it throw me off
It's so unusual
For me to be waiting
But I don't want to blow it girl,
But you should know this girl

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before, 
I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl
We can take our time and 
you can run this, Stay in, go out,
Anything you want girl, we can do
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,
I'ma leave it up to you

[Verse 2]
What the hell babe
make me wanna jump out an airplane
The way it feels, I just can't explain
I don't wanna lose it, so I'm just gone stay out my own way
Baby, you're so incredible (you're so beautiful), 
every time I see you girl, it throw me off
It's some kind of special (unusual)
So I'm gone keep waiting
But I don't wanna blow it girl,
But you should know this girl...

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before, 
I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl
We can take our time and 
you can run this, Stay in, go out,
Anything you want girl, we can do
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,

[Breakdown]
I'm not tryna be a heart breaker, like I was before
(that was the old me)
I've made so many tears, I don't wanna make no, make no more
so give me your list, yes I'm checking things off
ready to go to work, baby you can be boss
and I'm okay with it, ain't gone play with it
so baby girl, it's your call

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before, 
I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl
We can take our time and 
you can run this, Stay in, go out,
Anything you want girl, we can do
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,
leave that up to you
