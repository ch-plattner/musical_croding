[Hook - Chris Brown:]
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
And all the hoes in the party hit the dance floor

[Chris Brown:]
Pull up, nigga creeping
Colder than a motherfucker
Guess it's ho season (bitch)
Shorty got that ass, baby girl it's nice to meet you
With these lights off, give a fuck about your features
I'm tryna fuck
If it's one on one gimme that eye soap
But if it's two of ya'll I'ma let the dice roll
It's the weekend, I could tell you been freaking
Cause you popping Miley Cyrus and you twerking with your eyes closed
Go figure, skinny nigga with a suit on
Bunch of bad bitches
Yeah, they like me nigga, who don't?
Drop top, everything
We party like the roof gone
A nigga got a problem, blaka-blaka, then we move on (blap)
Tell 'em hold that
If you looking for liquor, better lick up
My liquor zing and you know that
Bitches looking for a sponsorship, cha-ching, cause I sponsor shit
Bitch I throw racks
Fucked up, got me dancing on the floor
Tryna dance in that pussy, tell me when to go
I'm tore up, feeling like I'm 'bout to throw up
One night with me this bitch about to blow up

[Hook x2]

[Tyga:]
Ain't shit but model bitches over here
I'm a nigga with money bitch
Let's make that clear
You here with a Elf ear
Hoes in stock over here
And the price going up by the year
It's a good year, baby
On my blimp shit
You too defensive and sensitive
That's on some mental shit
No sense in lingering
Can't count on you niggas man, only count Benjamins
He my closest friend
My wrist a wrist
Ice the bitch
Like it's sprained and shit
I'm the nigga, nigga
Yes he is, the flyest with three yes' [?]
I take that pussy and ransom it
When I hit the block, better have your banger
[?]
She fold it close, we ain't gon' ever hang
[?]
Bang-bang

[Hook x2]

[Chris Brown:]
She was bomb but she wanted me to pay for it
Alley-oop bitch, you know a nigga play whores
I play with pussy, girl you know that I'm a playboy
Clap, clap, clap then she make that booty make noise
She make that ass wobble like a monster
Twerk something, hurt something
Damn, I'ma need a doctor
A bitch with some real hair straight up out the projects
And she turn her phone off from all them niggas she be dodging
[?] head
She don't give a fuck about nothing but her bread
But when I dance in that pussy do the running man
While all these other niggas fucking with [?]
I'm throwing all of this money and I'm advancing these strippers
I got my hand on the pussy she got her hand on my zipper
She started going to work my shit got hard as a missile
Then she say she got a twin, I started fucking her sister
