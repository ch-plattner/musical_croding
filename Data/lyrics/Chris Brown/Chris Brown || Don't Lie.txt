[Verse 1]
Ok you know the name, so you know the drill,
Ain't singing candy rain, but I'm so fo real,
You know like my love do you ever dream of candy coated rain drops pouring down high loves,
And I'm all about my gualas,
Even though they say more money more problems,
But I don't picture me going on no job hunt,
Money pilin up now thats somethin to be proud of,
Yea I'm killin 'em, but it's not my fault,
Cos I've been on my grind, ha Tony Hawk,
And them rims are 28's, martial fuck,
My lyrics murderin niggas I need to write a chalk,

[Verse 2]
I'm on patrone and hypnotic, this Gucci on my body,
And im big big drippin and dippin Kowusaki, 
Got more kicks than karate, than your son Mr.Muyagi,
I'm hotter than Wusabi, Bet bet better yet Mohavi,
I'm all about my money so my cash never fo,
They be like why you shittin on 'em? Cos Imma asshole,
Everywhere I go I be followed by six hoes,
And my checks got a one comma followed by six 0's,
Women lie, men lie,
Go ahead touch it, 
Money talkin if you ain't talkin big bucks hush it, up,
Duck, cos I'm blowin up,
Pockets off that muscle milk, boy that swole as fuck
