[Verse 1]
If I could, take a trip, to outer space
She would be the one, I will see
When I get, to heavens gate
She would welcome me with her arms, open wide, and a smile
Will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasn’t had a fair chance, so I’ll give her one
Let me tell you who she is, yeah

[Chorus]
She’s a fallen angel, sent from heaven up above
She’s a fallen angel, waitin for me to love her, yeah
(Know that she’s)  She’s a fallen angel, take your judgment off her
I know, that she’s a fallen angel

[Verse 2]
You know, I could
Help her mend, her broken wings
So she can fly again
But I don’t,  wanna lose everything that I’ve gained
Turnin me a selfish man (oh)
Cause without em my heart just don’t go, no more (no more)
I couldn’t take the pain, from watchin her fly away
So say that you’ll stay
She’s mine

[Chorus]
She’s a fallen angel, (ooh) sent from heaven up above
She’s a fallen angel, waitin for me to love her, yeah
(Know that she’s)  She’s a fallen angel, so take your judgment off her
I know, that she’s a fallen angel

[Verse 3]
Don’t you
Baby don’t you (don’t you worry) worry
I’m gon help you (I’m gon help you ) fly 
(I’m gon help you fly)
Just take me under yo (take me under) wings,
And we can reach the (we can reach the) sky 
(we can reach the sky)
Baby don’t you (don‘t you worry) worry, 
I’m gon help you (I’m gon help you ) fly 
(I’m gon help you fly)
Yo mama, don’t you (take me under) worry
you gon reach the (we can reach the) sky 
(we can reach the sky)
She’s a…

[Chorus]
She’s a fallen angel, (hey hey) sent from heaven up above, just for me
She’s a fallen angel, waitin for me to wrap my heart around her, know 
(Know that  she’s)  She’s a fallen angel, makin due with all the judgment (no)
I know, that she’s (yeah) a fallen angel (ooh ahh)

[Verse 4]
Baby I know
I know that they done hurt you
But I’m here
Let’s take it all away
So if you let me…
You know what, just put your heart in my hands
And everything they say, I take it back
Like this…
