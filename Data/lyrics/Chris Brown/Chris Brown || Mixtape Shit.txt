[Intro]
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh

[Verse]
Higher than the moon, nigga what up
Yeah I hear em woofing, yo nigga need shut up
While I'm in the pussy, face down and the butt up
You ain't shit to her, but me I'm just a fucked up
Fuck a handshake nigga we ain't brothers
From that westsidee, where they repping for their colors
Talking big shit, cause my dick will make you shut up
All over your face like it's butter, nut up
Right now, make her scream my name and pipe her way down
That's the only reason bitch, give a nigga a wipe down
24 inches I'm on the road, my niggas smoking on that loud
Bitches tryna front, I'm blow they back out
I ain't thinking bout it, nigga walking past you
Bitch smell my blunt and says she like my tattoo's
I'm that dude, I slang wood, that bamboo
But when she drop it on the dick she a damn fool

[Chorus]
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
Really really though, all these bitches
I on want no niggas
Cause the real niggas posted up already with us

[Verse 2]
It's a habit in the club I'd imagine
Fucking with these ratchets, no purses
They got baskets it's a handout
Bitching high feening, guess they addicts
And I ask them [?]
Are you in like Patrick
Playing with the pussy like its madden
Fly like a dragon
If one says she likes me then they all bandwagon
She's a leading ass ho but they pretty like a pageant
She said she let me cut, I got to stabbing
For real though

[Chorus]
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
Really really though, all these bitches
I on want no niggas
Cause the real niggas posted up already with us

[Verse 3]
Ice cold so a nigga still chilling
She ain't popped a pill, so I'ma eat her with my grill in
Damn let me dig in, I call it a fillin
Poking on that pussy I am not a syringe
I got the fliest of friends
We ain't thinking bout no air miles
Niggas setting trends just look at there hair styles
Yeah, I fuck once then I fuck twice
Fuck that... I be fucking that bitch every night
Snow bunnies cause I like my bitches very white
Go and catch a flight, get this pipe into paradise huhh
Who said something bout paradise?
Girl drop that ass, [?]
Like Barry White
Gotta stop staring at my yeezy's
I gotta em for the [?]
I said I'm cool, no I'm breezy
Twenty five hundred dollar tip
Leave that bitch cheesy
I gave that to shit to you for a reason, believe me

[Chorus]
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
I on need no niggas in my section
All bitches all bitches all bitches all bitches uhh
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
All these bitches ion wanna see no niggas,
Really really though, all these bitches
I on want no niggas
Cause the real niggas posted up already with us
