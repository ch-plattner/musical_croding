Stop, where am I?
Shock, I can't cry
Pop, I need some space
No, this isn't me
Oh, please let me breathe
I'll be back sooner than you know

I need this space just like you need it
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that? Shh... Hear my heart beat? Shh...
I need this relief, whoa yeah, I really need this

Whoa, I've been blind
I hope I'll be fine
Don't call me back, no
Yes, I see light
Now, it's so bright
Call my name, I'll be there soon

I need this space just like you need it
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that? Shh... Hear my heart beat? Shh...
I need this relief
Wait, did you hear that? Shh... Hear my heart beat? Shh...
I need this relief, whoa yeah, I really need this
I need this [x2]
I really need this

You know it's not personal
Sorry if I'm hurting you
Please don't give up on me now
I needed this time alone
To know I could come back home
To breathe, breathe, breathe

I need this space just like you need it
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that? Shh... Hear my heart beat? Shh...
I need this relief, whoa yeah
Wait, did you hear that? Shh... Hear my heart beat? Shh...
I need this relief, whoa yeah

I really need this
Whoa
I need this [x2]
Whoa [x2]
Yeah
Ohh
I really need
Whoaa [x2]
hey [x2]
I need...
I really really need
I need, I need this
I need this
I really need this [x3]
