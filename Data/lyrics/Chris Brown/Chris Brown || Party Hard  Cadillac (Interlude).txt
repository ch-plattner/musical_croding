[Verse 1:]
I just need one more dance
And girl I hate this feeling
But it's not going away
I think I'm in love with you
And I can't help myself
Cause this may be the only chance I got with you
And I know you gon show out

She likes all them stripper poles
Like taking off her clothes
And when you work that girl you stop my heart

[Chorus:]
Shes got the perfect lips, the perfect body
Shes the life of the party (yeah)
And she likes to party hard
She's such a rock and roller
But she's exotic
She's the life of my party
She likes to party hard
You're spilling your drinks on me
Livin' wild and free
Tonight
Girl change my life
I hope you put your lips on me
My mind's playing tricks on me
Tonight
We gon party hard

[Verse 2:]
I see straight through your eyes
And girl you might as well just say what you're already thinking
([Se7en:] cause we on the same page)
Take me to ecstasy and far beyond
Show me how you have your fun baby
And girl we got all night

She likes all them stripper poles
Like taking off her clothes
And when you work that girl you stop my heart

[Chorus:]
She's got the perfect lips, the perfect body
She's the life of the party (yeah)
And she likes to party hard
She's such a rock and roller
But she's exotic
She's the life of my party
She likes to party hard
You're spilling your drinks on me
Living wild and free
Tonight
Girl change my life
I hope you put your lips on me
My mind's playing tricks on me
Tonight

And when we touch,

[Chorus:]
She's got the perfect lips, the perfect body
She's the life of the party (yeah)
And she likes to party hard
She's such a rock and roller
But she's exotic
She's the life of my party
She likes to party hard
You're spilling your drinks on me
Livin' wild and free

My mind's playing tricks on me

In my Cadillac
Moving very fast
Got a girl
With a big old ass
And we go ho hunter
Gonna have a good time
Anything she want

Cause my girl

And I want her for the rest of my life
I love to hear her say
That she loves me
I love it when she tells me that she needs me
When she looks in my eyes

It don't take a lot
All I need is you
To be the man for me
But I want it all
And I'm willing
To give you what I need

Ain't scared to show you the freaky side of me
Sometimes I fight you off
But I love it rough
When you make love to me

And I love it
When he tells me that he needs me
When he looks in my eyes
Ooh ooh
