
Look at us, never thought it would be you
Who found new, girl we may never know
It's enough knowing that I won't lose my way
But getting here wasn't easy

We bend, don't break that's the story of us
No give or take, didn't get me nowhere
I've learned from the hurt along the way
And it brought me right to you babe

[Hook:]
I'm taking every road under the sun
Every dead-end love brought another one
I should be fuming at all the time we wasted
But a million wrongs lead me right to, right to you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Feels right here, so right here with you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Feels right here, so right here with you

We've got scars, some of them you gave me, some of them I caused
That doesn't matter now
We both know the worst part is over
Ain't no letting go (letting go)

We bend, don't break that's the story of us
No give or take, didn't get me nowhere
I've learned from the hurt along the way
And it brought me right to you babe

[Hook]

Hearts are like cars just racing on broken pavement
Going nowhere fast, still we stay on the gas
Love don't ride easy and it ain't always pretty
Yeah I know cause I've taken every road

[Hook]
