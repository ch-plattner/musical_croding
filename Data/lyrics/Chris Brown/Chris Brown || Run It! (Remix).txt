So scream at a nigga when your ready to ride

[Chris Brown]
Let me talk to you
Tell you how it is

Tell her what the young boy gon do
Damn them chicks wit chu gotta be your kin
Babe pretty thick wit the kick that's sick that need to be hit
So tell me what ya'll gon do

They hop out, and you hop in

The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop [2x]

The girls come to us so we dont chase
She move her booty like a lowrider.... up... down
