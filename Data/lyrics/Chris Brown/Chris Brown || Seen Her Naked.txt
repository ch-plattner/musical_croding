
She's so pretty
But she walks so mean
The hottest little number
That I've ever seen
And if you seen a dime
shes that times three
She's a bad girl, just what I need
She's got a swagger
sharp like a dagger
Cupid done shot me
I'll go to heaven
I got a secret that she don't know
I already done seen her goods before

[Chorus:]
I've been trying to get her off my mind
fast forward but it rewinds
Cause I've been seen her naked
To make it every time I turn around
I'm seeing her clothes come down
Cause I have seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes
I can't forget
Cause I've been seeing her naked

I'm not the dog
I'm just a dog
Cause I've been seeing
I've been seeing

She took it off for me
She took it already
I've been seeing
I've been seeing her naked
[repeats]

Ooh wee she gotta body
And you cant, you cant do nothing bout it
You look at here up and down
Trying to figure out
Are you gonna see what I saw?
Don't even act like you're surprised
She has it mesmerized of the guys
She got to move it
Now you see her body everywhere
you go see, you go see what I'm talking about

[Chorus]

She took it off for me
She took it already
I've been seeing
I've been seeing her naked
[repeats]

All the ladies report to the dance floor
I wanna see you something you never did before
Shake it to the East
Shake it to the West
Show them how to make it
You're gonna shake it

[Chorus]
