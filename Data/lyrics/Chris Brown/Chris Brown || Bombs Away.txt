
If I want, me ready for,
If I want, me ready for

I’m a carnivore, natural born killer so I gotta be
On any damn thing in front of me
In the club, cause I’m gonna eat tonight
I’m a gorilla, like drums on my chest so I gotta beat
When I start to do you know what it means
You can’t leave, not until you battle me
I know you’re out there, somewhere
I feel you and I smell your fear
Bust a few shots in the air, come on, come on
Your body is bout to go up
I want you to show off
You pacify time seek [?]
You have been, so it’s time to act
On the world, coming for you now
If I want, me ready for,
If I want, me ready for

[Chorus]
Bombs away, bombs away
I'm coming for you now
So you better take cover
Cause I need it and I want ya
You partying on me cause I’m ready for ya
Girl I like that
Yeah you coming ready but I need a little more
Cause I’m falling right back
If I want, me ready for

[Verse]
It’s getting hot and heavy
She looking like she want me
To cut her like a machete
And I’ma give it to her
But that’s only if you let me
I’ma let her catch it, but it’s only the beginning, yeah
She ain’t into nasty but I ain’t mad at all
But she b-b-b-bad and she running from the law
Battle when she dancing on me that’s how I can tell
She a gi jane in the bed for real
I know you’re up there somewhere
I feel you and I smell your fear
Bust a few shots in the air, come on, come on
Your body is bout to go up
I want you to show off
You pacify time seek [?]
You have been, so it’s time to act
On the world, coming for you now
If I want, me ready for,
If I want, me ready for

[Chorus]
Bombs away, bombs away
I'm coming for you now
So you better take cover
Cause I need it and I want ya
You partying on me cause I’m ready for ya
Girl I like that
Yeah you coming ready but I need a little more
Cause I’m falling right back
If I want, me ready for

[Verse]
It’s like I travel to another dimension
Cause Shawty got my soldiers standing at attention
I’m like yeah it’s the battle of the sexes
I wrap her legs round my head like a necklace
It’s like it’s bombs over Baghdad
And Shawty ass fat so I’ma bag that
M-m-mercy, is what you begging for
I’m standing on the bar screaming
If I want, me ready for,
If I want, me ready for
So hold your glasses up if you need more
Whole lot of women but I need more
I got the long sword, like the marine corp
Let me take a stab at it leave your spleen soar
I think I’m King Kong, Godzilla
Go a couple rounds, girl that in Manilla
Now show me who iller
And I’ll show you a mirror
You want that fire, I deliver

[Chorus]
Bombs away, bombs away
I'm coming for you now
So you better take cover
Cause I need it and I want ya
You partying on me cause I’m ready for ya
Girl I like that
Yeah you coming ready but I need a little more
Cause I’m falling right back
If I want, me ready for
If I want, me ready for
If I want, me ready for,
If I want, me ready for.
