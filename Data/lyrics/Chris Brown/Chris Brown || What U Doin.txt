Drama, what U doin?
Nigger why you mad? 
You know we're bullshitting 
I like my cars so I like my broad's top missing
Made from the liquor and faces full of DNA
And me and Sean came to party 
So it's TNA
I go to war for that money
I'm a green beret
I got that cash flow

What U doin, boy? 

Nigger why you mad? You know we're bullshitting 
I like my cars so I like my broad's top missing
Made from the liquor and faces full of DNA
And me and Sean came to party 
So it's TNA
I go to war for that money, 
I'm a green beret
I got that cash flow nigger 

Nigga I just need to save
Call me birdman
Flock full of chickens
What u doin
I'm bullshitting
You get paid
No never mind
Cause by the time you see me
Been seeing your girl like hella times
And she might say your name
But she yelling mine
You a sucker
You a lame
I'm a veteran
I do my thing
Dirty dirty
I'm a be the reason why they acting flirty
1:30 kinda early
They callin' me ... cause I'm getting birdies
And I'm a birdman
Whole flock of chickens
Nigga what U doin
Bullshitting

Nigga hold up
The track done blowed up
My flow sick as shit
I think I throwed up
What up my nigga Sean
We rocking all these ladies
And we responsible for after? all these babies
You know it's G.O.O.D. music
CBE I do do it
Poo poo on that track
And I be shitting on them vomit fluid
Call a coroner
Nigga good riddance
What U doin boy?
