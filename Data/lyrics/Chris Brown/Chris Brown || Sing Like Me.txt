Soon as I step out the whip that spot me 
Girls snappin pictures like the paparazzi 
So many different type of women I'm into 
And I can take them all with me and my only issue 

I wanna leave out of here and take em back to the crib 
And show how I do the cho-cha 
Hit em like so-sa 
I wanna leave out of here and take em back to the crib 
Cause you know what I thinking they look better naked 
There so many ladies 
Up in this club that I can choose from 
And they all look amazing 
That's why its so hard to just pick one 

When I get them off in the room 
We ain't playing by no rules 
Got em singing melodies 
And it sounds like ya favorite song playing on the radio 
Cant get enough of me 
Gotta girl singing like me 
Gotta girl singing like me 
Gotta girl singing like me 
Gotta girl singing like me 

All these bottles poppin got me feeling nicely 
Leaving by myself feels highly unlikely 
Lookin for a right now don't need no wifey 
Settling down one chick that aint even like me 

So many women in the atmosphere 
Gotta leave with at least three in a pair 
The look in they eyes tellin me that they want it 
But I don't like them that much to put a ring on it
