What Do i Do.. Stop, Go, Fail, Succed? Live or Die? I Just Got To Believe 

Believe its worth saving 
And to get lost, lost in a day dream 
So why hesitate 
Take me to another place 
So far far away 
So i can get out of the dark 
High speed, like I'm racing 
It's like lighting, sky is blazing 
But you've lost your way, You've been lead astray 
Are there better days for my fallen dreamer 

Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x])
Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x]) 
(You don't sleep no more) You don't even sleep no more 
(Dream no more) You don't even dream no more 
Dreamer (Dreamer) 
Why don't you just dream again  

Believe in you 
You got something to prove 
Your a star 
Watch you shine bright on your way to the limelight 
Finish line 
The sweat and tears 
You can channel all of your fears 
Open your eyes 
Your eyes
And it will be alright 

Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x])
Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x]) 
(You don't sleep no more) You don't even sleep no more 
(Dream no more) You don't even dream no more 
Dreamer (Dreamer) 
Why don't you just dream again  

(A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [8x]) 

Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x])
Calling a Dreamer (A Dreamer A A A Dreamer [2x]) 
(You don't sleep no more) You don't even sleep no more 
(Dream no more) You don't even dream no more 
Dreamer (Dreamer) 
Why don't you just dream again
