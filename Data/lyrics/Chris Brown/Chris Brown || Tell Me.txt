
Yeah, Yeah
New Smitty!

Let me know
If I push this maybach baby
Do you wanna go?
And (Big D we done did it again)
If so (we done did it again)
Should I roll this thing out
Or let it go
Tell me

[Verse 1:]
To all my ladies and gents
In the club spending money for rent
Holla at me 'cause we at it again
Making a killing
Better tell 'em who you with
Money over bitches stick to the script
Drinks that we sip
So they feed us more litres of cris
Out the bottle swallow never sip
And this is good as it gets
We on some down south playa shit
It's a trip
And I'm a get fresh for all my women
AF1's with the strap white linen
? in the back with my dollar stacked up to the ceiling
You will see when they show me on "How I'm Living"
And I'm a take this time to point out
All my mami's and Gucci and the money
And we can chill on some cool shit (yeah)
More money than we know what to do with (for real)

[Chorus:]
Tell me
If you feeling it right
If you still play (put your hands way up in the sky)
With someone like me (let 'em know you's a playa tonight)
Tell Me
If you feeling it right
If you still play (all my ladies put 'em up in the sky)
(let 'em know what's the deal)
This is for the playa in you
(true playa for real)

[Verse 2:]
Who you kissin? Who you wanna be huggin?
Made something from nothing
Out this life of crime
Money is time
So I spend mine hustlin rhymes
With another foot stuck in the grind
Now lemme ask you this
Have you ever been on private jets
With a private chef
First class eatin lobster tails
All types of exotic fish
Straight shit
(don't know you're name)
But excuse me miss
Lemme offer you some wine
Pass strike the 9 (just take this)
Light a cigar
Fill my cup with the best liquor
Real life is what we are
I ain't ashamed of this
It's all fame
The money just came with this
True game I spit to the lamest chick
See my clique so big...

[Chorus:]
Tell me
If you feeling it right
If you still play (put your hands way up in the sky)
With someone like me (let 'em know you's a playa tonight)
Tell Me
If you feeling it right
If you still play (all my ladies put 'em up in the sky)
(let 'em know what's the deal)
This is for the playa in you
(true playa for real)

[Bridge:]
Come with me
To the afterparty
