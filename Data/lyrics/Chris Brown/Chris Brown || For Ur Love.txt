[Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Till you come home
Here all alone
I stay alone for your love
For your love [x6]

[Verse]
Put my pimp cup down
Nothing lost nothing found
Its the things that you do
That makes me love you
Turn around and thump thump
Thats what i want you to do
even when i want you
I hope you want me too.

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Till you come home
Here all alone
I stay alone for your love
For your love [x6]

[Verse]
I know what Imma do now
Imma keep you around
I like your teeth when you smile
And your bootie is like wow
So turn around and thump thump
All that junk in your trunk
I really really want you
I hope you want me too.

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you (yeeeaaa)
Till you come home (yeaaa yeaaa)
Here all alone (im here im here im here)
I stay alone for your love (for your love)
For your love (yeaaa) [x6]
