
Told that I'm supposed to fail, 
I wouldn't amount to much of nothin'. 
Yes I pray, there was days, 
I wondered if you really loved me. 
"But baby you feel pain." 
Mama would say when I felt like runnin' away. 
I couldn't take it. 
I Soon hit ten, angry with all of the world. 
I couldn't keep friends, just wishin' you'd come back and see, 
My difficult times being an adolescent. 
And like so many just like me, without a shoulder to lean. 

I needed you 
When I needed a father figure. 
I needed you 
To stop me from makin' a wrong decision. 
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall. 

I need, I needed you. 
I need, I needed you.

Mama had no financial help 
And thoughts of breakin' the law came. 
Seen her tryna hold down two jobs,
Was tearin' up on me had a way (had a way). 
All my friends was gettin' in it 
It came time for me to get that dough. 
Wrong or right I had to go for what I know.

Lord I pray. Give me strength to forgive them and not all the I hate I got.
Even though the pain of this was too heavy. Lord I pray.
Show me all brothers growin' up without a father had a turn with a day adolescent to a legacy.
Lord I pray. 

From the knowledge I ain't get, 
God you gave me. 
And temptation was callin' me, didn't know which way to go.
