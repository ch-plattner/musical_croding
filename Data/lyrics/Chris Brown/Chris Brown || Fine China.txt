Baby (baby, baby), does he do it for ya? (for ya, for ya)

You're irreplaceable
Collectible (collectible)
Just like fine China (China)

[Verse 2:]

Took me awhile to find your love (hey, hey)
Ain't no amount of time in this world (ho, ho)
Save me a lot of time and just love me (hey, hey)
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready? (Ohhh)
