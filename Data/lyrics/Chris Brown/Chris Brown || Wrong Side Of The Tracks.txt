[Verse 1:]
Only 15 Minutes 'Til Ya Momma Comes Home From Work And I Know
That She Wouldn't Be Tickled Pink To Find Me Hurr (yeahhh)
Cause Even Though We Was Just Chillin And A Little Flirtin She Don't
Even Want Me Anywhere Near Her Baby Girl (oh no)

[Hook:]
So I Think I Better Leave
Grab My Coat Hat And Timbo's
And Bounce Through The Window
Cause The Last Song On The CD Was Skippin
And I Don't Want Ya Folks Catchin Me, You Trippin

[Chorus:]
Cause She don't Think
We're Old Enough To Fall In Love (In Love)
Cause She Swears That I'm From The Wrong Side of The Tracks
(But She Don't Even See)
She Don't See There's More To Me Than Just A Thug
(That I Ain't No Thug)
There's Nothing You Can Do When Opposites Attract
And It's Like That

[Bridge:]
All My Ladies In The House Tonight
Say Oooh... (Yeah)
Now If Ya'll Wanna Fall In Love With Chris Say
Oooh...
All My Ladies In The House Say Oooh...
(Aww Yeah That Sounds So Good)
Now Say Whoa... (ooh)

[Chorus:]
Cause She don't Think
We're Old Enough To Fall In Love (In Love)
Cause She Swears That I'm From The Wrong Side of The Tracks
(But She Don't Even See)
She Don't See There's More To Me Than Just A Thug
(That I Ain't No Thug)
There's Nothing You Can Do When Opposites Attract
And It's Like That
