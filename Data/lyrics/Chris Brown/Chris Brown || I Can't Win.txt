[Verse 1:]
Tell me what did I do
To make you hate me so much
Why you angry all the time?
Why don't you wanna ride for me?
Girl, we used to make love
When you called, I would follow
Now the only thing you love is a bottle
The only thing you got left is a shadow
Don't let this shit come between us
I'm wrong you're right, its okay with my heart
But its not how its supposed to be
You always say I'm done and finished
Fuck it, I'm wrong you're right
Please God help us
I guess I'm gonna leave it up to you tonight

[Hook:]
She ain't bluffin', she gon' do it
I think its time for me face to the music
I could really give a damn about my pride
But though with you I think its stupid
You gon' love with the lies, never compromise
Girl if you love me better prove it
I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Verse 2:]
Don't even matter if you screamin' yeah
Girl you don't love me, you don't love yourself
But it don't matter if you raising Hell
I miss you, I wanna kiss you yeah
I can't remember who you are babe
Remember when your heart used to say
Love me babe, love me babe
I know them bitches got in your way but,
Don't let this shit come between us
I'm wrong your right, its okay with my heart
But its not how its supposed to be

[Hook:]
She ain't bluffin', she gon' do it
I think its time for me face to the music
I could really give a damn about my pride
But though with you I think its stupid
You gon' love with the lies, never compromise
Girl if you love me better prove it
I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Verse 3:]
I'm not trying to waste our love
I'm just trying to save whats left of it
One day, one day my love
You gon' realized that you fucked up
And when that day comes my love
I'm gon' be the same one still lovin'
How are you gonna cancel me out?
Say I won't listen, but I'm listening now

[Hook:]
She ain't bluffin', she gon' do it
I think its time for me face to the music
I could really give a damn about my pride
But though with you I think its stupid
You gon' love with the lies, never compromise
Girl if you love me better prove it
I can't win, I can't win for losing
