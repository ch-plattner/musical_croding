
Baby I'll admit, I made a mistake
Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great
Tried it to my mind, went back to my heart, I know it ain't there
Sometimes I want it all
Go head cuss me out
Girl I understand I will stay right here
And take it like a man
I really need you back, babe what I gotta do
Let me be honest, straight up tell the truth

[Chorus] 
I haven't been the same since I left you,
I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand my heart is hollow
I didn't know Id end up like this
Said I didn't wanna, now I miss (you)
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud,
Baby I'll scream it out, I didn't know what I was thinking bout
Hollow
Thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets
I wanna fly back (can I come back) home
Without your love it's hollow

Girl
I will never be
The same no more
Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours
Many times, I didn't even try, and even when I told them lies, you stay wonderful girl
Can I least just get the chance to show you ah, that I'm not a little boy I won't make you cry
And it means now, All we need is time
We can get back to the way things were

[Chorus]
I haven't been the same since I left you,
I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand my heart is hollow
I didn't know Id end up like this
Said I didn't wanna, now I miss (you)
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud,
Baby I'll scream it, I didn't know what I was thinking bout
Hollow
Thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets
I wanna fly back (can I come back) home
Without your love it's hollow

Only so much I can take, this love is broken down
Come rescue me, I need your arms
Gently wrapped around
Say you need me, and don't let go
And just to put it simply, girl my heart is empty

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
I didn't know Id end up like this
Said I didn't wanna, now I miss
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud,
Baby I'll scream it, I didn't know what I was thinking bout
Hollow
Thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets
I wanna fly back (can I come back) home
Without your love it's hollow
