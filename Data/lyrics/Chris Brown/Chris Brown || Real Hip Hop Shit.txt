Look, in the summer  6-0
A little margarita blend
so I slip slow 
The type of nigga I am kind of skitzo
Never out of my element I let the fifth go
Shots in the club panic at the disco 
She of that M D M A that's from frisco
Hella chips call me mister Nabisco
Is that your bitch cause she
won't let my go wrist go
My techniques is just sex freaks
Skinny dipp with hot model bitches and lesbies
Imma put my tongue on they soul like a SB
But they don't know they scum to my soul they're just sexy 
Imma play dumb play that role in the 
SV is ridiculous
And can I get a girl with real ass and TITS
Most Respect in the world to my
real niggas Cause, all them fake niggas make me
wanna kill niggas, I stand alone fuck that gang bang shit!
they Nintendo blowing niggas
Cause this game ain't shit  
Is relevant that I am better than these 'veterans' 
They are sleeping on me like I been 
given them sedatives 
Sometimes I wish I had better
friends and better peers
Cause I know when it to the ends they disappear... 

[Kevin McCall]
Damn! Where they go? Where they go? Where they go?

Uhhh-See I'm doper than that shit 
Pookie was on in new jack city
This is why I'm getting rich 
without trying 
I ain't like fifty
cus whats good being rich if your dying
that shit is silly!
Call the the chain TLC all the ice make you chilly
I'm a pimp so you know I'm snatching your broad 
I'ma a real star your patrick from spongebob 
and in my city to the streets I'm Freeway Ricky
cus i keep the streets flooded with that crack music
I be selling cd's like them niggas push kilos
but I don't push weight unless there's plates
in the weight room 
Why you think I'm BUF? Blowin Up Fast 
Call me left hook cause I be  heavy on the gas
You would think I was a Spartan, 300 on the dash 
Either that or a martian in a space aircraft
Cus when you see that whip that I have, you be like "What the fuck was that?!"
