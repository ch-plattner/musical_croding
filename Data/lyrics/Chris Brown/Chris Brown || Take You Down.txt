[Verse 1:]
Here we are all alone in this room (oh)
And girl I know where to start and what we're gonna do (yeah)
I'll take my time we'll be all night girl
So get ready babe I got plans for me and you
It ain't my first time but babygirl we can pretend,
Hey let's bump and grind girl tonight we'll never end

[Chorus:]
Let me take you down
I really wanna take you down
And show you what I'm about
Can I take you now?
Your body body oh
Your body body up and down
So don't stop girl get it
Quit playing wit it
Can't wait no more
I wanna take you down

Take you down, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Pretty girl let's take it off in this room,
No time to waste girl you know what we came to do,
We got all night to try to get it right girl,
(hope you ready, hope you ready, hope you ready)
I hope you're ready, babe,
'cause here we go, we know how we do

[Pre-Chorus:]
It ain't my first time but babygirl we can pretend,
Hey let's bump and grind girl tonight we'll never end

You're freaking know,

And I bet that you (I bet that you whoa)
Think you know baby like a pro baby, so what you wanna do?

So bring it let's go baby! (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
