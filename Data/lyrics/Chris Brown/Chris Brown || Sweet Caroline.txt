[Verse 1:]
Oh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a 38 or a 45
And my hearts bleeding baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment
So I'll enjoyed the ride

[Hook:]
Eyes start rolling in
The back of my head
Girl I'm already gone
I can see all of nothing
What's happening
Can't even look at your face
Girl I'm fading away
Girl your drug is automatic

[Chorus:]
Higher than a fan
One sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds
It really feels like life
Sweet love of mine
Ohh
You're my sweet Caroline
My sweet Caroline

[Verse 2:]
Oh baby I'm down
As long as you do the same
I'll try the same shit
Right now, Right now
Baby tell me when you start to feel it
Damn ya fine
Yeah baby
Just let go of all the emotion
All the emotion
Just let it out
Flow with me

[Hook:]
Eyes start rolling in
The back of my head
Girl I'm already gone
I can see all of nothing
What's happening
Can't even look at your face
Girl I'm fading away
Girl your drug is automatic

[Chorus:]
Higher than a fan
One sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds
It really feels like life
Sweet love of mine
Ohh
You're my sweet Caroline
My sweet Caroline

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Here I go
When I step up in the spot like another block
When the nigga drop stop, you ain't even got a clue
Regularly man, a man that need to be seen
Medically tell me what you really wanna do
Generally niggas think they better than me boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's right I'm independent, I don't really understand it
That's when I let 'em down, I'm tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas bitch, I'm up to legendary view
Something from benal they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you need to get a better crew
Lights out, switch, I came up real close
Didn't know I back down, I don't wanna let it go
Damn folks, Shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those and I really blow
I didn't really wanna knew it
Then what? He gets a nigga that be flowing like a fluid
And I can damage a nigga, get every time on that, nigga
Get up on, it's nothing
We know the thing, we really do it
And ain't nothing really to it
Pull up, stop
How bout a drop top? Then I'm out, I got my glock cocked
It's always you that's over here
You not hop on the mic on a wrong black knock
Ya'll niggas know what it is
And you know the way I put it down for em
That's right, got em loose
And it ain't nothing baby girl,
You can see the grap on em
Now ya'll don't really want to get a better note
Fireworks, nigga I be givin em a show
Let me chill though I really met a pretty little hoe
Make her bounce on me but a nigga gotta go

[Chorus:]
Higher than a fan
One sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds
It really feels like life
Sweet love of mine
Ohh
You're my sweet Caroline
My sweet Caroline
