
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Go

This may be my last time, so I'm a do whatever
This may be my last chance, for me and you together
I can be your honeycomb (Your honeycomb)
And we can fly together
You're so sweet, I taste it baby
I just, I just

[Pre-Hook:]
I wanna see you putting it together like a number
Multiply the times we done took it all off
Or maybe, we should just add up our love
I know your heart, your kiss
Drives me crazy, babe
We don't gotta fake this shit when we're loving
Cause the other ones got it and they be lying about it
Can't live a day in our life
Just do what you you like

[Hook:]
Do what you like
Do what you like
Do what you like
Come on baby, It's your world I wanna live in, and I'm loving this feeling
Do what you like
Do what you like
Do what you like
Just like that, girl I know you like that
And we only got time to love

This won't be my last chance, so I'm a do whatever
It takes to get you out here
So I'm a be smooth and clever
Let me get in your comfort zone
Girl we can move together
Spinning 'round, I got you baby
I just, I just

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]

Said we only got time (we only got time to love)
We, we only got time (we only got time to love)
To love, to love (we only got time to love)

[Hook x2]

Yeah, time to love
Said we only got time to love
Said we only got time to love, baby
