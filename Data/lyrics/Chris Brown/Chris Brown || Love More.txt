I'm a get it
'Til we get it

'Til we get it
I'm a get it
'Til we get it

You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it's never enough
I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby you let go
And I'll pull you back
I let go
You ain't having that

We do it like rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room
And we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you
Then I love you
That's how it is

'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more
('Til we get it)
I'm a get it (I'm a get it)
'Til we get it ('Til we get it)
'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more
(I'm a get it)
I'm a get it ('Til we get it)
'Til we get it (I'm a get it)
(Turn up)

Why is it all so complicated
Baby this should be simple
It's driving me mental
When you back it up
It really drives me crazy
And you know what I'm into
Make me forget what we arguing about

We do it like rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room
And we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you
Then I love you
That's how it is

'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more
('Til we get it)
I'm a get it (I'm a get it)
'Til we get it ('Til we get it) we get it right
'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more
(I'm a get it)
I'm a get it ('Til we get it)
'Til we get it (I'm a get it)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo

But he settin' up to blow me uh
Said my Twitter picture 'mind him of Naomi uh
On the low I used to holler at his homie uh
Fuck it, now I'm about to ride him like a pony yeah
Okay thug prolly

I hope your pockets got a
Motherfucking pot belly
Or is it that you never ball John Salley
He had the Rolls and the Royce
The tone in his voice
Don't want a good girl
Naw hoes is his choice
Dick on H
Pussy on W
Mouth on open

Vroom vroom vroom get gasoline
Could I be your wife?
Naw we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped
Call me Django

'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more
('Til we get it)
I'm a get it (I'm a get it) I'm a get it
'Til we get it ('Til we get it)
'Til we get it right we gon' pop some more (I'm a get it)
I'm a get it ('Til we get it)
'Til we get it (I'm a get it)
