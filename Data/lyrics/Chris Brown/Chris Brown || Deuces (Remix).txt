[Drake:]
What you mean I ain’t call you?
I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
seems like we are arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
but I fucked you right, I will
I fucked you right I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real
you looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
you with all those curves and me without no breaks
ooh, I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
you feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs
and the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
uhh, and everytime I try and break it off
we just yell until we tired then I break you off
it’s useless all this fighting lets get past it now
even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around

[T.I.:]
Your wrist and fingers glisten
ice cold like Michigan
eh look at what we living in
here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
rather run around with them nothing ass bitches
then, go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
we used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemy’s
deep inside it’s killing me
but soon its gonna be killing you
to see her in that two seater, now that's gonna hurt your feelin’s boo
ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
by now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
she spoke her piece, I know, capisce
so love must be let go, released
into the wind, again again and deuces I must throw ya peace

[Kanye West:]
You know what, yo?
you a bitch!
you should have a travel agent cause you a trip
you should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
but all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
give her a kiss for me, her second son
get your mind right baby or get your shit together
you gonna be hot a little while
I’mma be rich forever
girl seducers, they come in Deuces
when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
he just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
hehe. I’m stupid
but I won’t get my drama on
what I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
so when you talk bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talkin’ bout

[Fabolous:]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
she was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
think I give two shits
you ain't gonna do shit
meet my two fingers, intro...deuces
if you knew better you’d do better
wanna get the middle finger but I got two better

[Chris Brown - Chorus:]
So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
know you gonna (miss me a little when I’m gone)

[Fabolous]
Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
four door Rizzy Royce
tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys
plus I make paper
come on that's old news
yesterday’s paper
oh, you talkin’, what about?
if it ain't how I kept you studded out
you might as well shut ya mouth
you’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

[Rick Ross:]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
she the only one is missing
got a bucket full of ice
and a watch to go with it
got a racing Lamborghini
have my homies scared to drive
haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
all the charter planes
now i’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag
red Louis belt
how can u love me baby, first you gotta love yourself !

[Andre 3000:]
The farewell email from a female
but I’m a player, ain't gonna tell you all the details
what it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
by the seashore, but she’s not a bore but neither a whore
who needs to know more
the kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door...for,
or run in your favourite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't your’s,
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
well enough to know if this is all she came for
but enough to know tonight excited she came four
times to my cousins house to see if I was there
get ya minds out the gutter man
we out here tryna have a good time
and here I am, all heavy with the words where
somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
but shit they asked for it
it’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
you start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive stop making sad songs

[Chris Brown - Chorus:]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her [x2]
