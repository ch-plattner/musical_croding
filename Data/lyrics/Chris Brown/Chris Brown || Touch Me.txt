[Se7en:]
I want you to, love me.
Like you never loved nobody else.

[Chris Brown:]
I don't know if it's your scent or your kiss
But I girl I love them
And time after time,
You give me, one of the greatest gifts
I want you to

I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me (touch me, I just want you to feel it girl)
Like when you're touching on yourself

[Se7en:]
So baby come over (I'm on my way girl)
If you take your time
You can love me right
(Can I love ya?, uh-huh, take ya time girl)
If you want me to slow it down
(I do, will you? I will, will you? I will)
I'm bitin' on the pillow, tryin' not to make a sound

[Chris Brown:]
Girl, it's okay, cause I want you to feel me, yeah, oh!
Cause your daddy's girl, I'm a show you how to love,
Show you how to love me girl

So lay down right there
So you can hold my head
While I'm kissing on your thighs
Girl I just need it one more time

I want you to love me (I want you baby)
Like you never loved nobody else (Can you do me girl?)
And I want you to touch me (Touch)
Like when you're touching on yourself (Like when your touching yourself)

[Chris Brown: Speaking]
And as I look into your eyes
Your body screams for my love
No fear, just me,
And as you feel me inside
My passion fits like a glove
No more fear, just you and me

I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me
Like when you're touching on yourself
