[1st Verse:]
It's been a struggle for me, 
wonderin why I can't get by with my life, 
but now I'm free, 
and I done did some right and wrong, 
but still I seen the light, 
and I done been around the sex and drugs, 
hustlin but mama aint raise no thug, 
and it took a little to see how real it could get, 
and how this life wasn't meant for me cuz I, 
see a lot of bad things on my block, 
but I aint tryna be a victim of a gunshot, 
I can't let them hold me down 

[Chorus:]
See all the things I heard about, 
see all the things I've read about, 
I seen the light 

[2nd Verse:]
It's kinda hard for me, 
to stay away from all these girls and the haters they don't like, 
that I'm fufillin my dream, 
but I'm just tryna do my thing, 
my nigga can't I live my life, 
I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders), 
and I'm only gettin older (older), 
but it's like it's gettin colder, 
I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes, 
I came a long way from my block, 
and I'm grateful for everything I got, 
I didn't let nothin bring me down 

[Chorus]
See all the things I heard about, 
see all the things I've read about, 
I seen the light 

[Rap:]
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a rightous spirit, 
they try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it, 
mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics, 
a large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it, 
like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it 
really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder, 
a current was occurin it was stirrin up my hunger, 
but I couldn't let the shit burry a nigga under, 
use to cry hopin all of this would pass, 
and then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass, 
a part of my swagga but apparently I won, 
I took my shades off and now I'm starin at the sun, 
I'm seein the light I'm seein the light, 
realizin that it's me in the light, 
I read about it read about it now I know it 

I coulda did wrong, 
I seen a lot of people hustle, 
but I left them things alone, 
I almost lost my friend to the struggle, 
but I guess that made me strong, 
made me strong, 
I seen a whole lot of drama, 
and it taught me how to fight, 
taught me how to fight, 
and I thank God for my mama, 
she showed me what was right, 
I coulda been in the dark, 
but thank God for the light, 
(I seen the light) I seen the light 

[End adlibs:]
all the things I heard about, 
I read about it I read about it oh, 
I seen the light I seen the light 
Mmm
