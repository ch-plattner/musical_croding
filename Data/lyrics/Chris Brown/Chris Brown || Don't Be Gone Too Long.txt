[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Ariana Grande]
I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere, draw the bridge behind me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Ariana Grande]
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old
See upon a fire out in space, zooming up behind me
All the wonder written on your face
Was there inside me

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Bridge x2: Chris Brown & Ariana Grande]
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me (baby don't worry)
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me

[Hook x2: Chris Brown & Ariana Grande]
