[Intro - Tyga:]
Yeah
Money comes so fast, the bitches won't last
Uhh

[Hook - Tyga:]
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Bust it open bitch (do it, do it, do it, do it)
What you working with (do it, do it, do it, do it)
Drop it to the floor (do it, do it, do it, do it)

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
Do it, do it, babe
For me, for me [x3]
[?]
Popping all these bottles
So just take that, take that
Shake that, shake that
Pull it to the side (do it, do it babe)
Do you wanna fly, I'm floating bitch
Go on do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga

[Verse 1 - Chris Brown:]
Hey little mama, I know you 'bout your paper
And my money, money green
I'm in charge, no [?]
I'ma provide everything you need
No middle man, no in-between
Girl quit burning all your flight miles
Just get on this jet with me
God damn
So much money niggas think I'm pulling credit card scams
Step up in the spot and bitches know just who I am
You call me dada
I buy my bitches prada
Eating shrimp and lobster
After that I eat her yaya

[Bridge - Chris Brown:]
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Tyga:]
That's dice game, she on the floor
At K.O.D. and Onyx too
She up early, that's high school
She taking flights, she comfortable
She put in time, she working hard
But not enough to bake cakes too
If she met a nigga like me
Nah, I'll spring break pussy loose
Hunnid, hunnid dollar bills
Throw it in the air
I'ma make it back nigga, I don't really care
[?] panties
Shit was soaking
Private room, now that pussy open

[Bridge]
