Lights out, countdown

I’ve been trying to get to you miss lady
All up in your house, fuck you on your couch
Take you to the bed I know you lazy
Then we go up and down, you’re screaming out that this dick amazing
And you gonna make a nigga wanna cuff you and wanna put me in a cage.
And Imma turn that ass out tonight
And I put all my money on it
I know you know my girl molly, so we’re fucking till the morning
You’re dirty, watching me put it on your body
Baby let me turn the lights down

[Chorus]

And I’ll be kissing and licking on your body
And you can ride me, cause you know this dick stupid, ain’t it?
And Imma roll the red carpet out for that pussy make that pussy famous
