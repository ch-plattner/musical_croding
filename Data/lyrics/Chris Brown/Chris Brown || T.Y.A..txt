Do you need to get your money back, you've been had, I hope u got a warranty
Cuz I been walkin' round with money bags in my bag shorty gonna roll with me
Girl u need to get ur money back you've been had I hope you got a warrantee
Cuz I been walkin' round with money bags in my bag shorty need to roll with me

And when I'm lickin' and I'm touchin superbad McLovin
Time to go night night bed time.

Sexy baby, lady

[Hook]
Oooooh I
Wanna kiss u between ur thighs
And when I'm lickin' and I'm touchin superbad McLovin
Time to go night night bed time.

[Chorus]
Make ur hands tounch ur ankles [x11]

[Verse]
Flow sick I need a mothafuckin' ambulance
Big knot so my jeans look like hammer pants
Flow sick I need a mothafuckin ambulance [2x]
Big knot so my jeans look like hammer pants
Get on the floor lil mama I'ma make ya dance
Hands on ya ankles, 3 point stance
6 inch heels, are those Balenciagas
Gimme that poker face, ha lady gaga
I'm like Sesame Street gotta eat cookie monster
Girl I can put it on ya, eat it la la la bamba
Nah let me chill low, just like my chain is
150 stacks now my jeweler famous
Don't I make it look easy?
Coolest nigga in this spot that's why they call me breezy

[Chorus]
Make ya hands touch ya ankles hands touch ya ankles [till song fades]
