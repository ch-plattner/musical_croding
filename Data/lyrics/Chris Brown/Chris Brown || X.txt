Then I'm a blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself I was fast asleep
Since you came around I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
Yi-yi-X, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer, if I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse, better if I don't speak
Devil's tryna tempt me, they just outline my shape out
Place me at the crime scene
I can see from this high up, you ain't got a heart girl
Privacy is for the cheater obviously you're deceiving

[Pre-Hook:]
I know
I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

[Hook:]
I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more

[Bridge:]
You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it
I, simply came here to party
Why, would I trip off that bullshit, when I'm on that good shit
I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)

Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my past oh
Go ahead burn it down, I'm a build me another one
All these clouds...
