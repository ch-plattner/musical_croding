[Intro:]
Haha, My Lil Drop Top Girl

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sweet Lil Something, Turbo Button
Four Fifty Eight, Engine Running
Her Legs So Sunny, I'm So Young Money
And That Base In The Trunk Got That Bxtch Bumpin
(That's My Shxt)
Don't Skip Nothing, Play It Loud
Til The Top Of The World For Me
I Fear Nothing, Ride Til The Cops Coming
Color Coops Seats Honey, I Went From
Rags To The Wrist, Glitter, Car 6, Rooms
And The Crib, Arcade I Did
Walk Your Azz Right In Girl, Leave In A Minute
Ever Had Sex On The Sand?
I Guarantee This Will Be The Ride Of Your Life,
Round The World, Do It All In One Night
Most Them Girls, I Play Em But Never Wife
But It's Something About You That I Like

[Pre Chorus:]
Girl I Really Love The Way You Look At Me
Ain't No Other Feeling That Can Drive Me Crazy
To-night Girl Tonight, It's Gonna Be The Night To Take You Down

[Chorus:]
Baby, Tell Me What You Doing Tonight Night Night Night
You Can Be In My Drop Top Girl
Take It All Out Tonight Night Night
Shawty, Don't Stop Now
Tell Me What We Doing Tonight Night Night
We Can Be In My Drop Top Girl, It's Only Me And You Tonight (Take It Off)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She Know She Love It, No Sheets No Covers
Give It To Her All Night, All Night Loving
Go Rubbers, Unh Unh, Let Me Touch It
Ain't A New Thing To Me, Unh It's Nothing
Girl, Just Say Something Baby
Drop Top Girls, Drive Me Crazy
Shawty Know That I Got What She Need Though
That's Why She All On Me For, Ha

[Pre Chorus:]
Girl I Really Love The Way You Look At Me
Ain't No Other Feeling That Can Drive Me Crazy
To-night Girl Tonight, It's Gonna Be The Night To Take You Down

[Chorus:]
Baby, Tell Me What You Doing Tonight Night Night Night
You Can Be In My Drop Top Girl
Take It All Out Tonight Night Night
Shawty, Don't Stop Now
Tell Me What We Doing Tonight Night Night
We Can Be In My Drop Top Girl, It's Only Me And You Tonight (Take It Off)
