Heeyy, uh, ummmm, heey, oh girl, oh girl

We did everything we could do
To try to make it work (we did, we did)
Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose (no way, no way)
Baby, I just don't know why I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't girl)
Baby, they know just know what to say, they trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change

I think, God will give you someone,
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be O.K. it will be alright.
You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)

I know that baby we would disagree constantly on the basic things (we did, we did)
You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)
Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side
Baby, they know just what to say.
They wanna keep us away from one another
But Maybe they're right for a change

I think, God will give you someone,
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be O.K. (O.K.), alright (alright), just fine (just fine)

I know, baby, baby, baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man that you need
You deserve it and I know that
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say
You'll find him (you'll find him) be patient

I think, God will give you someone,
So much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be O.K., it will alright, it will be just fine (just fine)

(Cause I know that baby)
I think, God will give you someone (someone better),
Better than me, trust me girl
(no more pain) O.K.,
(no more pain) Alright,
It will be just fine (just fine)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(You wanna know why I'm sure)
(sure, sure)
