Never thought it'd cost me 
Never thought it'd hurt me 
Never thought I'd fall in love.. 
But I did 

I feel like somebody dropped a ton of bricks on my stomach (now)
I can't eat 
I can't sleep 
And it hurts me so deep 

I heard people talk about it 
And laugh like it'll never happened to me 
Now look at me 
It caught me 
See how quick karma comes around 

Who says a man ain't supposed to cry? 
Wish I can crawl under a rock somewhere and just die 
Just want the pain to go away, today 

I don't wanna cry no more 
And I don't wanna hurt no more 
And I don't wanna love no more 
Especially if it causes this 
I don't want no part of it 
Because it hurts me so bad 

Even when it's sunny outside 
It still feels like it's raining 
No clouds insight
But I still need your umbrella (oh)
Sometimes I wish I would've never let you in 
And then, wish I never met you 
Fell in love with you 
Then I wouldn't feel like I do 

Who says a man ain't supposed to cry? 
Wish I could crawl under a rock somewhere and just die 
I just want the pain to go away, today 

I don't wanna cry no more 
And I don't wanna hurt no more 
And I don't wanna love no more 
Especially if it causes this 
I don't want no part of it 
Because it hurts me so bad 

Never thought it'd catch me 
Never thought it'd cost me 
Never thought it'd hurt me 
Never thought I'd fall in love 
But I did ooohh

Never thought it'd catch me 
Never thought it'd cost me 
Never thought it'd hurt me, like this 
I just want the pain to go away, today! 

I don't wanna cry no more 
And I don't wanna hurt no more 
And I don't wanna love no more 
Especially if it causes this 
I don't want no part of it 
Because it hurts me so bad 

Never thought it'd catch me 
Never thought it cost me 
Never thought it hurt me 
Never thought I'd fall in love 
But I did 

Never thought it'd catch me 
Never thought it'd cost me 
Never thought it'd hurt me like this 
Like, like this
