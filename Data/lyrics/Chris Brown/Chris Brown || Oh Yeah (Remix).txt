Ugly girls be quiet, all them models screamin perform it,

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Me you and her
When I leave I swerve
Let me see that kitty purr
2 Chainz best ever
Then I put her in the air
But I had to take her to the ER
Make the bed go eh err
Up and down like a see saw
Who saw? Who saw?
Got jazz like Utah
Tackle her like football
Your baby daddy's a Ru Paul
Big dog, who won't
I do the shit that you don't
Livin' life in the fast lane
So I bought me a two-door

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yo friends cant tell me nothing,
Your leaving with me I know you want me,
Its in your eyes, don't tell me lies,
don't give yo disguise, Cause Imma give it to you like OOOHHHHHHH YEEEAAAHHH!!!!

Oh yeah, oh yeah (girl you a pro)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (on the on the flo)
oh yeah, oh (yeah girl you got my heart)
oh yeah, oh yeah,
Oh yeah, oh yeah, (girl you a pro)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, (on the on the flo)
Oh yeah, oh (yeah girl you got my heart)
do it, do it, do it, do it,

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Do the right thing, act a fool
Be yourself, go on, girl
Aw yeah, real player
Like that-that, like that-that there
Champagne campaign
Oh man, turn up the frame
Burn up the frame
I'm in my game
What's my name? What's my name?
Ooh-ee, Snoopy
Give it to ya like "c'est la vie"
Life of the party, rockin' your body
Blowin' big, bag it up, Bob Marley
Ladies and gents, players and pimps
This is the shit, one hundred percent
So you can just shake it and make it and dip it
And wop it and pop it and drop it ?
I left the scene crisp and clean
CBDBGZ, we see she see
Weezy Breezy Snoopy
All of 'em love me
Wasn't my fault, left your girl with seasoning salt
D-O-double G, he's the boss
These and 'em all, life in song, aw

[Outro:]
Just go head and do the right thing, do the right thing,...
Do the right thing ohhh, just go head and do the right thing,
Do the right thing, And girl if you wont get naughty,
I don't need no key I just push button start it
