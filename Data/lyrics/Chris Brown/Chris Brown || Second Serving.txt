
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you [x2]

From the moment I saw you
I stopped everything cause nothing else mattered
Cause I had to have you
And I knew I couldn’t get nothing better
It felt like destiny
When cupid shot me with an arrow through my heart
When you’re next to me
I’m stupid in love

And your body’s telling me something
And we be sweating, making love
Bed bumping
Ooooh I hear you screaming
You’re yelling “give it to me daddy, I need it”

Girl you, you done made me change
Got me thinking about giving you this ring
It might seem strange but I
Love the way you make me feel when we sexing
We could do it on the plane
Even outside in the cold and rain
Girl, when we’re loving
I need a second serving of you

Ooh your lips I taste
And Imma slide my hands down to your waist
Damn I wish I could
Keep you prisoner for just a day
Got me thinking could you have my kids?
Big house and a dog, you my wife
Imma ‘bout to go all out
Take it all off ‘cause it’s going down tonight

And your body’s telling me something
And we be sweating, making love
Bed bumping
Ooooh, I hear you screaming
You’re yelling “give it to me daddy I need it”

Girl you
Well you know the rest
You done made me change (you done made me)
Got me thinking about giving you this ring (oh girl)
It might seem strange but I
Love the way you make me feel when we sexing
We could do it on the plane (oh yeah)
Even outside in the cold and rain
Girl, when we’re loving
I need a second serving of you

Take my hand
Let me put this ring on your finger
I’m your man
Girl, you got an R&B singer
And it’s a party (oh)
A party
Yeah it’s a party

Girl you make me!
You done made me change
Got me thinking about giving you this ring (girl)
It might seem strange but I (I, oooh)
Love the way you make me feel when we sexing
We could do it on the plane (yeah)
Even outside in the cold and rain
Girl, when we’re loving
I need a second serving of you

Oh, oh
I need a second serving tonight babe
I need a second serving tonight baby

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you [until song fades out]
