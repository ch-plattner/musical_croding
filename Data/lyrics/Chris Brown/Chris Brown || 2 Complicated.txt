[Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me &
I have so many regrets, this isn't how things used to be &
You're never satisfied
Guess what? I stopped fuckin trying
You suck!
In case you didn't know, you're horrible

But its always true
I'm always wrong anything I do
and I always go to war with you
and I lose yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
cause its felling like deja-vu
my head's spinnin around and you got me sayin

[Chorus]
I I I I You're way too complicated
I I I I I can no longer take it
I I I I We're no good lets just face it
I I I I Cause you're way too complicated

You're such a snobby girl
used to think you were a queen
damn, you sure did rain on my parade, ahhh
same old silly games you play
this is such a waste of time
I'm starting to think that you're insane
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

But its always true
I'm always wrong anything I do
and I always go to war with you
and I lose yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
cause its felling like deja-vu
my head's spinnin around and you got me sayin

[Chorus]
I I I I you're way too complicated
I I I I I can no longer take it
I I I I We're no good lets just face it
I I I I Cause you're way too complicated

[Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, now what else can I do?
I've had enough of your rules
Yeah, you way too Soduku, true
Ain't in no mood for proofs and square roots
Go ahead, run and find you another man 
Wh-Wh-Who can figure you out, I'm sick of your mouth
..............and sleep on the couch
Yeah, I stick to my decision
Chick I'm kicking you out
No mathematician, take the digits and bounce
You got me screaming out

[Chorus]
I I I I You're way too complicated
I I I I I can no longer take it
I I I I We're no good lets just face it
I I I I Cause you're way too complicated
