[Chris Brown:]
Yo, this Virginia
Straight from the country, right there with my kinfolk
Golds in my mouth and they put 26's on Benzo's
Dirt roads, back wood
They got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga we act hood
But I'm getting money with these white folk
Sippin and I'm faded, super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole
I said Okay Sarah Palin, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM

[Hook:]
More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn bitch I do it

And this the life we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'm a do this till I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm...
(I'm high)

Oh God, oh God

[Big Sean:]
Ok, wow, bow
Look at me now, chief like a indian
Talkin in clouds, I'm high as a bitch
I'm talking to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that ho, show 'em no love just throw em a towel
Still rocking Louis Vuitton condom, cause I'm so fucking in style, wow
New crib, crash that. Drove here, cab back
Now knock that pussy out, yeah that's just a little cat nap
Hold up, hold up woah
Don't be smoking my shit, I be smoking that fire
She be smoking my dick

[Hook:]
More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn bitch I do it

And this the life we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'm a do this till I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm...
(I'm high)

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Smoking, choking, always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car
Bitch I just push a button and did a show
Got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussion, no discussion
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and I'm living it
Fucking little bitch

[Hook:]
More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn bitch I do it

And this the life we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'm a do this till I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm...
(I'm high)

[Chris Brown:]
Real nigga never frontin'
Cause when you got it all
Everybody want somethin'
Middle finger in the air no fist pump
And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumping
Ah! Finally got this bitch jumping
Got this bitch jumpin'
Fly... that's me...
