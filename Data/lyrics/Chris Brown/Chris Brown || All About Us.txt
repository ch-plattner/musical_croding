Baby I'm sayin, the kinda man that I've come to now
To be out there playin
But babe I got alot to say
I want you to listen
Cause I've been a fool goin crazy
With out you with me
[x2]

Girllll ohhh I ohh I oh I
I've been stupid lately
Girl I apolagize, I owe you baby
Please don't bury me alive
Cause it's kilin me inside
And I can't lie
Ggirlll

I'm afraid that your cheatin
Must have been my love
Me neglectin your trust
As if it is enough, I messed up
I'm afraid, that your givin up
I did too much my love
Right now it's all about us
All about us all about us
My love

It's kinda crazy about my babe
She was never complain
She was never fed up with me
But I kept on changin
One time had the nerve to say
She was lamein
She couldNT compare
Them other girls wouldn't care
To be with me

Girllll ohhh I ohh I oh I
I've been stupid lately
Girl I apolagize, I owe you baby
Please don't burry me alive
Cause it's killin mee
And I can't lieee
I'm afraid
