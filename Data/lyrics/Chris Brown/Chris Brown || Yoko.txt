Bust a couple bands
Blow a 100 fast
I just made a hundred off of 50 pay
Where them bad Asian bitches holdin down my city at?
Where them girls from the A with that pretty face?
Round thing, yeah I’m on that loud thang
Pop another bottle, shooting corks at the crowd: dang!
Yeah, I’m a stunna, nah, I ain’t Baby tho
Young dude with the lazy flow
Watch all these ladies go
Crazy when I pull up right beside em
I do a buck 30, I’m just into flying
I smell like dirty money, plus this cookie that I’m lighting
Bucket’s full of ice and bottles on fire inside em

[Hook]
Call em Yoko Ono
Only ride solo
Mission for the dolo
One look in her eyes, she’ll eat you alive
She’s a man eater, ski mask diva
She might up ‘n leave you, but you can never leave her
You ain’t never had someone, you can never keep her
Tricking on the next man, he can’t have her either..
I Call her Yoko Ono

[Chris Brown]
Look, got a boatload of them Asian hoes
On vacation steady bakin with Jamaican hoes
I got cash boy, I don’t care what you makin ho
50 thousand on my wrist: I’m feedin eskimos
Damn! Put VA on this shit
Buy 100 fuckin bottles, let em spray in this bitch
My money flow real long, I do relays in this bitch
And you know I kill songs, it’s Burner, CB & Wiz
Alrighty now, ha, look at me, rose, I’m on nigga
15 grand on a what, That’s just my phone, nigga
Northern California, where blunts look like cones, nigga
Two up, two down, make that switch, yeah

[Hook]
Call em Yoko Ono
Only ride solo
Mission for the dolo
One look in her eyes, she’ll eat you alive
She’s a man eater, ski mask diva
She might leave you, but you can never leave her
You ain’t never had someone, you can never keep her
Tricking on the next man, he can’t have her either..
Call her Yoko Ono

[Wiz Khalifa]
Shades on, Polo white T
Me leaving here alone? That’s unlikely
Not a stoner bitch, but she like me
Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee
I jack them hoes, direct them hoes
Take ‘em home and let them hoes go live out their fantasies
They’re popping pills, I’m rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas
Out the back, as ain’t no tags when I’m shopping
And my bad filled with options so don’t ask what it cost
I’m in a Maserati coupe going so fast that I lost ‘em
And my bitch got so much swag that these bad bitches on us
Ah! Killing y’all, pow! (dag) get a a coffin
