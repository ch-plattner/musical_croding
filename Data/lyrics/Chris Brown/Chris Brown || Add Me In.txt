
Your body's an isosceles
And I'm just tryna try angles
Your love is trigonometry
Just tryna solve the whole equation

[Pre-Hook:]
What's it about you (about you)
I wanna love you
Picking you up, picking you up
So I can touch you
Should we do that? Can I do that? (baby)
Anwsers are usually in the back

[Hook:]
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love
Is that too much?
Substitution
What's the problem, girl?
Add me in

[Bridge:]
Baby just add me, baby just add me in
Baby just add me, baby just add me in

I'll calculate her home invasion
Divide your legs and count to 3 (3, 2, 1, come on)
He's just not the answer baby
And that's just my hypothesis

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

Girl if I said I loved you, I need you
Would you care?
So many things that I could learn
Baby if we do the math, it will equal up to me!

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
