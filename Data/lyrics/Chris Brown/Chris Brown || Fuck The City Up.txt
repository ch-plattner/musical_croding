[Verse 1]
Yeah
Girl it's late at night and I'm driving
Over to your crib for some action
And I just can't wait to put it down
I just wanna work you out, I'm pulling up in your driveway
If you keep the door unlocked, I'm coming in girl
A nigga going up the stairs into the bedroom
A bubble bath, rose petals on the floor
We gone do it all night, we gone do it all night

[Chorus]
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid
I'm hella paid
So Imma fuck the city up

[Verse 2]
Girl it's one a.m.
To me, I know thus kinda early
But lets take it in
For the night babe
But if you wanna bring your friends
She can come she can come
(fuck it up, fuck it up)
Just let me lay you both on the bed
Hands on the pillow
Imma go deep putting work in the middle
Ass up, face down.
Baby imma work it out
The three of us holding hands
Screaming a little
Both of yall can get it all (can get it all [x3])

[Chorus]
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid
I'm hella paid
Imma fuck the city up

[Verse 3]
The night life rough
I fuck the city up
Ride thus bitch all niqht, tell her giddy up
Champagne's for new dreams and new bucks
But life's to bright, thank my jeweler
Thus is the epitome when jealous niqqahs expect me to strike out like a felony
It's not my intention to lash out but you telling me a niqqah that he'll never be
One of the, the greatest
Bitch you hating cos a niqqah made
When I was cutting records in my fuckinq basement
A lUl lUl niqqah couldn't get a placement
But like a spaceship, I'm out of here
Not a fear, you bring the [cough]
I'll buy the beer
Looking at my chain is like a chandeleir
But these diamonds here
And these diamonds rare

[Chorus]
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid
I'm hella paid
So Imma fuck the city up
(something I don't know)
