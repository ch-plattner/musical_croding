[Rick Ross:]
Legendary, runners, you know me, o ooooh, o ooooh, Trilla, o ooooh, o ooooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account, my account can't count up all my money in an hour,
cause it's comin too fast and I'm scared it won't last, look that white girl in her face told her this was her last dance,
Oh MAN (cleaner), speed got my heart racin, see I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation ceasar salad,
ceasars palace, you not a boss little cause your cheese is garbage, in the benz ak ridin shotgun,
it's a benz cause your broke til you got one, it ain't nothing do 100 in the maybach,
throwin money out the roof mother mother brake pads.

[Chorus:]
Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, speedin, I'm speedin,
I can't stop it's all I know, from a youngin I was taught get doe, I'm speedin, speedin, I'm speedin.

[Verse 2:]
See people came lookin for me I got ghosts see the west coast close and up in the montrose
Big money boss major
American idol, I got fans like fantasia
Read between the lines or yo a** like fantasia
Get hit between the eyes he died they can't save him
I'm a mosh I'm weevin no no but I'm speedin
Staring at the skyline I got a million on my mind I'm the best
50 50's running out of time ricky ross
I'm the chill quarter mill for the time piece ya I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime beats

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Sittin in the living room watching the grammys wishing that was me that was on the grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me money rain on me
I was a d turmin I'll thirty shoe's of hillfiger
Homey help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Nap time cause my gift grew wings and now I'm flying down like the cool crew winds
Kells and ross on the hollywood scene red carpet and it's smellin like green
Now foss ? cause I got paid off calabra was the hit poppin on b boss

[Chorus]

We fly I think somebody followin we hear the helipad widya bish ? 
You worth fifteen million baby don't try to blow it all in one week
Overseas boss (I'm speedin I'm speedin)
I'm a fly away on you haters
And I came up so fast movies, endorsements, films... we own things... boss
