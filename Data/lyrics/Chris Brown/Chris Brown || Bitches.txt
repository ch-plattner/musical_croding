All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches ah

[Chris Brown:]
Higher than the moon, nigga what up
They ain't worth it, nigga need to shut up
While I'm in the pussy, face down in the buttock
It ain't shit to her, me im just a fuck up
Fuck a hand shake nigga we ain't brothers
On that West side where they reppin for they colors
If you talking big shit, then my dick will make you stutter
All up in your face like it's butter, [?]
Right now, make her scream my name and pipe her right down
Nasty I'm a king bitch, give a nigga a wipedown
Twenty four bitches, I'm rolling on chrome
My niggas are smoking on that loud
Bitch try to flunt, Imma blow your back out
I ain't thinking bout a nigga that walk past you
Bitch stole my blunt and said she love my tatoos
I'm that dude, I slang wood, that bamboo
But when she driving on that dick she a damn fool

[Hook:]
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches ah
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches ah
All these bitches I don't wanna see no niggas
All these bitches I don't wanna see no niggas
Really really though, all these bitches, i don't want no niggas
Cause the real niggas that post it up already with us

[Chris Brown:]
It's a habit, in the club bottle magic
Fucking with these ratchets no purses they got baskets
Its a hand out, these bitches high feeling guess they addicts
And I ask them are you in like Patrick
Playing with the pussy like it's madden
Fire like a dragon
The one say she like me then they all bandwagon
Been leadin as hoes, but they pretty like a pageant
She said she'd let me cut, I had to stab it, fo real though

[Tyga:]
Audemar, big bitch, big tipper
Super club, 20,000 for the liquor
You see the bitch I'm with, you'll probably never get her
No cop bottles, they're for broke niggas
In the corner posted it up with the dome giver
Money flowin like a wet pussy, thats a long river
So you got your bitch on lock, I'll slim jim her
It's that time of the month, fuck timber
All my niggas got a bottle with a blunt lit up
Before you pop up, throw your set up
Hop in this bitch 'til the club's lights lit up, leave with her
Big spender, a bitch shut up
T-Killa illuminati all through your body
She blow me like a twelve gang shawty you feel me
Pull up in the 'rari, the fuckin life of the party
I'm getting hoes regardless
Before this rap shit, I'm honest
