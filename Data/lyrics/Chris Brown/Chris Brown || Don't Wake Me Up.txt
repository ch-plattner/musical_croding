[Spoken:]
Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams... don't wake me up.

[Verse 1:]
Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming about your lips

[Chorus:]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up [3x]
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me.
Don't wake me up [3x]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me.

[Verse 2:]
So much life in the city. You won't believe
Been awake for some days now. No time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music inside my head

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2x:]
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep. No.
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

[Chorus]
