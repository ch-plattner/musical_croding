
I got my keyboard 
Symbols all ready 
Pull up the strings 
And leave the bottom all heavy 
Palms all sweaty 
This feels like a dream 
Little excited, you know what I mean girl 
Girl I'm in need for a woman that can play 
Knows how to turn it up loud 
Anytime of the day 
Take my cd and baby press repeat 
It ain't no need to speak 
Just let it play (play) 

Well you got my attention now 
I can't let you down 
Your lyrics and your sound 
Imagine me and you 
What we gon do oo (just listen) 
But wait before the break down 

Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Lay back and just let it spin 
This music is your friend 
Love music (love music) 
Nobody has to know 
Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Can't wait to get this party started 
I'll hit the switches 
Let me remix it 
(Sit back) and listen to some love music 

Turn my mic up 
Can you loop it now 
From the rythum of the track 
And it ain't gon change 
The tempo stays the same 
Let it flow through the music now 
And I just want to see you smile 
Now forget about what it is 
So baby take my cd 
And baby press repeat 
It ain't no need to speak 
Just let it play 

Well you got my attention now 

I can't let you down 
Your lyrics and your sound 
Imagine me and you 
What we gone do (just listen) 
But wait before the break down 

Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Lay back and just let it spin 
This music is your friend 
Love music (love music) 
Nobody has to know 
Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Can't wait to get this party started 
I'll hit the switches 
Let me remix it 
(Sit back) and listen to some love music 

No matter what the record is 
Anytime it plays girl 
My heart skips a beat 
I feel it in my soul 
I'm about to over load 
It's takin control of me 
We're the perfect harmony 
Lets just keep the speakers blasting 
And I wont stop (I wont stop) 
Til we burn out together 

Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Lay back and just let it spin 
This music is your friend 
Love music (love music) 
Nobody has to know 
Lets listen to some love music (love music) 
Can't wait to get this party started 
I'll hit the switches 
Let me remix it 
(Sit back) and listen to some love music 

Love love music 
Love love love music (love music love music) 
Love love music 
Love love love love music (love music love music)
