I wanna wake up baby
And see u sharing my bed
U roll over start smiling
Girl I'm a cook u breakfast
Yeah I gotta say u got my heart
And your my answer when I'm reaching for the stars (oh)
I don't need nobody else but u

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a let u play babe
Music in the car
Shawty your my favorite song
Your my baby
Kissing on your neck and don't even need permission cause your body saying yes
And u know that I want it (girl!)
So just let me get it girl
When it all said and done
