
You got me doing 101 on the 101
Don't go nowhere baby, don't you run
You got me doing 101 on the 101
Got me speeding for your love

I been waiting for you all day
Stuck in traffic, tryna make it to my baby
I'm tryna go half on a baby
Just wear that sexy shit I like
And I will do you just right
Don't you worry, help is soon on the way
I'll kiss you up
I'll lick you up
I'll stick it up
I'll smack it up
I'll flip it up
I'll pick you up
I'll sex you up
I like it when your bottom up
Your top down, take you down
Won't fuck around
I'll hold you down
I'ma break it down
When I lay you down
Yeah
