[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so (A-A-to the L-I-Y-A-H)
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Don't let them tell you any different
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
I owe it all to you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it

[Bridge:]
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear
But we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
'Bout you and me (How could they know)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
At my best you loved me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
Even though at my worse
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends
We're connected
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
What did I do to deserve you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it

[Bridge:]
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear
But we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
'Bout you and me (How could they know)

[Verse 3: Aaliyah]
How could they know [x4]
Thank you for the autographs
And the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I model now
Actin' now
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards
That they gave me
You stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
Think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasn't my for you
I don't know what I would do (ooh)

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
'Bout you and me (How could they know)
