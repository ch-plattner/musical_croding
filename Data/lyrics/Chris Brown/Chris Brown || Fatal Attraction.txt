Ooh Ooh
Talking wreckless all night
You gotta make that happen baby
You got me excited baby
Ooh Ooh
How come the one you got, ain't never the one you need
Listen to me
You say you
You talking 'bout you gon' walk out on this crazy dude
but I don't believe you
I don't really care about all that
So I keep coming back
I can't help myself

You make it harder for me
Don't wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on girl
You know just what I need and I
Know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)

If it was all up to me
We do it over and (over) over again
But girl what about your man
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)

Ooh baby I'm swear it
I want you to myself
Just how we got here
It's gon' take everything for me to leave you alone
'Cause the vision that I get
Wanna make your body - be calling me
Baby you know you
Like to give it to me
Girl, you know how we do
I used to try and act like I ain't need you before
But that was before
You make me want you more
Girl if he only knew

You make it harder for me
Don't wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on girl
You know just what I need and I
Know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)

If it was all up to me
We do it over and (over) over again
But girl what about your man
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)

You make it harder for me
Don't wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on girl
You know just what I need and I
Know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)

If it was all up to me
We do it over and (over) over again
But girl what about your man
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction (fatal attraction)
