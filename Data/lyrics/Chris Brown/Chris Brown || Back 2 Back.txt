[Voice mail:]
Hey You Reached Jessica
I'm Not In Right Now
But If You Leave a Message
I'll Call You Right Back

[Chris Brown:]
Baby,
I Called You Three Times, I Left Text Messages,
Emails...
I Mean What I Gotta Do To Get To You...
I Mean It's Like...
What's So Important You Can't Pick Up The Phone...
I Mean Come On...
I Can't Deal With It...
Call Me Back...

[Verse 1:]
Lately
More and More I Been Feelin Some Kind Of Way
And I Ain't Crazy
I Know You Got Those Texts From Me
(Got 'Em From Me, whoaa)
But It's This Thing
That We Been Goin Through
Is Somethin Wrong With You? (With You)
All It's Doing Is Makin Me Remember
How We Called It Quits
Girl I'm Too Young For This
When You...

[Chorus:]
When You Turned Away From Me
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back
Oh I...
Don't Want You Mad At Me
Snatchin The Covers
Actin Like You're Asleep
When You Know You're Up, nooo
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back

[Verse 2:]
All Night Long
I Find Myself Tryna Get Away
And That Ain't Right, nooo
Lookin Through My Phone
Tryna Remember Her Name
That Would Only Make It Worse
We Try To Talk Through Our Problems
But It Takes More Than Words
Said It Don't Even Bother Me
But I Swear It Hurts
When I Said I Didn't Wanna Go Through The Same Shit
This Is What I Meant, ohhh...

[Chorus:]
When You Turned Away From Me
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back
Oh I...
Don't Want You Mad At Me
Snatchin The Covers
Actin Like You're Asleep
When You Know You're Up, nooo
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here, Back To Back

[Bridge:]
I Thought About It, Got My Bags Now I'm Bout' To Roll
You Standing There Screaming
(Please Don't Go)
Too Late (No Excuses)
I Swear I Can't (Do This)
Don't Wanna Go Through This No More (No More)
Now I Know What It Means To Really Have It (Bad)
But I'm Laying This Bed And Looking At Your (Back)
(Your Back Yeah)
Ohh Girl (Oh Girl)
That You Gon' Make Me Believe
That You Gon' Change For Me (Oooohhh)

[Chorus:]
When You Turned Away From Me
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave (Just Leave Ohhh)
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back
Oh I...
Don't Want You Mad At Me
Snatchin The Covers
Actin Like You're Asleep
When You Know You're Up, nooo
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here, Back To Back
