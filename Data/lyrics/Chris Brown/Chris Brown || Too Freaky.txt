I got that long money,
So is my dick,
Change my pamper homie cos I'm on that new shit,
My chains too big,
150 stacks,
And the yacht lookin' something like a crew ship,

I got that long money,
So is my dick,
Change my pamper homie cos I'm on that new shit,

I got that long money,
So is my dick,
Change my pamper homie cos I'm on that new shit,
My chains too big,
150 stacks,
And the yacht lookin' something like a crew ship,

Roll with me,
We could float away,
And we can hop in the jaccuzzi filled with Rose
All that extra space,
Yea it cost a grip
Stuntin on shawty, she a bad chick

I will take you down if you let me do it,
Girl you can get all of me if you let me do it,

Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop
Wanna hear my name when you on top,
Cos you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky,
Girl I wanna work lemme do my job,
Call me Bang Bang cos I go so hard,
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky

Wait babe, won't you come over and play babe,
Bet you I can make that nanana scene,
Have you in the kitchen licking your plate clean,
All up on the counter,
Lady, have you had it good lately,
Imma give you what you need, right now

I will take you down if you let me do it,
Girl you can get all of me if you let me do it,

Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop
Wanna hear my name when you on top,
Cos you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky,
Girl I wanna work lemme do my job,
Call me Bang Bang cos I go so hard,
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky

Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop
Wanna hear my name when you on top,
Cos you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky,
Girl I wanna work lemme do my job,
Call me Bang Bang cos I go so hard,
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky
