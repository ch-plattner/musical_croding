
Dim the lights
Where are the party girls, all my party girls
Living life with all these beautiful women
He don't do you right, I'll treat you better
Like you've never had it
I can see the big picture, you get the message
Let me tell you what we gon' do tonight
Champagne gon' get you right
I can tell you the freaky type, I just need the green light
Baby, let me set your body free, sun up to sun down
Kissing you, you kissing me
You know it's alright

[Hook:]
Girl I see you dancing
Tell the waiter to bring more shots over here
This one's for you girl
It's for you girl
Just for you girl
This one's for you girl
It's for you girl
Just for you girl
I'm about to do some body shots

Don't run away, what you running from
Know you wanna come with me
Let's run away tonight, together, forever baby
End the night like you never done before
Find my love, in the lights
Go away, the rays are on you now
I bet nobody ever did you better
Moving at the speed of sound
I'm tryna find your hidden treasure
Diving deep, girl I'm going down

[Hook]

Turn the fuck up!
