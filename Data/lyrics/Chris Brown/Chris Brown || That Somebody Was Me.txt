Tell Me Do You Remember When
You Were Talkin To Your Best Friend
And She Mentioned
There Was Someone, A Gentleman
Who Was Trying His Best To Extend
An Invitation

If You Get To Know Me
Baby It'll Be A Really Good Thing
Baby No Strings
I Know It Seems Like I'm Comin Off Strong
I Hope You Don't Mind Spendin Time
Just You And Me (Just You And Me)
I Know You Will Have A Good Time
That Somebody Was Me
I'm The One That Called You Up
With The Blocked ID For A Week
See I Was Holding Back My Feeling
Wasn't Sure How You Would Respond To Me
It Was Me Girl

Girl I Bet You Remember When
You Went Out With Your Girls Clubbin
And Dancin Yeah
You Glanced At A Gentleman
I Got Your Number From Your Girlfriends
They Said You Was Wrong

If You Get To Know Me
Baby It'll Be A Really Good Thing
Baby No Strings
I Know It Seems Like I'm Comin Off Strong
I Hope You Don't Mind Spendin Time

Just You And Me (Just You And Me)
I Know You Will Have A Good Time
That Somebody Was Me
I'm The One That Called You Up
With The Blocked ID For A Week
See I Was Holding Back My Feeling
Wasn't Sure How You Would Respond To Me
It Was Me Girl

That Somebody Was Me
I'm The One That Called You Up
With The Blocked ID For A Week
See I Was Holding Back My Feeling
Wasn't Sure How You Would Respond To Me
It Was Me Girl
