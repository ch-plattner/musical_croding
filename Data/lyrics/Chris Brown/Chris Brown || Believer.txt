[Verse 1:]
See the days are gone and I've been loosing my mind
I'm crashing I'm running out of time
Now the way that I perceive things
Hopin you wont deceive me
But its just the feeling inside that I had to find a way to find out
This relationship is about
Seems like you want to count me out (count me out)
But you were the one who changed
Thought it would stay the same but it still remains

[Chorus:]
Baby I'm a believer
Pain and the love
Baby girl I wont either
Even though you might say both of 
Us need a breather 
Gotta hate it all
Had to take that fall 
Baby to let you know that
I'm a believer the reason that you should stay
Is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever 
We could
Love again
Wanna be ya friend
We can win I'm a believer

[Verse 2:]
Baby girl sit it down come around and take it straight
Don't need to end my life girl
I want you around there's no need to frown
Girl give your
Love to me 
I want ya
I need you
Every night and day
Hopin that we stay together
But can I hold you in my arms
Thought I was playing
I'm saying
Baby girl

[Chorus:]
I'm a believer
The pain and the love
Baby girl I wont either
Even though you may say both of us
Need a breather
Gotta hate it all
Had to take that fall
Baby to let you know
I'm a believer the reason that you should stay
Is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
Wanna be ya friend
We can win

[Hook:]
Can you stop blaming me for it just this once
Can you commit to my love
My hearts breaking down
Girl you know that I will never leave your side

[Chorus:]
Baby I'm a believer
Pain and the love baby girl I wont either
Even though you might say need a breather
Gotta hate it all
Had to take that fall
Baby to let you know
I'm a believer the reason that you should stay
Is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if im an achiever
We could love again
Wanna be ya friend
We can win
I'm a believer
I'm a believer
I'm a believer
I'm a believer uhhhh oooh ooooh uhhhhh
I'm a believer in you girl
