[Verse 1: CHRIS BROWN]
Yeah
Girl it's late at night and I'm driving
Over to your crib for some action
And I just can't wait to put it down
I just wanna work you out, I'm pulling up in your driveway
If you keep the door unlocked, I'm coming in girl
A nigga going up the stairs into the bedroom
A bubble bath, rose petals on the floor
We gone do it all night, we gone do it all night
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)

[Chorus]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid

So Imma fuck the city up

[Verse 2: TANK]
Girl I been thinking about you all night
How we hit them streets
And tore till daylight
Yeah with the top down spinning
Couldn't wait to get in
And fuck it up, fuck it up
This D&D got me crazy
All up in the stadium
Tryna find a lady
Yeah I gave a couple racks to a ten
And every time I'm in the city
We gon' get it in
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)

[Chorus]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid

Imma fuck the city up

[Verse 3: CHRIS BROWN]
The night life rough
I fuck the city up
Ride thus bitch all niqht, tell her giddy up
Champagne's for new dreams and new bucks
But life's to bright, thank my jeweler
Thus is the epitome when jealous niqqahs expect me to strike out like a felony
It's not my intention to lash out but you telling me a niqqah that he'll never be
One of the, the greatest
Bitch you hating cos a niqqah made
When I was cutting records in my fuckinq basement
A lUl lUl niqqah couldn't get a placement
But like a spaceship, I'm out of here
Not a fear, you bring the [cough]
I'll buy the beer
Looking at my chain is like a chandeleir
But these diamonds here
And these diamonds rare
So baby can we play a little game
Girl your body on mines (up and down)
Just make me work for it, work for it
Imma give you the business and girl you gone get it when I start really using my tongue (baby)

[Chorus]
Yeah girl, whenever I'm in your city, and you know Imma blow bout fitty.
Imma fuck the city up (now, yeah)
Imma give my love to you, you
Imma fuck the city up
I'm coming over babe, over, over babe
Imma fuck the city up
I'm hella paid
I'm hella paid
So Imma fuck the city up
(something I don't know)
