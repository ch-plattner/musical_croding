[Chris Brown Talking:]
Girl, won't you just listen (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Please (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1:]
I never really thought
I'd be sittin' here all alone
Starin' down at the phone, damn
What did I do that was so wrong

And girl
I never thought
That you would move on
Can't believe you're gone
It's killing me my heart
Ain't your home

(And now)
Thought I was the one
But you done left me out
(And now)
And now

[Chorus:]
Now I can't see nothing
Now my everything done
Turned to nothing
What can I do
What can I say
Nothin'
Wish I could've stopped
You walkin' out
Should've screamed out loud

Baby can't you hear me (Can you hear me)
Don't you miss me (miss me)
Because I'm hurting girl
I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me
Or something (yeah)
But you ain't sayin' nothin, no

[Verse 2:]
I never even gave you one-hundred percent
I never said what I meant, damn
Girl, I never thought you'd be burned out
Now my heart is breaking down
It's killing me, I can't save it
And it's gone

(And now)
Thought I was the one
But you done left me out
(And now)
And now

[Chorus:]
Now I can't see nothing
Now my everything done (everything done turned)
Turned to nothing
What can I do
What can I say
Nothin'
Wish I could've stopped
You walkin' out (why did you walk out of my life)
Should've screamed out loud

Baby can't you hear me (hear me)
Don't you miss me (miss me)
Because I'm hurting girl
I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me (wish that you would talk to me yeah)
Or something
But you ain't sayin' nothin, no

[Bridge:]
One of the things I missed most (ooh)
Is how you make me feel so right
(and even though you're gone)
I'm all alone (I dreamed of you day and night)
Day and night
I'm breaking down
(I wish that my baby was next to me)
Next to me, can't you see
(casue I don't know if you're ready for love)
I don't know, Ooooooh

[Chorus:]
Now I can't see nothing
Now my everything done (now I got nothing)
Turned to nothing
What can I do
What can I say
Nothin'
Wish I could've stopped (what can I say)
You walkin' out
Should've screamed out loud

Baby can't you hear me (hear me)
Don't you miss me (miss me)
Because I'm hurting girl
I wish that you could feel me (feel me)
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk (oh) to me
Or something (oh)
But you ain't sayin' nothin, no

[Fade:]
Now I can't see nothing (no)
Now my everything done (no no no)
Turned to nothing
What can I do
What can I say
Nothin'
Wish I could've stopped (what can I say)
You walkin' out
Should've screamed out loud
Baby can you hear me
