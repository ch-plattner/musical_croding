Hey girl
We should take this up to  my room
(uh-oh-uh-oh)
Cause I wanna lay  you down
Do some dirty things to you
(uhh-ohhhh)

In between the sheets
You and me
Girl I'm a freak
I'mma give it up
Guaranteed to go all night
(Yo legs) wrapped around (round) my head
On my shouldah
You can teach me girl

All it takes is one drink 
one touch
one kiss to open you up
Girl your body turns me on right now
On right now
On right now
You know I got the key to your heart
Key to your heart [x4]
You know I got the key to your heart

Hey girl
Why don't you slip into that sexy lingerie I like
(oh-yeahhhh)
I wanna play girl
So baby show me all the games you like
(ohhhhhh)

In between the sheets
You and me
Girl I am a freak
I'mma give it up
Guaranteed to go all night
(Yo legs) wrapped around (round) my head
On my shoulder
You can teach me girl

All it takes is one drink 
one touch
one kiss to open you up
Girl your body turns me on right now
On right now
On right now
You know I got the key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
You know I got the key to your heart

I'mma open two more bottles
Baby let me know if you want more
Tell her we don't need more ice cause baby girl you cold
You making me come out of my clothes
I just want to make you so ohh
And baby we can get right to it
We can skip the foreplay
I can't wait to see you ride
And I'll be the lover of your life

All it takes is one drink 
one touch
one kiss to open you up
Girl your body turns me on right now
On right now
On right now
You know I got the key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
Key to your heart
You know I got the key to your heart
