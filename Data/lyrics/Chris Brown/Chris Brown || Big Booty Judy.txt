That's alright

Judy got a booty from here to there
Makin' nigga smile from ear to ear
Order 3 more bottles of that belvedere
Then I point it out like you come here

You come here
And you come here

Booty sittin' higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap
Some really can't know
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles

Speakin' of ankles bend over and touch your toes
Rub it and make it roll I'm lovin this angle
Hah, I love this view that I'm lookin' at

Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant
Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been
So I'mma give it to like a motherfucking veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine

And I don't know her name
She told me but all I heard...

Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazin' (amazin')
Yeah, she got me goin' insane
And I don't even really know her name

I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye) [7x]
Big big booty Judy

Now, now, now Judy is her name
I beat it out of frame
I'm messin' with no busties' or no suckers cause they lame

She drop it low and sit it up
Other niggas fissin' up
'Cause when they see that ass
Tell like "damn what you feedin' her"

Her, her, her body so ridiculous
I kiss it when she ticklish
Big booty world record
You can find it up in Guinness

And no, no, no it's not a gimmick
Shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (big donk)
Ayoo

Damn girl I'm horny
Hangin' out I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it

I tell her hold this
She got baby makin' hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss

Miss Parker, Miss Parker
When you go let me (oh)
Miss Parker
She whispered in my ear right now
Then me her in her booty all smile

Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazin' (amazin')
Yeah, she got me goin' insane
And I don't even really know her name

I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye) [7x]
Big big booty Judy

I know this cutie
Her name is Judy
She's a yellow bone
Big chick mega booty

Shawty got a donk
Booty superpunk
And she keep it keep it shakin'
Like a base in the trunk

Well six fifteens
His swag so mean
And I wanna know how she get up in them jeans
She gon' be my baby mama
She is all me

She's a bad bitch
Greet her "Hello, Barbie"

Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazin' (amazin')
Yeah, she got me goin' insane
And I don't even really know her name

I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye) [7x]
Big big booty Judy
