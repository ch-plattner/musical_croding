Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say, 
she drop it on the floor, and it's money on the way. 
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When you talk about that money patty cake, patty cake.
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When the media just talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up.
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
Living every fucking day like judgement day.

I'm grinding hard, but this money is calling the shots.
Got that big bank, and this money long, and they sticking they hand in my pot.
With this Rolex I Bowflex, my ears looking like rah.
Better better go ahead with that bullshit, cause I am something you not.
Better put you hands up if you wanna knuckle up, take you for that ride you better buckle up.
I got bands up for them dancers, when your shift is up you can come fuck with us.
It's a real nigga up there, it's some real niggas in here.
Girl better get up on me, before a real nigga disappear.
Got that Ghoster outside waiting, got them posing, cameras hating.
Got my shades on, nigga want to talk that shit I'm elevating.
All my ladies celebrating, if my bitches catch you slipping,
You'll be tied up in my basement, no location, that shit cray.
Haha
What you mean I got a big head?
Oh, you talking about my dick.
What you mean that shit padded?
Oh, you talking about my bitch.
Talking about I'm a light bright?
You talking about my wrist.
Didn't know I could rap, right?
Nah, but this that shit.

Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say, 
she drop it on the floor, and it's money on the way. 
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When you talk about that money patty cake, patty cake.
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When the media just talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up.
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
Living every fucking day like judgement day.

Ya'll not cooperating, my occupation is to occupy, all this fake shit.
Communication with your lady, in my new Mercedes.
We riding around with my top down, to much smoke up in her weave.
Better let that shit air out. (Yikes!)
Better give me that na na, call me dada, and call me papa.
Imma be your cookie monsta, Gold cookie like a nigga Willy Wonka.
But you know a nigga really want ya.
Bang bang, and do the damn thing, and then I hit it again, and make a bitch roll up.
I own this necklace, matter fact all of this my shit.
That's my ring, that's my Range, I'm about to make your bitch my bitch.
I said money ain't never no issue, crying niggas go on get a tissue.
It was crazy in the club last night, and nigga we ain't see you.

Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say, 
she drop it on the floor, and it's money on the way. 
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When you talk about that money patty cake, patty cake.
I say I'm,
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
When the media just talk about a nigga, smoke a blunt and roll up.
Bitch I'm paid that's all I gotta say,
Living every fucking day like judgement day.

Liquor got me tipsy, I'm slow leaning.
Looking at her titties, she high beaming.
She looking at my chain but, all she really want is my semen.
Imma let her get it, right on her face, clear it up like Naczema.
Now a nigga like me, I can do a rap song any day of the week.
Singing ass nigga, tatted up, ya'll ladies know I'm a freak.
You know I'm a freak, you know I'm a freak.
It's Brezzy bitch, (Yikes!) 
A nigga cold on the beat.
Yikes!
Cold as ice!
Yikes!
Breezy
