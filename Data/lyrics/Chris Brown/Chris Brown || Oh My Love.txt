
I'm a bad man but I'm a sucker for love like I'm an addict 
Girl I really love the way you're looking at me 
So I'ma show you the meaning of what a man is 
I'm nasty, car go zoom-zoom and then the speakers in the trunk go boom-boom 
I can give it to you fast or slow, girl I'm a gentleman I'll open your door 
Get the party started like whoa-whoa, spinning a lot tonight 
Hoping you stay tonight ending the party right 
Whoa-whoa, take everything off your mind we can just take our time 
Whatever you want 
I-I, got a lot of money but that don't mean shit cause I need you honey 
Baby I gotta have you girl 
Lemme get it, when I get it, if I get it, I'ma kill it 
Baby when you get it we be rolling on the floor like 
Baby you so gifted when you kissing on my lips 
Then when we switchin' the position you ain't ever gotta slow down 
I can be the, be the lover, lover of ya life 
I just wanna be under the covers for the night, 
Take a look around, put your hands in the air like the ceiling's falling down 

[Chorus:]
Take a chance with me, girl you know that I won't do you no harm 
Oh my love, you got my heart, heart, heart 
Yeah, you know we're meant to be, yeah 
All this magic you should wish on a star 
Oh my love you got my heart, heart, heart 

I'm a bad man, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am baby say that 
I'm a bad man and I can't and I can't and I can't just cause 
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a bad man (I'm a bad man) 
I'm a bad man 
Whoa-whoa, spinning a lot tonight 
Hoping you stay tonight ending the party right 
Whoa-whoa, take everything off your mind we can just take our time 
Whatever you want 
I-I, got a lot of money but that don't mean shit cause I need you honey 
Baby I need your love 
Lemme get it, when I get it, if I get it, I'ma kill it 
Baby when you get it we be rolling on the floor like 
Baby you so gifted when you kissing on my lips 
Then when we switchin' the position you ain't ever gotta slow down 
I can be the, be the lover, lover of ya life 
I just wanna be under the covers for the night, 
Take a look around, put your hands in the air like the ceilings falling down
