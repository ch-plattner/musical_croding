We back in our zone baby
What it is baby?
I’ma do some thangs, then you gonna do some thangs
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me, give it to me, Boing
Get you there and then you go down and up
I know that its a little much but girl I’m so tempted to touch, Boing
It’s heating up, 90 degrees I’ll beat it up
Oscar De La Hoya baby spanish flying in your love, Boing
Bouncing off of my pogo stick your cotton candy gummy bears
I can’t get enough of it, Boing
Your chocolate covered hershey kiss come and blow my candle out
I promise you can make a wish

Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing
When you’re down, one two three I won that round
bedroom bully you should know me baby girl a lot of sounds, Boing
Harder the sound that you make, take a second, catch your breath
I’m on the way, Boing
Cause girl I got that magic potion
Rowing back and forth, yeah thats the motion in the ocean, Boing
And I take you away, more than once in a day
Cause baby girl I catch ya, yeah, yeah

We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl

Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing
Do it to me I’ll return the favor, baby we can do it now or later
It’s up to you, tell me what you wanna do
Just space and opportunity in between us
You ain’t expect me to make that thang bounce
You ain’t expect me to take that thang down
You ain’t expect to bounce like the springs in the bed
So let me give it to you till you’re shaking your legs
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Let’s switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing.
