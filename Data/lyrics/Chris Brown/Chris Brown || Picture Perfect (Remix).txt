Low key

She just put her drink on my pollo fleece 
Speedin

Came to the party with a bunch of orgies 
Ladys wearin crown holders and a bunch on Coogi 
Now they lookin and the fellas know what I got 
Can't nobody get her but me 
Fliest thing in this spot 
Prettiest thing that you ever seen 
Hold up, wait, stop 
Wanna take her picture, you aint gonna get it for free 
You got what it takes to get down 
Lil mama way she work she breakin it to the ground 
Strokin around her body hypnotics to the sound 
Can nobody get her but me 

Can't nobody get her but me
