I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
Like Imma transformer, like Imma transformer, 

Smoke grey enzo looking like a shadow, 
550 Benzo you ain't on my level. 
Shawty gotta body cone shaped like a bottle, 
Magazine star dating nothing but the models, 

I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, (You bastards, bastards) 
I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
Like Imma transformer, like Imma transformer, 

Smoke grey enzo looking like a shadow, 
550 Benzo you ain't on my level. 
Shawty gotta body cone shaped like a bottle, 
Magazine star dating nothing but the models, 

Money piling up you would think I won the Lotto, 
Cash rule everything around me thats my motto, 
All black Rolex you had never seen no, 
Coutnin big chips you can call me a casino, 

Hey you, shawty what it do, 
Whip so sick you can call it bird flu, 
Got the top back hair blowing in the air, 
Imma bout to kill it this year, 

Cuz I went from a hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a, 
hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a, 
hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a, 
Like Imma transformer, like Imma transformer, 

Point black I'm the best in general, 
You know I ball and I ain't talkin bout genitals, 
Imma shark you can't catch me with no fishing pole, 
In the dark you can see me cos my whislte glow, 
Get some stripes lil' mama make my whislte blow, 
Don't need no misltetoe, but you can kiss it though, 
But baby drop it low and make it shake for me, 
Call me fellow of reserve cuz I make money, 

And then I waste money, 
My chain so sunny, 
I got them carrots so I share it with them snow bunnies, 
Yo money is only bout yay high, 
I got that ching ching money like shanghai, 
Yea Imma fool wit it, 
Know what to do wit it, 
Who you know got a private jet with the windows tinted, 
Overseas cash, 
Get overseas ass, 
got it on lock like I`m dreading with some beeswax, 

Hey you shawty what it do, 
Whip so sick you can call it bird flu, 
Got the top back hair blowing in the air, 
Imma bout to kill it this year, 

Cos I went from a, high top to a convertible like Imma transformer 
I went from a, 
hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, (Whoa) 
I went from a, 
hightop to a convertible like Imma transformer, 
I went from a, 
Like Imma transformer, like Imma transformer, (Yeea) 

Hey lil`mama pretty thang over there, 
Put my CD on and let it bang through ya ear, 
You know I`m the best, 
Watch me do my step, 
And Imma let you do the rest, 
Cos I got dimes on me, 
And I ain`t talking bout no weed, 
I mean fine shawtys, 
And they running with CB yea.
