[Verse 1:]
Aye baby
I don't like the way you got me feelin' lately, oh
They say baby
I'm feelin' like you found someone to replace me, oh
Do you remember,
You used to say that you would never walk away
'Cause I remember the time and the place
Like it was just yesterday
Baby had me (gone, gone, gone)
But you won't have me (I'm gone, gone, gone)
Say no more 'cause I know what you came for
Just wanna play them games, girl

[Chorus:]
It's so hard, (it's so hard, baby)
To be let down (to be let down, baby)
Tell me you won't do this to me (nah, nah, nah)
We've come too far (we've come too far, baby)
To give up now (to give up now, baby)
Girl that's just the way it should be
Say it with me, babe
Say it with me
Say it with me, babe
Say it with me
Say it with me, babe
Say it with me
Say it with me, babe
Say it with me

[Verse 2:]
Hey baby
Yeah you're crazy
But you ain't that crazy about me
Cause you think that you can get whatever you want
So you lie and you try to play me
Say lady, you're cold,
You're poison to me
And I know
Do you remember, you used to say that you would never walk away
Cause I remember the time and the place
Like it was just yesterday
Baby had me (gone, gone, gone)
But you won't have me (I'm gone, gon, e gone)
Say no more cause I know what you came for
Just wanna play them games, girl

[Chorus:]
It's so hard, (it's so hard, baby)
To be let down (to be let down, baby)
Tell me you won't do this to me (nah, nah, nah)
We've come too far (we've come too far, baby)
To give up now (to give up now, baby)
Girl that's just the way it should be
Say it with me, babe (hey baby)
Say it with me (please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, babe (tell the DJ keep this party goin')
Say it with me (hooray, hooray)
Say it with me, babe (hey baby)
Say it with me (please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, baby (tell the DJ keep this party rockin', hooray, hooray)

Hey baby please don't take my love away
Tell the Dj keep this party goin'
Hooray, Hooray
Hey baby please don't take my love away
Tell the Dj keep this party rockin'
Hooray, hooray
