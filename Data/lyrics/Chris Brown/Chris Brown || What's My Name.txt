Yeah, id like to introduce to you the future,
The young , the new R&B prince, Chris Brown
Spit flame, And me stick around ya boy Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris]
Have you ever seen a 4 door machine
when them things swing open (girl picture that)
Have you ever traveled upon a yacht
Sail across the ocean (girl picture that)
Tell me have you ever seen the stars
Shoot across the nite sky from a G4 side
Can u picture it?
Matter fact picture you and me living it.

[Hook]
I know I'm just a youngin'
But girl I'm in a good groove, right zone
I just need a year or two.
Let me stack this paper, imam keep the lights on
Let me show u what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool with it
So much diamonds you wont know what to do with it
(What’s my name?)
The name Chris Brown from Virginia
Ask about me and they'll tell you I'm the truth with it

[Chorus]
C to the H to the R.I.S.
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn’t know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on & on & on & on
C to the H to the R.I.S.
I know you like it baby just say yes
And if you didn’t know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on & on & on & on

[Verse 2:]
I know I might sound a little out there but
The south of France, I'm tryna keep you out there girl,
Take my hand and we can walk up out there with,
brand new bags. Now tell me how does that sound girl?
It's crazy how I'm feelin you
Damn I gotta get you to see-LOVE
Girl ya style is so sensual
Slide ya number and just roll with me

[Hook]
I know I'm just a youngin'
But girl I'm in a good groove, right zone
I just need a year or two.
Let me stack this paper, imam keep the lights on
Let me show u what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool with it
So much diamonds you wont know what to do with it
(What’s my name?)
The name Chris Brown from Virginia
Ask about me and they'll tell you I'm the truth with it

[Chorus]
C to the H to the R.I.S.

[Noah]
Yo money, money, money everywhere I go
Baby I'm a cash boy, so where's my dough (Ka-ching)
Girl I know when you hear my flow
Plus all the honies love it when I wear my fro
Lil mama I'm Noah the charmer
Better known as that boy Chevy impala
Shawty we can creep when u in ya pajamas
Then we can sip margaritas in the Bahamas
Amiga, Amiga lets flee to Aruba
We can ride now I got the keys to the cruiser
You can be with me, ain't got to be with a loser
Do what it do let me see if I'm a loser

What’s my name?

[Chorus]
C to the H to the R.I.S.
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn’t know now you know

C to the H to the R.I.S.
I know you like it baby just say yes
And if you didn’t know now you know
I'm a pro and I can go on & on & on & on

It’s Chris Brown.
Ma you need to stop playing
You know who you want.
You know what you need
And I do to.
