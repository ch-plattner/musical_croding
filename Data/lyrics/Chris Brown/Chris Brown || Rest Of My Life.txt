
Baby, love is gettin cold, hold me
My hands down, soak sheet, [?]

Might have to go away tonight,
Cause I gotta feelin my days are numbered
This might be the day

[Chorus:]
I close my eyes for eternal sleep
No more wakin up to Sunday morning now
Live to learn, learned a lot
Tonight I'm clocking out
This is my last kiss
My last wish
My last chance
My last dance
My last gift to give you
My love
It's the last time I'm holding you
Rest of my life with you tonight
Spendin rest of my life with you tonight
Spendin rest of my life with you tonight
Spendin rest of my life with you
My life with you

[Chris Brown:]
Wanna closin in yeahh
Wonderin when I see you again
And you lie, you wonder why
So this time I won't be right back
But I'll be your shining star
A memory in your arms

[Chorus x2]
