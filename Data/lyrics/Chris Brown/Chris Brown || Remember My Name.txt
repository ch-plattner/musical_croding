[Verse 1:]
I need your touch,
But your hands are locked away
I hear your voice,
You've got nothing left to say
I'll take this scar
Off my heart
I'll take this bullet,
I'll take it for love

[Pre-Chorus:]
So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd
But, will you remember me

[Chorus:]
Will you remember my name,
Remember my name,
Will you remember my name
Remember my
Name
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
Name
(I love you, I love you, love you)
Remember my
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
Name

[Verse 2:]
I need my kiss,
But your lips are far away
So I have no choice,
So I guess I'll
Have to steal your love away
And I'll take this scar
From my heart,
Bang bang,
I take this bullet,
Bang bang
I'll take it for love
Bang bang,
I'll take it for love,
Bang bang,
I'll take it for us

[Chorus:]
Will you remember my name,
(My name, my name)
Remember my name,
(My name, my name)
Will you remember my name
(My name, my name)
Oh, Remember my
Name
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
Name
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
(Remember my, remember my, remember my)
Remember my
Name

[Bridge:]
Floating above the clouds and sky
Wishing upon a falling star
Hoping my love hasn't forgot my name
It's automatic.
This attraction
This love is so strong
Two birds of a feather baby
Wishin' we can float off
We can fly,
Higher babe,
Higher babe, higher babe,
Higher babe, higher babe,
Just fly high
Higher babe, higher babe,
Higher babe, higher babe,
All gas no breaks
I just wanna levitate
All gas no breaks,
I just wanna levitate
All gas no breaks
I just wanna levitate
Just wanna levitate,
I just wanna levitate

[Chorus:]
Will you remember my name,
Remember my name,
Will you remember my name,
Remember my
Name,
Remember my
Remember my
Name,
Remember my
Remember my
Name
