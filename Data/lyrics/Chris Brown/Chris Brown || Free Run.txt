
Broken again
I’m down on my knees ripped apart
But I see you out there
So I’m taking these chains off my heart

I’m listening close for you
Feeling my way out the dark
I’m on my way to you
And won't nothing keep me from you

So I’ll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, I’ll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

Life with you leaving,
Is like being locked upside down
I’m all out of reasons to let
All this hurt keep me bound

I’ll listen close for you
I don’t wanna miss the good parts
I’m on my way to you
And wont nothing keep me from you

So I’ll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, I’ll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

So I’ll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right by your side, oh
Whoa, whoa, I’ll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you
