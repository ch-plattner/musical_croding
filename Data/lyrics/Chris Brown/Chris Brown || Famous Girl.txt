[Verse 1:]
Ye would've said you're "So Amazing"
So how could you be so "Heartless" girl
"Live Your Live", take T-I-M-E
"Day 'N' Night" just like KiD CuDi
You'll think of me (You will, oh)

Drake would say that you're the "Best He Ever Had"
Rumors come and go
But you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go it follows
Can't understand; I still you (Watch the blogs talk about this one)

[Chorus:]
Soon as I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down (Down, Down)
'Cause you're famous girl
For breaking hearts 

You're famous girl (girl) 
Girl (Girl) 
Girl (Girl) 
[x3]

Should've known you'd break my heart (That you would break my heart)
Heart (Heart)
Heart (Heart)

[Verse 2:]
Keri would've said my love "Knocks Her Down"
Keyshia would've told me I was "Sent From Heaven" 
Sorry B I don't wear no "Halo" 
You were first to play the game though 
Sorry I "Bust the windows out your car" 

I might have cheated in the beginning 
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia" 
But I meant it in "Forever"
We were supposed to be together 
And I can't let you go 

[Chorus:]
Since you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me 
Like damn I let you down (Down, Down)
Yes I'm famous girl
For breaking hearts 

I'm famous girl (girl) 
Girl (girl) 
Girl (girl)
[x3]

Didn't know I'd break your heart [x2] (That I would break your heart)

[x2]

[Hook:]
Many hearts we should've left unbroken 
Empty words are better left unspoken 
Too much pressure I wish time was frozen 
Seems we lost our way now
I hope your happy being famous girl 

[Chorus:]
You famous girl (Girl)
Girl (Girl)
Girl (Girl)
[x3]

Should've known you'd break my heart (Heart) 
Heart (Heart) 
Heart (Heart)
[x3]
