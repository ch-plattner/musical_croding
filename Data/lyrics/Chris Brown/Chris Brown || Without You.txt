
If you had a choice
Then what would you chose, to do?

I could live without money
I could live without the fame
And if everyday was sunny
I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to heaven
I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living
Because you're the one I couldn't live without

If I couldn't blink
Would I still be able to see you
I couldn't imagine
Without arms could I reach
No way could I ever hold you

I need these things
Like I need you
If you had a choice
What would you chose
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
And if everyday was sunny
I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to heaven
I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living
Because you're the one I couldn't live without

If I couldn't dream
Would I believe that there could be a you and me
And if I couldn't sing
Would you be able to hear my melody
And know that something's wrong
And I'm afraid that you're moving on
How can I fly when you're my wings

I need these things
Like I need you
If you had a choice
What would you chose
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
And if everyday was sunny
I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to heaven
I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living
Because you're the one I couldn't live without

You can take it all from me
And it wouldn't mean anything
Turn the whole world against me
As long as you don't leave
It's getting hard for me to sleep
Even harder for me to breathe
I'm used to life with you
Tell me what I need to do

I could live without money
I could live without the fame
And if everyday was sunny
I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to heaven
I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living
Because you're the one I couldn't live without

I could live without money
I could live without the fame
And if everyday was sunny
I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to heaven
I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living
Because you're the one I couldn't live without
