
I should've been a better man
Instead of wasting time spending my life searching for the finer things
You always gave me another chance to make it right
But I didn't deserve, cause I didn't understand

And I feel so bad
Cause you wouldn't do the same to me
But I know what your weakness is
And you feel so mad
And now you’re on an open road
So gone, not looking back

I thought I had you on a leash
Like I could do whatever I wanted to, and I wanted to, and you was gonna wait for me baby, no
And now the table has turned now I feel like you're the master and I'm on the strings
You're in control of me

And I feel so bad
And now you're doing it to me
Cause you know what my weakness is
And you feel so mad
And now I'm on an open road
Tryna go, but I'm looking back

I'm looking for her
I'm tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

I'm looking for her
I'm tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

You can blame it all on me
I know it’s like this because of me
Now I’m just like a hitchhiker waiting for a ride
With no cars in sight

And it feels so bad
Cause you wouldn't do the same to me
'cause I know what your weakness is
And I feel so mad
And now you're on an open road
Long gone, I can't have you back

I'm looking for her
I'm tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

I wanna see her
I don't ever wanna leave ya
I wanna keep ya
I think I love her
