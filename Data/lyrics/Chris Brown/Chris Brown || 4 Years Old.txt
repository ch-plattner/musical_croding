[Verse 1:]
I got money
Everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need,
Need, need
Ain't it funny,
How I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

[Chorus:]
Feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
Cause I'm just running fast
Should be walking
Saying when I grow up
You gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

[Verse 2:]
I guess I was faking
Cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought
Of love
But it's taking
Too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
Cause I just keep running fast
Should be walking
Saying when I grow up
You gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

[Bridge:]
I'm so alone,
I feel so alone,
So alone in this world
Got everything I want

[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
Cause I just keep running fast
Should be walking
Saying when I grow up
You gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy
Whoahhh
