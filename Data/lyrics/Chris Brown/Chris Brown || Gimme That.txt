The dynamic duo.
[Spoken:]
Wow womp womp womp.....it's what your body sayin'.
Chris Brown is in the building.

[Verse 1:]
The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em dizzy.
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,
'cause you speaking that slang that I talk.
That sassy tempo with that walk,
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me.

[Chorus (x2):]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

[Verse 2:]
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you,
What ya body got a young boy ready to do.
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you,
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school.
I'm a HUSTLA! Trust my frame and age.
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page.
I can PICTURE! Us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name.

(CHRIS!)

[Chorus x2]

[Breakdown:]
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp
Girl you serious and I been watching you.
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp
This's what your body's saying
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp (yeahhhhh)
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp
This what your body's sayin (owwww)

[Chorus x2]
