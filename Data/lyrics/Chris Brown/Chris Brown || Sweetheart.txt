
Sweetheart,
When the sunlight's on your face, now.
Hope that fate can have it's way today
Sweetheart,
It's like I'm drifting on a star
Know you're in a rush and my love's on the way, ay, ay.

And I love that you are everything I want
And if you need anything from me
You can just ask me!
'Cause your touch does something to me, baby
'Cause you're my greatest gift,
I seal it with a kiss

And I just wanna tell you that you are sweetheart, is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful)
Sweetheart is what you are
Sweetheart!
Sweetheart!

If I could take all
The girls around the world
And put 'em in a room, oh ah.
None of them could compare to you.
And I put together all the pieces
The only thing that's missing
Is you, yeah, is you, yeah

And I love that you are everything I want
And if you need anything from me
You can just ask me!
'Cause your touch does something to me, baby
'Cause you're my greatest gift,
I seal it with a kiss

And I just wanna tell you that you are sweetheart, is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful)
Sweetheart is what you are (Oh-na-na) (Oh-na-na)
Sweetheart!
Sweetheart!

Band in your hair,
With the scent of your perfume, girl
Nothing compares
To you, to you babe!
And I'm in paradise
You look so good in my eyes!
And I have her eyes right in front of me
You not, you not
But you are the real thing
Hands up
For your love
If you really really love somebody
Hands up
For your love
If you really really love somebody
I said put hands up, for your love
If you really really love somebody
Now I can see there's more to what you are

Baby, you are sweetheart, is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful)
Sweetheart is what you are
Sweetheart!
Sweetheart!

Band in your hair
With the scent of your perfume, girl
Nothing compares
To you, to you!
And I'm in paradise
You look so good in my eyes!
And I have her eyes right in front of me
You are the real thing!
