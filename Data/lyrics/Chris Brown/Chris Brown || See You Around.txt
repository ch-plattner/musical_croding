
You'd love another man
My heart is broken in two
She wears a ring on the other hand
She's scared to tell me the truth

But if you are leaving
I want you to know that
I shoulda loved you way more, way more
So, if this is the end of us now...
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts cause you don't love me

No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

No that you are comfortable
I think that I am losing my mind
It's crazy, cause we were so inseparable
Guess things change with time
Does he kiss and wipe away your tears
Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear
Oh, if I had a wishing well, I would have you right here

So, girl, if you are leaving
Baby, I want you to know that
I shoulda loved you way more, way more
So, if this is the end of us now...
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts cause you don't love me

No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

I didn't listen, you went missing
He has your heart now
I'm missing your kisses
Want it again
Don't leave me down

Wish I could keep you all to myself
I wanna work it out
But you moved on, I see it now
Oh, oh
Guess I'll see you around
