With the stars.

(Wanna be)
But people deny that pretty
Little thing they call Earth,
Needs me.

Wanna dance and make
Something from nothing,
Yeah, but so? (so?)
The rest of the world wanna
Either do good business,
Have glue without flow,

I'm here to show the world
That money don't buy
Happiness,
Believe me, I know. (I know)
But just one thing,
Wanna show the world,

And I've already changed my city,
Now I'm on my way to change the globe, (globe)
I'm traying to inspire the world to show
What you did when you hustle in your work,

Show'em what it is,
To put your life on the line
For the love of the crime,
Life is a rhyme with no reason,
And that's the reason I rhyme,
But once I show the globe,
I just wanna know.
