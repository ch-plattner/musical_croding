Ladies love me
I'm on my Cool J

[Chris Brown:]
My bad, I'm sorry
I'm double parked
Yeah that's my Bugatti
And that's my Ferrari next to my Ducati
Call my old school Big Bertha that big body
Boy I get exotic
My car need a pilot
Get free drinks to party
Your nigga need his wallet
No limit to what I'm spending so I know she's about bout it
And who in the hell is smoking in here 'cause it's super cloudy
Goons with me dressed like skaters
Getting bruised kidneys
Stretch you later
Man my house so big
Take the escalator to the elevator
Take the elevator to the private jet
Then I jet; niggas see you later

[Hook:]
Ladies love me
I'm on my Cool J
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin'
Ladies love me
I'm on my Cool J
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin'

[Justin Bieber:]
Baby I'm yo doctor,
I could be yo rocker,
Swaggin' I'm not braggin'
But I swear that I could rock ya'
Baby I'm not crazy,
I got swag like Patrick Swayze
Y'know them haters never phase me
That's not how my momma raised me
I am incredible, this is inedible
Killing this track was inevitable
I am hetero, baby you better know Jb is generally just a G look at me
Now, I said look at me, swagging with the crooked tee
Body slammed the beats from D Beat, call me
Call me Booker T.
I said whoa there, whoa there baby you just need to stop. (okay)
I'm busy out performing and I'm going to the top.
I got so much to lose, so I'm steady getting gwap.
But them haters go down and we just get to watch.
Amazing, I'm blazing. Look over here, said that I'm amazing.
Nobody's facing, what I'm facing. Set a pace, so I can race without pacing.
Lace my shoes off, start racing. You can taste it, without faste-ing,
I mean fasting, start blasting. Call up Lauren hill do-op that thing
Swagger jacking, is not what I do. JB is the man, yeah he's the truth.
He's a beast when he steps up in the booth. I just landed, I did too.
I'm a gentleman, yes I'm a gentleman, I'm out of my element, but I'm still elegant.
I'm full of adrenaline, you know what that means.
Louis V hightops with the skinny jeans.

Ladies love me

Ladies love me
