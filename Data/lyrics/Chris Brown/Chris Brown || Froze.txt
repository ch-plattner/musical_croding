[Verse 1:]
I've lost my temperature 
Where've all my sunny days gone 
Is there any place to stay warm 
It's not easy when your gone 
Tell me how I'm s'pose to go on 
Right now I don't be strong 

With the rain 
Comes more pain 
U never know (damn the weather) 
Hard to hide 
When I cry 
This pain inside (ain't ge'n better) 
Body shakes 
I feel so numb (nuuumb) 
I'm shiverin 
Why did you go 

[Chorus] 
My body is froze 
Every part of me cold 
My hearts achin 
And I can't breathe 
Souls breakin 
Minus 31 degreese 
Nowhere else to go 
Froze 

[Verse 2:]
My heart stuggles to beat yeah 
I need a life line 
And I would rather die 
Before I, start to freeze yeah 
Live my life in fear, no way 

With the rain 
Comes more pain 
U never know (damn the weather) 
Hard to hide 
When I cry 
This pain inside (ain't ge'n better) 
Body shakes 
I feel so numb (nuuumb) 
I'm shiverin 
Why did you go 

[Chorus] 
My body is froze 
Every part of me cold 
My hearts achin 
And I can't breathe 
Souls breakin 
Minus 31 degreese 
Nowhere else to go 
Froze 

[Bridge:]
I am so cold 
My body's frozen 
I am so cold 
Frozen 

Froze (my body is froze) 
[X8]

[Chorus] 
My body is froze 
Every part of me cold 
My hearts achin 
And I can't breathe 
Souls breakin 
Minus 31 degreese 
Nowhere else to go 
Froze 
[X2]
