[Soulja Rap:]
She bad, like a student in detention
Walk inside the club and my chain just glistenin
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em yeah I got Chris wit me
I bet I drank the bottle 'til that bitch empty
Gucci belt plus Louis when I hop up out my phantom
Turn my swag on, all the girls think I'm handsome
I maybe in my lambo or my jet, it doesn't matter
she bad, she bad, she bad, but she's badder

[Chris Verse:]
She lookin at me, I'm thinkin that she, that she bad than a mother
She staring at me, i'm thinkin that she, she a fine mothersucka
She a fine mothersucka, and I think I love her
Ooh I think she likes me, I'll keep her through the summer
Ride me like a wave, have you screamin cawabunga
Bubble bootylicious, make a nigga wanna pop her
Let me know just how you want it (oh oh oh oh)
Watch how quick i get up on it (oh oh oh oh)
Once I get up on yo body (oh oh oh oh)
Shawty I'ma keep it rockin

[Chorus 2x:]
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do

[Verse 2:]
She lookin at me, I'm thinking that she, that she bad than a mother
That juicy booty, got me thinkin, that's she the daughter of a trucker
She's the daughter of a trucker, booty like a mac truck
Pull up to her bumper, love the way she back it up
Say I got alot of talk, shawty I can back it up
When I put it on her, shawty just can't get enough
Let me know just how you want it (oh oh oh oh)
Watch how quick I get up on it (oh oh oh oh)
Once I get up on your body (oh oh oh oh)
Shawty I'ma keep it rockin

[Chorus 2x]

[Soulja Boy Rap:]
Man she so beautiful, she so super straight
In the club gettin dollars, yeah she gettin paid
She bad, she bad, she badder
Hop up in my jag my jag my jaguar
Pull up in my jag with the ice cream paint 
I need a $150,000 just to watch me blink
Baby girl fine and her outfit paint
Let's leave this club, heavy to my place
I'm like man she so beautiful, she so super straight
In the club gettin dollars, yeah she gettin paid
She bad, she bad, she badder
Hop up in my jag may jag my jaguar

[Chorus 2x]
