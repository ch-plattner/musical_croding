[Verse 1 - Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldn've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a truck
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head baby there's a picture
I Wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

[Diddy]
uh
Give my all you take it from me
And don't even replace it for me
I wish you just fake it for me
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks wit you I needed you
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missing something I wish I was what completed you

[Chorus]
She's like a drug
And I don't think I can get rid of her
Cuz she got me in this curse
And it dawned on me I can't do nothing with her
This woman's worth
I Can't find my way out
And it hurts
I tried but she won't let me go
Oh,Oh,oh,oh,oh she won't let me go
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

[Verse 2]
I feel like a killer hit me
The weapon was concealed initially
But I felt so much pain from it
You deserved to feel it with me more
I feel like I beg wit you I plead wit you
I don't comprehend how you can't love when its so easy to
I thought you could do it I believed in the naive in you
I just need to breathe baby now I got the freedom to
Damn?
