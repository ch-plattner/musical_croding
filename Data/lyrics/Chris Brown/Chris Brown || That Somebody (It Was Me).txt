[Verse 1]
Tell me do you remember when (hmmmmm)
You were talking to your best friend
And she mention
There was someone a gentleman (hmmmmm)
Who was trying his best to extended
An invitation

[Pre-chorus]
If you get to know me baby it will be
A really good thing
Baby no strings
I know it seems like
I’m coming on strong
I hope you don’t mind spending time
Just you and me (Just you and me)
I know you will have a good time

[Chorus]
That somebody was me
I’m the one that called you up with the blocked ID
For a week see I was holding back my feelings
Wasn’t sure how you would respond to me
It was me girl

[Verse 2]
Girl I bet you remember when (hmmmmm)
You went out with your girls clubbing
And dancing yeah
You glanced at a gentleman (hmmmmm)
I got your number from your girlfriends
They said you would want

[Pre-chorus]
If you get to know me baby
It will be a really good thing 
Baby no strings
I know it seems like 
I’m coming on strong
I hope you don’t mind spending time
Just you and me (Just you and me)
I know you will have a good time

[Chorus]
That somebody was me
I’m the one that called you up with the blocked ID
For a week see I was holding back my feelings
Wasn’t sure how you would respond to me
It was me girl

[Chorus]
That somebody was me
I’m the one that called you up with the blocked ID
For a week see I was holding back my feelings
Wasn’t sure how you would respond to me
It was me girl

[Bridge]
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Not ashamed to say it was me baby
Not ashamed to say it was me
I’m not ashamed 
They said

[Chorus Repeats (3x)]
That somebody was me
I’m the one that called you up with the blocked ID
For a week see I was holding back my feelings
Wasn’t sure how you would respond to me
It was me girl
