Damn, I want my baby back 
It's so cold without her 
Cold without her 
She's gone 
Now I'm alone, no one to hold on 
Cause she was the only one 
And I know I was dead wrong 
But if you you you 
If you you you 
See her sooonn 
Ask her will she forgive me 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
Then tell her it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Here without her 
And tell her I miss her 
Tell her I need her 
Tell her I want her 
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm 
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
Can you forgive me? 
Please forgive me 
And come back home, keep me safe and warm 

Now my baby's really gone 
I don't know if she's coming home 
My love's up, I fucked up 
I know 
Tell me what to do to get her back 
Back where her heart belongs, been gone from me too long 

So if you you u, seen my boo o o 
Please can you you you 
Can you tell her for me 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
Let her know it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Here without her 
And tell her I miss her 
Tell her I need her 
Tell her I want her 
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm 
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
Can you forgive me? 
Please forgive me 
And come back home, keep me safe and warm 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
Let her know it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Without her
