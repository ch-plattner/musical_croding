Uh oh [x4]
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
uh oh there she goes [x3]
Can't nobody get her but me

Hot damn let me tell you man
She looks so good I'm gonna say it again
So good that I can't explain
When she does what she does she's gonna do her thing
Over here Miss Lane
Come on, get fly with a Superman
You ain't got to worry I won't play no games
Baby tonight

[Hook:]
So don't front you know you wanna stay
It's all good so baby come and play

[Chorus:]
It's picture perfect the way you work it girl
What's your purpose? 'cause I deserve it girl
Before we get into it something crazy
all you fellows back up off my lady
Get you one 'cause I got that one [x4]
It's the way she wears her clothes
The beauty overload
The definition of a star
Wanna meet her?

You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
uh oh there she go [x3]
Can't nobody get her but me

Damn girl set my flame ablaze
Top model chick from my favorite page
At the same time form around the way
when she breaks it down she's gonna do her thing
After the beat drop you can hear the bass from the parking lot
You ain't got to worry you won't tell me stop
Baby tonight

So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun so baby come and play

[Chorus]

You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
uh oh there she go, uh oh there she go, uh oh there she go, uh oh there she go
Can't nobody get her but me

[Will.I.Am:]
Hot damn I got the hottest chick
She gotta be a goddess her body's sick
3-D booty like holy shit
She's holding them Angela Jolie lips
With the tig old bits
Willy get whipped when she wiggles it
She jiggles it, my stick gets stiff
Make a brother think she's a hypnotist
'cause she hypnotizes
Brother's gonna trip when she arrives
Looking like she fell out the sky
Heaven's missing an angel, guys gonna cry
'cause she's chilling with me
I am Willy in love with Double D cups
And she's that honey
Just need one I don't need many
She loves me never money or pennies
Look if you want brother you ain't getting any
That's mine yep yep that's right sonny
Get you one 'cause that's my honey

Get you one 'cause I got that one [x4]

It's the way she wears her clothes
The beauty overload
The definition of a star

Get you one 'cause I got that one [x4]
