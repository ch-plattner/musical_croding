[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It don't get no better
My tongue writing you letters
Feeling you get wetter
We'll be making love until the morning after
And I can feel your tide slowly rising
As I'm sipping from your water fountain
We gon' flood the bed, take it to the ground
While I'm in your ocean baby, hold my head down

[Hook: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Just take me under)
Drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl)
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
High heels and your red lips
It's Fahrenheit in here
And I can see a million ways
For me to surfboard between your waves
Baby going up down, all around
Drip drop, don't stop
No umbrella
Playing in your brain, shut it off
Splashing in your deep end
Hydrate me
Oh baby, come sit down right on my face

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby, baby, baby
(Yeah I wanna drown in it)
Baby, baby, baby
(Yeah, I wanna drown in it)
Take me under, babe
(Yeah, I wanna drown in it)
I just wanna tell you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
No price compares to what it's worth and
Your pool is like heaven on Earth
You screaming while I'm touching your spot
Oh girl, I got your water so hot
And I wanna drown in it
I wanna drown in it, babe
I wanna drown in it, baby
All you gotta do is -
Keep filling me up with your juices
Keep it right there baby, don't lose it

[Hook:]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Girl, just take me under)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl)
Drown in it, drown in it (Swim in your deep, babe)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (All up in your creek, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (And I'm not comin' up)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Gonna stay right there, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Gonna live in there, baby)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Right there under your water baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Just like a male mermaid, babe)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I won't ever come up, oh

[Outro: R. Kelly]
I stay thirsty, babe
Yeah
