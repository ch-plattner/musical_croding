
What you wanna do baby?
Where you wanna go?
I take you to the moon baby
I take you to the floor
I treat you like a real lady
No matter where you go
Just give me some time baby as you know

Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours 'til the night it's ours and I'll be back with you

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
(Five more hours we're just getting started)

How you wanna feel baby? What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink baby, come on pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady, I'll keep you out the cold
I'll give you all my time baby, you know

Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours 'til the night it's ours and I'll be back with you

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
(Five more hours we're just getting started)

I follow the sound of your heartbeat
How it always calls me, finding my way back to you
I'm feeling it more now than ever
I'll do this forever, just to spend a night with you

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just getting started
(Five more hours we're just getting started)
