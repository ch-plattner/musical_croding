[Chris Brown:]
It's time to celebrate like I just touched down
Know we getting ready to party
I'm a show you how
Yeah shit happens but tonight we don't care
I just wanna see you put your hands in the air and say

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]
Hey little mama all that ass in them pants
Drop it like you're single even though you got a man
Black and Puerto Rican with a Spanish accent
Hands on the floor dancing like we sexing

[Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the one you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]

[Sabrina Antoinette:]
Come for me right now
Won't be no hard
Hear my voice
Hear my body cry
Got the key to my heart
But it won't waste no night

[Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the one you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]

[Bridge:]
You wanna be bad tonight
Baby look at you
You gotta be bad enough
Oh yeah mama let me hear you say
I just wanna do some
Dirty little things to ya
I just wanna be your

[Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh [x2]
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the one you
