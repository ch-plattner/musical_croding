You're blowing up my phone, telling me to come over 
And you say 
You really need me to come closer babe and handle your body 
Girl I'm right here to hold you down 
Slow it down and speed it up 
And girl I want you to scream, baby come put your hair down for me 

[Hook] 
I know 
I know, every time I'm with her, every time I'm with, every time I'm with her she gone break me off 
I can't wait to get her, I can't wait to get 
I know when I get her I'mma break her off 
I just can't wait for you 
So baby, please I need it more and more 
Baby, one more time 
One more time 

Girl you know you the shit tonight, you gone get this d*ck tonight 
That's right 
Know you're mine 
And you can give me all of that lick tonight 
I'm kissing both of your lips tonight 
A nigga goin' harder, harder 
I know you a bad girl, and I need it 
And that lame nigga just beat it 
Two girls off the bed, that's two stains 
Versace, they body 
Fuck â€˜em with the rolie on & two chains 
Wait.. 

[Hook] 
I know 
I know, every time I'm with her, every time I'm with, every time I'm with her she gone break me off 
I can't wait to get her, I can't wait to get 
I know when I get her I'mma break her off 
I just can't wait for you 
So baby, please I need it more and more 
Baby, one more time 
One more time
