[Verse 1:]
The memories we shared
Could last a man a lifetime
It's like truth or dare,
When you're there.
And I'll admit that I'm scared
To lose you to another guy-uy-uy
But it's up to you to decide
Who to love.

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm a break my promise,
I know I said
I'll set you free
But baby you told me to be honest,
Girl I need you here with me
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Verse 2:]
A whole life time
Would not be enough
Cause I wanna love you baby
Over and over
And girl each time I
See you shed a tear
I wanna wipe 'em all up
With my kisses
And make you smile from ear to ear.

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm a break my promise,
I know I said
I'll set you free
But baby you told me to be honest,
Girl I need you here with me
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it agin

[Bridge:]
Girl what are you running from?
I'm willing just to give you everything you want
Girl you are always number one,
I'm saying 'cause I know you're more than wonderful
And my heart & your heart are as one,
And this love will never change
You
And me forever
Woah oh [x6]
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Woah oh [x6]
