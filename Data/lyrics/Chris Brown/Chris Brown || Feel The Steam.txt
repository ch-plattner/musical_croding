Burn it up
Before all the club is on fire
No top Bueno Bueno
Watching her perspire

Now why don't you make my temperature rise
And I could not do because it's not in your size
I told her she may go loop because she criticized
? 
Show me around town anytime you see me roll
Call me in the Benz anytime at wedding toll

Can you feel the steam?
Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me

Girl, let me make you body sweat
Come on come on make your body wet

Community mean all that foolishness

Don't make me leave you head, jump and twist
Come on I don't wanna hear you jump on this
If you don't hear me make you fall in the trap door
Hold on me forever and pop on the floor

Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me

If I know what she wants, I can reach for the stars

Before I go turn on her like a belly dancer
