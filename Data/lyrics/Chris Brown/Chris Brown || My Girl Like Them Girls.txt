
Let me start off by saying
Baby don't go both ways
She don't mind flirting and playing
At least that's what she say
Got off in the spot
And I'm tripping
She knows baby girl's first name
Could it be something I'm missing
Or am I just part of the game
Woah woah
She getting more change than the players
Woah woah
She putting fingers up to the haters
Woah woah
Way she do it it look so good
Like I said she don't go both ways
But this is making me wish she would

My girl like them girls
It's alright it's okay
My girl like them girls
It's alright it's okay
So I let her let her do her thing
I even let her make it rain
My girl like them girls
She like them girls
Oh yeah

Didn't know that she liked them girls
Didn't know she...

Number one fantasy on my list
I even did it once in my dream
Ooh that damn Minaj
Could it really be happening
Baby how you gon' tease me
Tucking dollars all between your thighs
Ooh that girl got it
You should make an exception tonight

Woah woah
She getting more change than the players
Woah woah
She putting fingers up to the haters
Woah woah
Way she do it it look so good
Like I said she don't go both ways
But this is making me wish she would
Yeah...

My girl like them girls
It's alright it's okay
My girl like them girls
It's alright it's okay
So I let her let her do her thing
I even let her make it rain
My girl like them girls
She like them girls
Oh yeah

Didn't know that she liked them girls

She liked the one with the tattooed thighs
I think they call her Sunshine
And if she wanna cross the light
I don't care
Cause ain't nobody gotta know
And we can keep it on the low
And if you wanna take her home
We can share...
