[intro:]
Yeah (on tonight)
It's like I can't let you go (on tonight)
But I got to (on tonight)
I'm a change it up a little bit, I'm a do it like this

[verse: Chris Brown]
We been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
Gotta ball player, but a nigga ain't tripping
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time,
steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
Yea you don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like
but I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm going get tipsy
Over twenty one,
all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[chorus:]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't going think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)

[verse: bow wow]
You got the wrong one, if you think I ain't gonna go out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I gotta couple of girls on call, I'm a bring em out
A magic city stripper, hunh, so this is what it's all about
I'm the club doing my two steps
I done pulled about eight broads already
I'm just getting my feet wet (damn)
But I ain't even knocking your style
See I be here all day tryna count how many girls want bow
Yeah, I see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look wack
If dude gotta problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah, that loud pack
Shit it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better cuff your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo

[chorus:]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't going think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)

[Chris Brown:]
Shawty, what's up?
I'm bad (bad)
All the girls in the club
(got damn, you're sexy)
You sexy,
got damn, you're sexy
Oh you're sexy, oh

[chorus:]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't going think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
