You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city, girl)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(I be riding through the city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh my niggas don't play)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city, yeah)
You know I be riding round the town and down the block
(Just rolling through my city)
I'm in my hood all day (I'm in my hood)
It's the gangsta way
You know my way (You know my way)
Them boys don't play (Oh my niggas don't play)

[French Montana:]
Niggas said Hollywood, a nigga done made it
If I don't make it, I'mma call her on FaceTime, she gon' go crazy
I just want her ass up, face down, yelling out "Baby"
Repping for my city, know they miss me, it's been a while, money ain't change me
Whip it then we flip it, head up North Street
Fuck what it cost, European whips, we be flossing
Limp when I walk, you fucking with a boss
Oh I'm, you know

[Hook]

Girl you know I'll never leave
You know my heart is in these streets
And that ghetto love ain't changing
I'mma put on for my city, that's that Virginia in me
It's a big world for a little country boy, yeah yeah
Now everybody knows my name
Baby I'm coming home
Country nigga ain't change

[Hook]
