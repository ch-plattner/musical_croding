Bet he be treatin' you rude always got an attitude
Like he's the only dude made for you, woah

[Pre-Chorus:]
But I bet he didn't count on, a little nigga like me comin' round
(Giving you things to think about cause I know whats up)
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
(Cause he ain't worth your love)

[Chorus:]
Stop tripping,
I know you got a man but girl he's slipping
I can see myself gettin' in where I fit in
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me cause
He ain't fly, He don't even drive
Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night baby I'm your guy
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please your man, your man ain't me

[Verse 2:]
Girl, I know that you be wishin' he was nothin' like
Like that playa type, and you so lucky to be with him
Wish that he treated you cool and didn't cheat on you
Like your just another girl in his crew, woah
