[Verse 1:]
Your place mid-night 
When I come through I ring ya doorbell twice 
When I come through I do the things you like
Like I'm room service and dont you 
Take me but every chick tryna 
Take all yo shit coz I aint even 
Tryna get none of yo shit please 
I dont want none of your  

[Chorus:]
Dont be star struck 
When we goin under these covers 
You can have the key to my hand cuffs 
Man up boy just play along 
I'll give it to you proper 
Play nurse and you play doctor 
Boy you know I got ya (hah) 
I know what you like 

You like the way I shine 
And I'm 10 times part of a dime 

Im your golden girl (golden girl) 
Your golden girl (golden girl) 

I've got my shit together even with 
A chick get a grip with hips like this 

My golden girl (golden girl) 
My golden girl (golden girl)

[Verse 2:]
Freeze, you aint ever had a girl like me 
If you think that I'm lying test 
Me, and you'll see that I'm 
Down on that anger please 
Im gonna show you how to break it down 
Youve been given none of my love 
To you so dont be star struck 

[Chorus 2x:]
Dont be star struck 
When we goin under these covers 
You can have the key to my hand cuffs 
Man up boy just playin along 
I'll give it to you proper 
Play nurse and you play doctor 
Boy you know I got ya (hah) 
I know what you like 

You like the way I shine 
And I'm 10 times part of a dime 

I'm your golden girl (golden girl) 
Your golden girl (golden girl) 

I've got my shit together even with 
A chick get a grip with hips like this 

My golden girl (golden girl) 
My golden girl (golden girl) 

You like the way I shine 
And I'm 10 times part of a dime 

I'm your my golden girl (golden girl) 
Your golden girl (golden girl)

A chick get a grip with hips like this
