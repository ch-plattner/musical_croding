[Verse 1]
I'm finally fed up,
With the run around chase and cut,
So I hung my jersey up, turned in my playas card,
um...the boy faced the facts, I'm a man now, 
done with that, finally learned how to act, 
and in fact it’s cuz of who you are
So glad that I found you

[Chorus:]
So glad, so glad (So glad)
So glad, so glad (I found you) So glad (Baby, so glad that I found you)
So glad, so glad (You made me) So glad, so glad (Brand new, yeah) So glad, 
baby I'm so glad that I found you

[Verse 2:]
Hey, you caught me up,
When I stop, u start me up,When a brotha got low, got me up,
And I’d be up, stu-stu-stuck girl (girl hook me up) 
And not to be cliche (cliche),
But I'm inclined to your body (body) My good day, (hey) just the way you do
Makes me so damn glad that I found you

[Chorus:]
So glad, so glad (So glad)
So glad, so glad (I found you)
So glad (Baby, so glad that I found you)
So glad, so glad (You made me) So glad, so glad (Brand new) So glad, 
baby I'm so glad that I found you

[Bridge:]
I love the way that you care for me honey,
I love the fact that you’re there for me honey,
And I ain’t goin nowhere from you, trust me
(Now that I got you baby)
I love the way that you care for me honey,
I love the fact that you’re there for me honey,
And I ain’t goin nowhere from you, trust me
(Now that I’ve found you, baby)

[Chorus:]
So glad, so glad, so glad, so glad (I’m So Glad) So glad 
(Oh, I’m So Glad)So glad, so glad so glad, so glad 
(Now That I’ve Found U, I’m Brand New) So glad, 
baby I'm so glad that I found you so glad, so glad 
(I’m So Glad I’ve Found Her, I’m So Glad I Got U)
So glad, so glad so Glad (I’m so Gla-a-ad) So glad, so glad (Baby, eh, Baby)
So glad,so glad so glad, baby I'm so glad that I found you
