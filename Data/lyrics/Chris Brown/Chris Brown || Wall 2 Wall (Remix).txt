Ladies
I'm going to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies
You are not listening
I'm going to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown

I'm Back
(Pull up Pull up) Can't believe the girls, club packed)
(What up What up) Shawty wanna lead me to the back (to the back)
Ain't been in here 15 minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
(Hold up Hold up) Now lil mama wanna get mad
(Slow up Slow up) Sayin she don't wanna share what she have (she have)
Ain't no particular one that's gettin the water gun
So many that I want

[Chorus:]
They acked up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nuthin but ladies callin
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep commin from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nuthin but ladies callin
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep commin from wall to wall

Another two just came and said they love me on the radio
Two twins, that's the coolest scenerio
They talkin leavin right now
Wanna put in some time cause you know what they are ready for
(One Talkin) Oh she like the way that I pop
(And The Other One) Said she wanna just watch
I'm game for any damn thang, but there's more than 200 dames
That swear they could go

[Chorus]

[Chorus: spoken with ad libs]

So many look good in here
I just don't know which one I want
If I had to choose ya'll know
I would take all ya'll with me
Who wanna try me on the floor
Who ready to come and get this
All I know I'm feelin this party
And you can see I'm so ready

[Chorus: with ad libs]

[Chorus: spoken with ad libs]

Yea smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yea smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yea smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yea smash on the radio, bet I penned it
