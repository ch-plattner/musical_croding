
You look, so good
I can't, believe it
I'm out (my), my mind (mind)
I shouldn't be but (oh)
Women like you steal my control
Scene of the crime
My spot is next door
Come on (girl)
Girl don't (girl don't) be scared (be scared)
Now baby

[Chorus:]
Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me help me help me
I can't stop myself
You effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming
Love you roughly
I need a little bit of help
Keep raising the body count
When ever I take em out
I end up taking em down
Can you help me,help me, help me?
Shoot me or something
Help me, help me, help me
Do me or something
I need help

We're here, (so) alone (good)
I got, a problem
I'm out (my) my mind (mind)
Over your body
(Shouldn't be but oh)
Women like you steal my control
Scene of the crime
My spot is next door
Come on girl (girl)
Girl don't (girl don't) be scared (be scared) now baby
help me help me help me
I want you to help me
help me help me
I can't stop myself
You effing lovely
Wanna have you screaming love you roughly
I need a little bit of help
Keep raisin the body count
When ever I take em out I end up taking em down
Can you help me help me help me
Shoot me or somethin
Help me help me help me
Do me or somethin
I need help

Won't you help me 'cause I can't leave it alone
I can't stop it
'cause everytime I get it alone
I gotta pop it
It's like that I be feeling too grown
I'm fein'in I be club hopping
Tryna get something popping
And I
When I get her alone
Already knowing I'm on it
I ain't tryna be good
So I'm gonna let you know
Its like woah
I need help tryna get this some control

[Chorus x2]
