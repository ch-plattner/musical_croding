[Talking] Yeaa...Yu know being from Virginia
(ha ha) I gotta go back to my roots
the whole Go-Go thang... DC what's up?
(ha ha) Virginia you already know how we about to do it
Let's go...Yessir

Been sitting here for an hour talking
But we ain't saying nothing
I ain't even tripping mama that's cool
No better way to waste time then to with you
Ain't that a trip 'cause usually I do my thing and I dip (oh)
But she got me wanna stick around for the second show
Have her do her thing on the stage for me once more
And in like....Oh

[Chorus:]
I can't wait for us to be alone (tell me)
So tell me, tell me what you say ma
You've been keeping it 100 up to this far
So what you wanna do
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool (for you)
'cause shorty got me throwed
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown (ayy)
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown (ayy)

Now I can't say all the things I wanna say
(But your body is a problem for me)
And I put shame on a man that walked away
(But I'm glad he left you here for me yeah)
That's real 'cause usually I can't express how I feel
It's like I'm in my favorite scenes on a movie screen
Diamond studded Tee, Crown holding my Spike Lee's
and I'm like whoa...

[Chorus]

[x2]
Girl you got that knock, I hear it down the block
And if I get a chance, guaranteed I keep it hot
I gotta get you locked, so baby pick you feet up
Adjust my two seater, holla if you hear me now

Ooo...

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Yessir...two up, two down
Holla at me...it's all about you
We're out..let's go
Gotta me feeling like...hey hey hey
