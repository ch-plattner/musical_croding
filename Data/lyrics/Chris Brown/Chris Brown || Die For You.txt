
Murder, murder she wrote
My blood spills all over the pages
And my last breath is a crawl
I say that I love you
My dying wish, you can, you hold me close?

I'm going six feet underground
Where you left me
I'm going deep hope I don't drown
Cause you're where, babe
Do you a stone cold killer
I'm a need a body bag (you pulling on my zipper)

Now I'm floating to the other side
Before the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down
Now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby you have the gun
And you pulled the trigger
One shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side
For you I do or die

I drink, I smoke, I fly, I die for you [x4]

Baby don't hold back, don't hold back
It's your chance,
If you can, let you take my life away
It's my life in your hands
Girl, I need mouth to mouth
Baby, I need CPR

I'm going six feet underground
Where you left me
I'm going deep hope I don't drown
Cause you're where, baby
Do you a stone cold killer
I'm a need a body bag (pulling on my zipper)

Now I'm floating to the other side
Before the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down
Now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby you have the gun
And you pulled the trigger
One shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side
For you I do or die

I drink, I smoke, I fly, I die for you [x4]

Hold on, heavenly father
Let me get back to my lover
I wanna hold on
I die if you wanna leave, girl
I want to stay here, 'till the end of life (until for me)
Girl I wanna let the love, let the love
Deep in the clouds tryin' to get her down

Now I'm floating to the other side
Before the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down
Now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby you have the gun
And you pulled the trigger
One shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side
For you I do or die

I drink, I smoke, I fly, I die for you [x4]
