Chi town down to VA, step walk out them PJ's
Pockets smell like feme's so I fed them cheesecake
She wanna know how these taste, she gave me the please face
I gave her the leave face, she know what I think like Gene Grey
Stepped on in so cleanly, mastermind in yeezy
Your diamonds ain't got no class, we call them Dr. King Day
Our watches got them scholarships, with knowledge that
She fine yo, but we don't want your baby girl, we will take
Your shine though.
