Young love, love love.
A teenage love.
Young love.
A teenage love.
Young love, young love, everything I need, I got my young love.
Young love.
A teenage love

Tell me what's the definition of love.
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but everytime they fall up in it,
They fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us, telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done, I know that we can do it

'Cause it's wilding out (we got that)
Forgiving (we got that)
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling (we got that)
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then (we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

It's crazy how all our friends say, that we gone, they still tryna figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together, and we don't gotta front, we ain't pretend, girl
And you know a couple of them gone hate, talk behind your back, smile up in your face

Girl we can prove 'em wrong show 'em how it's done and girl I know we can do it because

'cause if it's wilding out (we got that)
Then forgiven
If it's talking bout how we feeling (we got that)
Just hanging out, keeping it real then (we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love

We can hit a show, kick it on the block, everywhere we go, we know that we got that young love, young love, young love
Just talking on the phone, laying at the spot, no matter what we do, they know they can't stop that young love, young love, young love
(you're my young love baby)

Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love

Young love, young love everything I need I got my young love (young love)
Young love, young love everything I want I got in my young love
