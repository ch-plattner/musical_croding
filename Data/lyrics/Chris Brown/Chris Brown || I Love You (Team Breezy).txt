[Verse 1]
I know everybody on
This planet wished that they had you
I feel so blessed baby
Itâ€™s an honor to know I got you
I know every man
Probably told you that he loved you
This ain't no ordinary love song
No this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'mma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem
Say it from a mountain top
Sing it like a favorite song
I'mma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
Cause I love you oh
And baby there's nothing in the world
That I won't do for you
Oh I love you oh
I gotta tell you about a million trillion times
Baby you're the best thing in my life

[Verse 2]
Put your hand on my heart
Can't you feel that boom boom boom?
Only one reason that it beats is for you
But in this love game baby I play the fool
But this is no ordinary love song
No this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'mma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem
Say it from a mountain top
Sing it like a favorite song
I'mma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
Cause I love you oh
And baby there's nothing in the world
That I won't do for you
Oh I love you oh

I gotta tell you about a million trillion times
Baby you're the best thing in my life

[Bridge]
For once in my life
Once in my life
I can see clear
Cause you open my eyes
For once in my life
Once in my life
No doubt in my mind
You're the only one for me
Baby can't you see? Oh oh, oh oh...
I'm so oh...in love

[Chorus]
Cause I love you oh
And baby there's nothing in the world
That I won't do for you
Oh I love you oh
I gotta tell you about a million trillion times
Baby you're the best thing in my life
