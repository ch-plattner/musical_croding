[Verse 1:]
Now every girl I've been with (been with) after you
Baby it just ain't the same (no-no, no-no, no-no)
Recently I had a girl and her name was Nikki
But she left me cause I called your name (no-no no-no)
I been on that rebound tip
I can't believe that you got me feeling like this
And every other morning it's your face that I miss
Man ya boy's sick
Cause shawty was a 10
But I was on that bull when I was with you

[Chorus:]
You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you
Girl when I was with you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you
Girl with you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you
Girl when I was with you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you (you) you

[Verse 2:]
And every other phone call it's one of (one of my dawgs)
Man I just seen Keisha and Nikki and them up in the mall
So what did she have on?
Gucci jeans, BeBe tee air force ones hair all done
Damn, man please don't tell me no more
Man my heart is so sore
I wanna reclaim her
But she'll never get over what I put you through
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Man my momma loved you
It's my fault I wasn't true
But I was on that shh when I was with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Girl I know it's way to late
To even say "I'm sorry babe"
I wanna pick up up the phone
But inside my heart I know I'm wrong
And I still wanna be ya man
But I thought it through time and time again
This road that I'm traveling on
Will leave me lost and alone
When I... (when I was with you)

[Chorus]
