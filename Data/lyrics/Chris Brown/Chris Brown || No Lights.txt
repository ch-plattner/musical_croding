So we can move right to the rhythm of love
Ooh that dress is so fancy, yeah
And girl I hope you don't mine taking it off
(Take it off now girl)

Don't rest right tonight gotta place in my reserve for two
(Show you right)
Girl, no need to run from me
Cause every night could change your life I promise you
Don't be afraid of the dark baby
Just look at the disco ball

We don't need no lights
Ooh girl join me
We can get it till 4, 5, 6 in the morning
You gon' feel alright
You dancing, extra horny
You dancing like you drunk
Like you drunk

Put your hands to the ceiling
I want you to feel it all night long
I'm a rock your body back and forth
I'm committed, to make you my business
And I'll be rocking all night long

Don't rest right tonight gotta place in my reserve for two
(Show you right)
Girl, no need to run from me
Cause every night could change your life I promise you

It ain't no one else in this room but me and you
And baby if you ready, I'll take you if you let me
And we gon' have a hell of a night
And you gon' have the time of your life

Ohh baby, let's get crazy
Let's get faded
