If I gotta guess it I will
I think it's 310-143-1437
Baby if I press it then will I get to you?
Let me know, what is your number girl?

Every minute is worth a dime of spending
You can change my whole life if you fit it
Odds are, one in a billion
My heart, I bet on you if I just get your number

Girl if I put your number in my phone
I hope that it's the right one
Girl If I did then
I'm gonna win it tonight hon
It could mean a lot for me
I think I done hit the lottery, baby yeah
Think I hit the lottery, baby yeah

Get on this investment cause if you bet on me
Then we can go anywhere in love it's nothing
If I leave a message I hope that it goes through
Let me know, if I'm the one girl

Every minute is worth a dime of spending
You can change my whole life if you fit it
Odds are, one in a billion
My heart, I bet on you if I just get your number

Girl if I put your number in my phone
I hope that it's the right one
Girl If I did then

Think I hit the lottery, baby yeah
