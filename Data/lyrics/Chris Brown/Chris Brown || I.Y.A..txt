
I was crazy when I said I didn't love you, 
From the first time that I ever saw you, 
The emotions running deep underneath my skin, 
Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin.

So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.

I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms.

Ohhohoh [x4]

If my heart is outa place move over, 
I coulda told you how it hurts, coulda told ya.
& now I want you I can feel it in my heartbeat, 
It's like a race like I'm running in a track meet.

So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.

I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms, 
I wanna wake up in your arms.

Ohhohoh [x4]
