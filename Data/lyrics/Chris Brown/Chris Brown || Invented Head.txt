
Soon as I walked in the room she was on me
Like nigga take them clothes off and put it on me
So Im about to go hard for real
Let me throw your ass on the bed peel
Your pants, your shirt, panties and your bra
Right off of your body, Ima put you on the wall
Who you gonna call when you need the deal
You already know Ima freak in the sheets.

[Chorus:]
When I get you to the crib (back to the crib)
Upstairs in the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gon think [4x]
That Ima champion (Ima winner)
I know how to get it done (hell yeah)
Girl you gon think
Girl you gon think
Ima make you think
You gon think
You gon think
You gon think I invented head

I be havin you singin like opera
Put that soprano on your tone like Opera.
I use my tongue yea Ima cookie monster
You an amazon so can you take this anaconda
This the shit so I had to get it on this
Not even 21 but Im already on that grown shit
So can I lick it, lick it, lick it
Why you think we in the kitchen

[Chorus]

Yeah when I kiss you
Yeah when I lick you
It's like na na na na nana
It's like na na na na nana
Baby yeah when I touch you
