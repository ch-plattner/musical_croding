Girl I know when we fussin' every little thing I say ain't right
Now, you callin' me names and I see the pain that's in your eyes
Then we be makin' love all around then I got my body in between your thighs
Oh, baby, I like it when we make up

[Chorus:]
Keep it up
Keep it goin'
Cause you're fine
And you know it
I love it when you talk that shit
I love it when you talk that shit
Yell it loud
So I can hear it
Cuss me out
Make me feel it
I love it when you talk that shit
I love it when you talk that shit

God dammit I just like everything you do cause I know you keep me in check
And if a girl try to push up on me you won't hesitate to grab her by her neck
A little crazy but you're amazing
You ain't scared to show your bad side
Oh, baby
You're the one I want
One I love

[Chorus]

Tell me shut up, tell me no
You get better if I let you throw my phone
Then you tell me to the left to the left
Then I'm right back for the sex for the sex
I know you're mad now but later on
Yea we gon' take it to the room
You can let out all of your aggression
And put it all on me like

I hate you
You ain't shit but I love you
Don't nobody else make me mad as you
But when we makin' up thought I'm glad it's you
Lady's sing it
[Repeat]

[Chorus]
