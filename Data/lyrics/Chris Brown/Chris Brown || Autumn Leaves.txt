
Yeah, baby, you, oh
Yeah, uh, uh

If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good
So I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus:]
Oh, it seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
(Oh oh oh)
I feel like you're the only reason for it
(Oh)
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It seems that you're the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your valiance
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poked and I poked and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'mma hope, I'mma hope so iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grand as ten Grammies or my granny still standing
With a note, a note that read "Granted, don't you panic."
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act mannish, just stay planted
Cause you reapin' what you sow
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry do you hear 'em, Lord?
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

[Chorus]
