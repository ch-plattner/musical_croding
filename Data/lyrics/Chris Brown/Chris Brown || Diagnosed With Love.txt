[Verse 1:]
I'm staring at the clock
It's a quarter to three
I'm tossing in my bed
Cause I just can't sleep
Cause you're not here with me
I'm reaching out for you
I wish I could talk to you
Trying to figure out what's going on with me
I'm used to having all the answers for everything
Oh girl
I think she is the one
Where is that coming from?

[Chorus:]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you
(Owe it all to you)
All those games, we
Used to play now
Seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with
Feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Verse 2:]
Does anybody know the answer to this question
Cause I'm confused so now
I'm opened for suggestions
My heart is talking loud (so loud)
What is this about (about)
I'm really changing now, oh
Cleared all the numbers out my phone
Done left that whole life alone
Those are two of the symptoms I see
And I believe
Oh girl, I am sure
That you are my miracle

[Chorus:]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you
(Owe it all to you)
All those games, we
Used to play now
Seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with
(So new to me, can somebody tell me)
Feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
Cause I've been diagnosed with love
(Lemme hear you say)

[Bridge:]
Na na na na na na (oh wee)
Na na na na (hey) na na na
If anybody feels me
Let me see you wave your hands
I'm diagnosed with love
And say, "I'm diagnosed with love."
And let me hear you say
Na na na na na na (oh)
Na na na na na (baby) na na
Baby
Cause girl, all I know
That you are the cure, baby

[Chorus:]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
(Baby, you simply amaze me)
So much more than lately
(And I owe it all)
I owe it all to you
(And I owe it all to you, oh)
All those games, we
(All those games we used to play, baby)
Used to play now
Seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with
Feels new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
Cause I've been diagnosed with love

Love, cause I've been diagnosed with love
Cause that you are the cure
Cause I've been diagnosed with love
Put your hands together now
Everybody put your hands together now
You are the cure
Cause I've been diagnosed with love
