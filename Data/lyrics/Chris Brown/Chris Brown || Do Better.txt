[Chris Brown:]
I don't know why I even try
'Cause you don't want this no more
I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I didn't have my faith
I see you're starting to hate me
I see it in your face

My home don't feel like home
Just like my heart, it's empty
You changed the number on your phone
So when I call, you ain't gotta listen

And all your girls think that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
Them bitches is basic
Now I'm number one that's lost in love
I can't take it
I'm on my knees
You're gonna see a grown man cry
I won't lie

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better

[Brandy:]
Looking at the names on your list and I can't find me
I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown?
I see you're happy now
You're the life of the party, acting out
Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once

And all your boys say that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
Them niggas is basic
And I'm the one who lost in love
And I can't take it
I'm on my knees
Don't you hate to see me cry?
I won't lie

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better

[Chris Brown & Brandy:]
Thinking 'bout you and I, thinking 'bout you and I
My heart's beating in slow motion knowing that it's over
Thoughts got me thinking 'bout suicide
Baby, this is do or die
When you told me it's over
Ain't no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away
I hope that God for forgive me
'Cause I know you ain't gon' miss me
Baby girl, I won't try to say my goodbyes
You ain't gotta shed a tear for me
Baby girl, don't cry

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better (I would do better, I would do better)

I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
