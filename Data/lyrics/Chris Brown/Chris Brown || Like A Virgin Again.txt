[Chris Brown:]
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Cause its getting hot girl,
Give me all you got girl
Don't have to rush, ain't going nowhere
I'll take off your thong, put you're legs in the air
Girl I'm gonna pick you up, pick you up
Rock you like a baby
Loving you so crazy
I'm gone' make you have a flash back
To your first time
But this time you know just what you like so. . .

[Chorus:]
Dont be acting shy up in this room
Like I make you nervous (ohh)
Ima take my time and do your body right
If you let me (uh huh)
Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again
Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again
Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again
Ima make you feel like a virgin,
Promise ima make it all worth it
Ima make you feel like a virgin again

Legs up to the sky
