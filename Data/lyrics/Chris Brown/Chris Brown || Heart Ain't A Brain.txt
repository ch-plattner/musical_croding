[Verse 1:]
It's a 360 turn
Sittin' where we begin
Beginning like here's the end
Like kissing
And missing class
But we needed to learn
Was different
Than just some math
It's the big picture
We missed it
The figures just didn't add up

[Pre-Chorus:]
We said
let's not leave on bad terms
In between
Them bad words
This could be love right?
Uh, huh
But are we gonna leave
When it's this good?
Damnit just cause
Seems this lovin's
All for nothing
Baby, you know

[Chorus:]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think
That I still love you (still love you)
A happy endin'
makes you cry
'cause it ends
When you don't want to (don't want to)
And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
How do I explain
This nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin'
That I still love you

[Verse 2:]
It's a fly twist
Just when you said
I got this
Right when the fight
Has stopped it
Seem my body felt wrong
Held on them nights
We held on
We can't let it go
But if we don't then
We will never know

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My heart is achin'
Thinkin' 'bout all the love we wasted
ooh, ooh, oh
My heart's impatient
Can't understand the time we're takin'
My heart can't have
My heart can't decide
But it's tellin' me it's right
And I know that
We should just call it quits
But I'm thinkin' that all of this
Gotta Change
'Cause my heart's goin' insane

[Chorus]
