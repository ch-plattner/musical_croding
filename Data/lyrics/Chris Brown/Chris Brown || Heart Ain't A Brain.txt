[Verse 1:]
It's a 360 turn
To sittin' where we began
Beginnin'
Like kids again
Like kissin'
And missin' class
But we needed to learn
What's different
Than just some math
It's the big picture
We missed it
The figures
Just didn't add up

[Hook:]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between
Them bad words
It could be love right?
Uh huh (uh huh)
But are we gon' leave
When it's this good?
Damn it was just 'cause
Seems this lovin's
All for nothing
Baby, you know

[Chorus:]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think
That I still love you (still love you)
A happy endin'
Makes you cry
'Cause it ends
When you don't want to (don't want to)
And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
How do I explain
This nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin'
That I still love you (still love you ... still love)

[Verse 2:]
It's a fly twist
Just when you said
I got this
Right when the fight
Has stopped it
Seem my body felt wrong
Held on all them nights
We held on
We can't let it go
But if we don't then
We will never know

[Hook:]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words
It could be love right?
Uh huh (uh huh)
But are we gon' leave
When it's this good?
Damn it was just 'cause
Seems this lovin's
All for nothing
Baby, you know

[Chorus:]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think
That I still love you (still love you)
A happy endin'
Makes you cry
'Cause it ends
When you don't want to (don't want to yeah)
And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
But how do I explain
This nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin'
That I still love you (still love you)

[Bridge:]
Ohh oh oh oh my heart is achin'
Thinkin' 'bout all the love we've wasted
Oohh ohh ohh
My heart's impatient
Can't understand the time we're takin'
My heart can't guess
My heart can't decide (can't decide)
But it's tellin' me it's right
And I know that we should just call it quits
But I'm thinkin' that all of this gotta change
Cause my heart is going insaneeeeee

[Chorus:]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think
That I still love you (my heart is going insane)
A happy endin'
Makes you cry (a happy ending)
'Cause it ends
When you don't want to (it'll make you cry cry cry)
And it makes perfect sense
To end it like the start
And how do I explain
This nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain
But I'm thinkin'
That I still love you (still love you)

Whoa ohoh whoa whoa ohoh whoa
Heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
Whoa ohoh whoa whoa ohoh whoa
Heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
Whoa ohoh whoa whoa ohoh whoa
Heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
Whoa ohoh whoa whoa ohoh whoa
Heart ain't a brain but I think I love you
[fades out]
