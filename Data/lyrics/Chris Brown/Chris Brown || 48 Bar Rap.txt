[Intro:]
Yea, It Go.
It's What They Wanted Right?

[Verse:]
Black Shades, Dark Tent
Yo Girl, Nigga I Get It In
Stick Shiftin, Switchin And Burnin Out In the Benz
Wood Grippin, Kissing All Of Their Model Friends
Mr Dolo, With A Bunch Of Freaks
And You Know They Get The Party Bouncing Like A Pogo
I'm In (Slow Mode)
But Fast Forward Me To The Part Where Me And Yo Girl Underneath The Sheets
Just Keep Yo Eyes On, Gotta Whole Bunch Of Niggas Behind Me Wearing Red, Verizon
New Money, I Get My Super Size On
I Like A Long Hair, Bad Chick, (Tights) Long
Haha, Knowing All The Words To My Songs
And She Fucking Every Girl That's On My Phone
Haha, I'm, I'm So Fly; Flight Models Up Cause I'm So High
Ha, Lil Nxgga Get Your Cheese Up
Black Ice On My Neck, Make You Freeze Up
Oh You Worry About Me, Go Figure
I Ain't Sweating It, Fuck Them Old Niggas
Lambo, Range Rove, With My Pants Low
I Got The Audience Clapping Like A Backboard
She Put Her Hands Up, And Then I Stand Up
And Getting To Working On The Pole, Like A Dancer
I Double Up, I Call It Double Dutch
Two Girls Did (the same time), What The Fuck
Rabbit Foot In The Air, Cause My Luck Is Up
Bring The First Eight Out, Cause I'm Cutting Up
Bang Bang, Now That's Some G Shit
No Chain Gang, Like I'm Really On Some Free Shit
Their Jaw Dropped, I'm Leaving Niggas Speechless
World Premiere, Get A Sneak Peek Bxtch
I'm Great, Today Is A New Day
Fucking With Me, Do The Moon Walk On Your Face
No Games, I'm Oh So Serious
And Ya'll Niggas Are Straight Pussy, PERIOD
They Say A Singer Can't Rap, I Ain't Hearing It
Cause After These Couple Songs, I Been Killing Shxt
Oh No, Niggas Saying I'm Loco
But They Pinocchio Nxggas, Watch Their Nose Grow
It's Young Money, Shouts Out My Nigga Tyga Too
They On Their First Mixtape, I'm On Volume Two
Turn Me Up, I'll Show You What A Tiger Do
And I'm a Rip This Beat Up Like Lion Food
Louie Luggage, And The Case For The Passport
I Don't Buy Shit, Nigga I Ask For It
I'm The Freshest, I'm The Best
I Suggest That I Get It Off My Mother Fucking Chest
BREEZY
