[Verse 1:]
Man I got... Lucky
Look What (What) I've stumbled Upon
A Woman That Sees Me (Me) For Me
Not What I've Done
You Give Me This (This) Feeling.
Willing To Give You My Time
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everything's Alright
You're Sorta Like

[Hook:]
Hearing The Birds Chirping In The Morning Light
Or Maybe Even Receiving A Kiss Goodnight
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends

[Chorus:]
When We're Together It Feels Ideal
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had
Oh Girl
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring

[Verse 2:]
We Kept Things Friendly (Friendly)
Without Crossing That Boundary
Darling I'm Expressing
Are You Listening?
You Give Me That (That) Feeling...
Willing To Give You My Time
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everything's Alright
You're Sorta Like

[Hook:]
Hearing The Birds Chirping In The Morning Light
Or Maybe Even Receiving A Kiss Goodnight
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends

[Chorus:]
When We're Together It Feels Ideal
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had
Oh Girl
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring

[Bridge:]
I Can Feel The flowers Blooming up
Under Us Smell The Plush Fragrance (Fresh & Lovely)
Winter Time Is Over There Is No Other I Would Rather Spend
My Time With Than You

[Chorus:]
When We're Together It Feels Ideal
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had
Oh Girl
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring
