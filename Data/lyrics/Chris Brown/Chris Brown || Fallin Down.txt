
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone 
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own 
Sometimes I don't wanna walk by your smile 
But at the same time I don't wanna let people down 

Can you imagine, the weight of a world 
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world 
And no-one can reach you, ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh 
So no-one can help you, nowwwww 

It's getting heavy I think I'm bout ready to break down 
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin down 
Time keeps on tickin on wish there was a way to slow it down 
Someone pick me up, cause I'm fallin down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down 

Why is it so easy for you to blame 
I'm only human we're all the same 
I've given up everything in exchange for being alone 
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride, ohhhhhhhh 

Can you imagine, the weight of a world 
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world 
And no-one can reach you, ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh 
So no-one can help you, nowwwww 

It's getting heavy I think I'm bout ready to break down 
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin down 
Time keeps on tickin on wish there was a way to slow it down 
Someone pick me up, cause I'm fallin down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down 
I'm fallin down, down, down, down, 
Down, down, down, down
