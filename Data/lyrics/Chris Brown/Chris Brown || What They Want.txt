These niggas mad, They mugging me
I like my pussy bowl Mr. Clean,
She started waxing, my dick relaxing
I make her bedrock, call me the mattress king
She got a sick body, I'm like her vaccine
Come to think about it, Vitamin D
Her ass up out them Jeans, but keep your heels on
The bedroom, yeah that's the kill zone
It's Young Money baby and it's CBE,
Let my name spell it out CMB
Haters don't bother me, blogs swallow these
Oops, now watch that beat on TMZ
Breezy bitch you know it's me
Your girl wetter than Polen Springs
So I go deeper under water, Submarine
Now let me dive-in, head first Yeah I'm a nice guy,
But I'm a grown motherfucker

[Tyga:]
All of these bitches in the party, these niggas fuck with me
But I don't fuck with nobody,
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby

[Chris Brown:]

Show me tits, grown men I don't fool around with kids
Rob Kelly, tell her piss me up 100 bid
Cash Money in this bitch
Young Money in your bizz, fuck around with that Label
Yellow labels on your ribs, that's the shit them niggas get
Homie, bitches bend they ribs, one time for the Shottas
Black hogs on them Choppers, bitch
Shit sound sick, water flow drowned bitch
Oh you smoke that seed a lot, my niggas on pounds bitch
We don't hit the club a lot, we be in them lounges
With them girls 5'10" front cover Vogue shit, bitch

All of these bitches in the party,
These niggas fuck with me, but I don't fuck with nobody
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby

Come here, let me show you,
Do it like I'm 'posed to (uh) nigga,

I'm what they want, I'm what they want (uh)
I'm what they want, I'm what they want (uh)
I'm what they want, I'm what they want (uh)
Come here let me show you, do it how I'm 'posed to, nigga

All of these bitches in the party,
These niggas fuck with me
But I don't fuck with nobody
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby
