The black card said go'head buy another drop.
Garage lookin something like a foreign car lot.
Wow, I swear I'm livin like monopoly.
And this hotel... property
Nothin in my wallet then I'm shittin on the lottery.
Ain't talkin twitter when I say yo girl follow me.
Give me yo patron before I perform.
Got me spittin so smooth I'm a call it drake ramon.

Actin like they love me someone give these hoes a emmy.
Fuck em all cause I know they all let me.
Shake they whole team feel like action in a SB.
Or the heisman status on high man.
How can I crash man when I'm flyer than the pilot.

All these niggas hatin on me.
Cause I'm the man of the hour, yeaahh.
