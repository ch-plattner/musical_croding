I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I was chilling, layin low in the club
Sippin on some s-s-syrp
Lookin for some s-s-skirt
That's when I saw her-her-her walk in
Lookin' good with a couple friends
She looked me dead in my eyes
Smiled then she walked by

Baby slow up
Let me holla at you for a minute
You look so good I couldn't let you go
Baby hold up
What you drankin' what you sippin' on
Come and join me in the VIP baby

[Chorus:]
What It Do
What's your name girl
Did you come here by yourself or 
Are you with somebody else?
What It Do
Gotta get to know you
You're so sexy you should let me
What It Do
I'm glad you came girl
Baby cause you made my night
I was 'bout to leave but you changed my mind
What It Do
Was poppin shawtyyy
I'm tryin to get to know you baby

Now she-she-she-she's playin' me
Way-way-way-way-way-way back
I'm all up in her face
All up in her space hopin' I don't need a tic tac
Cause I been drinkin'
I been smokin' all night in the club
and she's so fine and hell no I can't let her go

Baby slow up (slow up)
