Yo
It is an honor to introduce
The future of R&B
His name, is Chris Brown
And uh, you know what this is, (yeah)
Another Beat trax Joint

Round one I hear the ding,
I walk up in shake your hand
Girl I gotta know whats up,
Baby what's your name?
Can I get your number?
Cuz I want to talk about some things (yeah)

Round two it ain't a thing,
I was moving every way you move,
Bobbing and weaving,
Like a young boy was supposed to do,
It seemed like only yesterday that we did it,
Now you on me like a fitted,
And I just gotta say, yeah

[Chorus:]
Baby, you're a winner,
Didn't even take ya twelve rounds to do it
You got the title now,
I'ma tell the whole world (world)
To give it up for my girl (my girl)
Baby you're a winner,
Didn't even take ya twelve rounds to do it
You got the title now,
I'ma tell the whole world
To give it up for my girl

Round three I can see me and you walking down the aisle,
And I know we're young so it'll be a while
before we're doing that,
But my momma got me in training,
Getting ready for the day when I'ma make somebody happy (ohh ohh ohh)
Said I was done with lovin'
'til I found someone like you.
Oh somebody tell me what I was supposed to do,
You put my back against the ropes,
No choice but to unfold,
I gotta give it to you baby

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl,
Baby I just can't believe that every time you come around,
I start losing my breath,
I'm tripping over myself,
Cause you hittin' me, hittin' me
Oh girl, baby it's so plain to see that you got the best of me
So I'm throwin' in the towel baby I bow out,
Ooohh ooohh ooohhh oooh let it breath, (hah hah) oh

[Chorus 3x]

[Repeat chorus til end]
