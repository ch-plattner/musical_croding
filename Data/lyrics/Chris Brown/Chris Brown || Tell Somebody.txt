[Intro:]
Yeah
Wassup baby
Lemme ask you a question
Don't tell nobody
Think you got my love
Making love
Watching the sunrise
While Chris sings us a verse...

[Verse 1:]
Hey there pretty lady
Saw you at the bar
And I was mesmerized
You might think it sounds crazy
But I ain't never been a man to lie
Girl I don't think your ready
Cause you can't keep a secret very well
And aye girl if you let me
I might give you something to go and tell
Aye and I could just see it now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tryna hold it in
Tryna keep it down
But you keep screaming ah ooh

[Chorus:]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody [x2]

[Verse 2:]
And turn the lights down low girl
Cause you know I be waiting on you
Won't you hold me close girl
I'ma show you I got something prove
So go ahead tell all your girls
Yeah you tell 'em that I put it down
They all gon' want a piece of this
So you better keep it to yourself
Annh
Yeah I can just see it now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tryna hold it in
Tryna keep it down
But you keep screaming ah ooh

[Chorus:]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody [x4]

[Bridge:]
Just tell 'em how good it is
Oh yeah
And how it makes you feel oh ooh
And just tell 'em

How I'm pullin your hair from the back
And I got you shakin
Girl you better tell 'em all

A sexy sexy freaky freak
Just go and tell 'em
That I put it down
Oh

[Chorus:]
You're gonna wanna tell somebody
You're gonna wanna tell everybody [x4]

And turn the lights down low girl
Cause you know I be waiting on you
Won't you hold me close girl
