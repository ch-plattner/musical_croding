Ya'll Gon Like This Right (here)

There Are So Many Ways To Spell It Out
I Love You
But Only One Way To Show You
(One Way To Show You)
I Can Scare The Mountain
Yell It Out 'Til My Face Turn Blue
But When I Come Back Down What Did That Prove
(All That, What Did It Prove?)

I Would Rather Let, My Day To Day ? 
Actions Speak Louder Than What I Say
But If I Had To Pick The Letters From The Alphabetbet
I Would Say It This Way

"A" Maybe We Can "B" Something You Can "C" "DEF"initely
I Know You Want A "G" Who Can Take You "HI" Higher Than A "J"
What I'm Tryna Say
Is Love Is As Simple As ABC
All You Gotta Do Is Sing With Me

Since I Made It Clear
You Understand I Wanna Be With You
All I Wanna Know Is If It's Cool
Now It Would Hurt Me So If You Said I Know
Cause I Be On My "P"s and "Q"s
And I've "X"ed All The Rest
This Man's Only Got Eyes For Y-O-U

I Would Rather Let, My Day To Day ? 
Actions Speak Louder Than What I Say
But If I Had To Pick The Letters From The Alphabetbet
I Would Say It This Way

"A" Maybe We Can "B" Something You Can "C" "DEF"initely
