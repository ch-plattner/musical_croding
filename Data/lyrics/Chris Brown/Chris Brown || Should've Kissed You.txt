
Why Am I mad, I don't get it,
It seems like every time you give me signs,
And I miss it!
I did it again,
I admit it,
I left you standing there,
And now I regret it,
Seems like every time,
I get the chance,
I lose my cool, and I blow it,
And I get all tongue tied,
Lost in your eyes,
I'm a fool, and I know it!

[Chorus:]
I should've kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real!
I should've kissed you,
I should've told you how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how I feel

Now why didn't I
Give you my two cents,
A million reasons why I should have,
And it makes no sense,
So here I am,
By myself again,
Stopping for green lights, and I know,
I wanna be more than friends,
How come every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it,
And I get all tongue tied,
Lost in your eyes,
I'm a fool and I know it!

[Chorus:]
Hey,
I should've kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real!
I should've kissed you,
I should've told you how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how I feel!

So I turned the car around,
And you were right where I left you,
And your smile said you were feeling it too,
And the moon shined bright,
Cause when your lips met mine,
And yeah I finally got it right,
I'll be leaving with you tonight,
And I won't have to say,

[Chorus:]
I should've kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real!
I should've kissed you, Girl
I should've told you how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how I feel

Girl I should've kissed you,
I should've told you told you just how I feel,
And this time I won't stop,
Until I have your heart,
Cause what I'm feeling is real
