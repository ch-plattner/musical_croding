[Chris Brown:]
The Meanest The Meaner The Second I seen her
got me open Got Me looking Losing all my Control
The Passion I'm feinin
Baby You're The new Meaning
But I Found Myself Tripping When You Walked Through The Door
and I no It's not like me getting beside Myself She's Got Me Filling That Way
And I know It's not Likely That You're Gonna Deny Me And Just Walk Away

[Hook:]
I'll Be That Guy That don't Have Time To Play,
something Like a Schedule but it's about the same
The Ballers In The corner are Ready For your Game
It's looking Like your neck Are Ready For My Chain
She'll Be That Girl I'll Be Waiting For
Sending me them Signals That I Can't Ignore
thought I was gonna Get Her On The Dancefloor
Then I Saw Her Head To The Exit Door

[Chorus:]
Call Her Nice 'cause She's Got It,
Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause She's about It
that deer Nice 'cause I Got It Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause I'm about It
I'm Falling For Her, She's Got Me Trap
That Girl Is Nice 'cause She's Got, She's Got It, She's Got It, Breathe, Breathe

[Verse]
her body is Screaming
I Think That She's Missing
Ain't saying What You're Saying I'm Loosing My Cool
You Picture A Soldier now I Got Me A Rider
And You Ain't Got To Stress you 'cause It's Nothing To Prove
I Know It Ain't Easy Being A Sexy Girl that's Always Getting In Her Way
But I'm Gonna Tell you
You Got Me Up On you
And I Won't Slip Away

[Hook 1x]
[Chorus 1x]

[The Game:]

'cause This Ain't Def Jam And This Ain't Bad Boy
This Ain't Star Trek This Is The Last Court They Turning The Lights On

And We In The Frunt Now Whatmacher Seen You're Girlfriends
