[Verse 1]
I gotta problem, I got the answer now
No more singin' chicks I'm messin witha dancer now
She got a stripper pole, know how to break it down
She went from nothing to something, she tryna make it now
She's original I boosted up her style
She's got a downtown bich just to make me smile
We was finna go but she naked now, and she did it infront of an audience..

[Pre-Chorus]
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil waist, I ain't stupid can't let it go to waste
Man damn she got swag
Temperature heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash!
Go and try to get her, but when you do she says that I'm with her
They got the last, I'm chasin with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch em like sneakers

[Chorus]
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice, I gotta keep em laced cause my tounge game nice
I rock em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal can't take nothing from me cause I live that life [2x]

[Verse 2]
I can't get rid of her, can't understand it now 
I got the fresh girl nigga you got the hand me down 
You got the sloppy seconds, already dug it out 
I did my dougie, sat down and let her work it out 
She got them cakes out, I call her betty crock 
Mr. Flinstone I can make your bed rock
When I was tryna go, she got naked now 
Shawty took it off in a dolorian

[Pre-Chorus]
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil waist, I ain't stupid can't let it go to waste
Man damn she got swag
Temperature heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash!
Go and try to get her, but when you do she says that I'm with her
They got the last, I'm chasin with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch em like sneakers

[Chorus]
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice, I gotta keep em laced cause my tounge game nice
I rock em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal can't take nothing from me cause I live that life [2x]
cause I treat them like shoes

[Verse 3 - "Darkman"]
Whether Jordan 13s or Jordan D-wades 
With every new pair my old pair feel played 
New Carmellos, new Chris Pauls 
Little do they know I love all yall 
I treat em like pros, high top or lows 
Space Jam, Buggs bunny, Jordan retros 
She bring it back, Barkleys all black 
Or the red, white and gray Air Macs 
I like that, a closet full of sneakers 
Just like my black book full of freakers 
Lotta dark men, L.A deep 
Only wear nike or the timbaland shoes 

[Bridge] 
I treat em like shoes, yea that's what I do 
Nanny nanny boo boo, im shittin on you 
I treat em all like shoes, some rough and some smooth (just like shoes) 
More than ones that I use, she gotta a dunk alieou 
Nikes like new, treat em all like shoes (treat em all like shoes) 

[Chorus x2]
