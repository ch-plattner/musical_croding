(Can you hear me now?)

Yeah
Sweet like honey dew
I love it when you come around
It's just me and you, girl
And you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Her fragrance turns me on
Her skin's so soft, oh
I just wanna hold you
All night and day
And we got all the time, girl
So come a little closer
Cause I just wanna hold you
All night and day
I'm thinking 'bout you all day, all night
I'm holding on tight
Baby I just can't let you go

[Chorus x2:]
I get lost in ya love
I get wrapped in the words you say
I get lost in the love we make
I even fall hard for the games you play

Baby, you're the truth
I wanna talk about your loving
I'm so connected to you
I want it all, I need it all from you girl
You're my only one and you know that
I hold it down cause I own that
Too much history, we go way back
Its so personal and we got that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

Run it back, run it back, run it back
Oh, this my favorite song
And shout out to the DJ
Cause he gon' play this record all night long

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
