Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?

[Jordin Sparks:]
If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh

[Chris Brown:]
I'm here alone didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move it's incomplete
If there was a way that I could make you understand

[Hook: Jordin Sparks]
But how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

[Chrous: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air [x4]

[Chris Brown:]
I walk, I ran, I jump, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
WIth no gravity to hold me down forreal

[Jordin Sparks:]
But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breathe but I survived
I don't how but I don't even care

[Hook: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

[Chrous: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air [x4]
No more
It's no air, no air

[Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown:] OH

[Chrous: Jordin Sparks&Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, no air [x4]
[faded]
So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

[Jordin Sparks:] Got me out here in the water so deep
[Chris Brown:] Tell me how you gon be without me?
[Jordin Sparks:] If you ain't here I just can't breathe
[Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown:] It's no air, no air

No air, air [x3]

No air
