[Lil Wayne]
Ok
I can transform ya like a transformer
I turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you of the bench 
T-Turn you to a starter
Then I take you home and put you on a charger
T-Then my car transforms to a charter
And we could fly to wherever you ever thought of 
I’ll take you to where its warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm-up 
But I’m just getting warmed up 
So tell ya man he better get his voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati 
Then I transform me to a Bugatti
Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swiss on the beats Chris move ya feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak

I can transform ya

Anything you want
I can I can get it for ya
Get my baby girl she could know I did it for ya
I can trans I can trans I can transform ya
Shoes you got it got it
Bags you got it got it
Cars you got it got it
M-M-Money you got it got it
I can transform ya I can I can transform ya
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya
