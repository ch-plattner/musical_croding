Hey hey
I don't,

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you,
Body so sick gotta get next to you
I've been waiting all night long to know your name

Everything about you girl I want
And you gotta know that
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you

Girl, maybe we need to spend sometime
'cause you got me gone
(I'm so gone)
and there will be no playing with your mind
'cause this here is
More than before
This is real
I'm an 18 year old grown ass man trying to get in your life

Let's go!

[Chorus x2]

Everything about you girl I want
And you gotta know that
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you

Most don't get
All of that brain and the face is so flawless
She's such a beautiful girl
And every fantasy at night I dream about is all in you
If I try
Would you take me where you are?
That place that many won't ever get a chance to see
You've been so cold (been so cold)
Maybe (baby)
If you let me
Your flame (your flame)
Will be on again
Tell me what you want (come tell me what you want)
'cause I won't sleep
I won't cheat
Love me
It's all that you give

[Chorus x2]

I've been thinking about the way
That I'm gonna take it down
Ain't no way that you would being need
'cause you'd be all I'm thinking bout
Ain't no way

[Chorus x2]

Know your name
To know your name
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you

Tell me what I gotta do
I mean

I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you

I got the list right here
'Cause it's exclusive now

I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna know you
Read me your script later baby I'll call you

I'ma put you on it alright?
I'ma hit you up later

2 up 2 down I see you (ha ha)
Lets go
Yes, sir (peace)
And now you know
I'm out
(peace)
