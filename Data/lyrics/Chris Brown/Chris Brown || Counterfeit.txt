[Intro: Chris Brown]
Swear it isn't real
I like the way it looks
But I hate the way it feels oooh
I know what it is
I've seen this before
Got caught for a million
I know that I'm nervous
Cause it really ain't a thing
Natural about it
Water into wine please
She seem like America
I know that's impossible

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You don't wanna love maybe nah
Baby you gon' give me everything you got
Damn right
Say you love me
Ooh
Why you in my bed turning over
Like the greys of the ones before you
For you

[Hook: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party
In a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds
Counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Alright this is some old movie shit
Everything fake like a movie script
Everything I got public so
You already know how the groupies get
Pulled up in the fakest city
With my Lambo sitting in my rambo with me
Plus I got a bitch so bad
With a rep so cold big ass big titties
Stuck in a fairy tale lifestyle
Snow White rolling with the gold diggers
Nigga say how much for that one
Shit I ain't even know she was a hoe nigga
I meet these hoes everyday
Try to turn love like every way
Hundred dollars bills run the color of red
So I am counting my dough in a private place

[Bridge:]
You don't wanna love maybe nah
Baby you gon' give me everything you got
Damn right
Say you love me
Ooh
Why you in my bed turning over
Like the greys of the ones before you
For you

[Hook:]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party
In a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds
Counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, hold up wait
Shoulda been on time but you showed up late
Had a little feeling but it's gone a-way
Gave you a piece, you want a whole damn plate
Wanna play, wanna ball
Wanna have your cake and eat it all
Now I gotta new one outta state
So them ratchets gonna hate, but they hated Jesus man
Runnin around sayin you don't need a man
You know you gonna miss them private flights
Everything high with young Khalifa man
Everything paid for
Is taken it's course so much back and forth
It's a everyday thing now, WOOH
So I'm skatin
Heading straight for your replacement
Cause your story I couldn't take it
Had holes in it like Jason
But I stuck around and stayed patient
Momma called me up basin
Father called me up pacing
All your friends were all basic
Now I see right through you
What a thought a nigga had lasic
Extra cash, spent that so my car look like a spaceship
Wanna leave me that's cool
I was thinkin bout leavin you
Walked out the door like poof
Made it look like the King of Doo

[Hook:]
I keep looking for love
Can't find it in a party
In a whole room full of bodies
I keep looking for love
Dying over diamonds
Counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
