
Lord 
We come to you
Askin' you for the strength
And the guidance
To be man enough
To protect our children
'til the day that we die
Amen  

[Verse 1]
Devotion to that higher ground
Each day by day hes slowly fading
Its like we cant hear the sound
So I gotta be innovated
He sending all over the world now
We need to start makin changes
The light is covered up by the clouds
And my lifes constantly raining
When I think about the things
Youve done for me
And how you made me see,truthfully
I aint gon do you wrong no
Dont let no one of us go
Because I know

[Chorus]
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
From the sins ive done
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
Cause its all my fault

Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
From the belief ive lost
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
So im prayin to you God

[Verse 2]
Its not safe to say its over now
We're here now see
Little bodies laying on the ground
It coulda been your baby
Is someone gonna help us out
They need some food to eat
But there'll be brighter days
When we'll be saved
The Lord will send blessings
But when I think about the
Things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I aint gon do you wrong no
Dont let no one of us go
Because I know

[Chorus]
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
From the sins ive done
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
Cause its all my fault

Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
From the belief ive lost
Nobodys gonna save me (save me)
Gonna save me (save me)
So im prayin to you God 

Every step that we take from this day 
Oh Lord
We both hope
That its one of your directions
So take this song
As a token of our affection
We both apologize
Amen
