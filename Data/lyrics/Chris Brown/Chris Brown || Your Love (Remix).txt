[Chorus:]
Shawty I’mma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, I’mma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ain’t nothin’ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
It’s your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickin’ your lips, do it like that (Baby) 

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, five five, lookin’ real fine 
Got me like the sun, girl look at me rise 
Hot lil’ thang, up in my ride 
I’m hard as hell, I ain’t gon’ lie (ain’t gon’ lie) 
Shawty bad, know she a keeper 
But shawty did some things I ain’t even seen before 
And shawty turned me into a believer 
I can do whatever, long as I don’t mess her weave up 
What my name is? Go on, scream it, when I’m all in that thang shawty 
Cause we been playin’ this game all day 
And I’m ready to go all the way 
And I’mma do it like aw, sookie sookie nah 
And we can roll play, girl give it to me now 
I’m giving you a massage, your booty like Nicki Minaj (Oh gosh) 

[Chorus:]
Shawty I’mma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, I’mma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ain’t nothin’ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
It’s your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove (Yeaaaah, yeah) 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickin’ your lips, do it like that (Baby) 

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, let me step up to the plate now 
Big kid’s in the room, no playground 
I wanna kiss everything from the waist down 
Keep your ass up, and your face down 
Oh girl, lovin’ the way you do it 
Freakin’ me to the music, keep a hat on like I’m Jewish 
HA! They be like ‘Chris you foolish’ 
Uh uh, what you take me for, a groupie? 
Nah. Just wanna get you to my sex room 
And do my sh*t, and I don’t mean restroom 
First class, takin’ bubble baths 
Tell her throw it in the bag like she takin’ out the trash 
Yeah, now let me see what you about now 
If you official with this sh*t, I’mma bow down 
I’mma eat it up, yeah, I’mma chow down 
Sayin’ all type of sh*t like WOW! DAMN! 

[Chorus:]
Shawty I’mma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, I’mma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ain’t nothin’ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
It’s your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove (Yeaaaah, yeah) 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickin’ your lips, do it like that (Baby)
