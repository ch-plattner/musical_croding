[Chorus]
I just wanna
(Take my time)
As stingy as you are,
Think you're ready?
Girl I wanna,
(Do you right)
I just wanna give you what you need,
Baby girl,
(Take my time),
Oh Oh
Just do me,
(Do you right)

[Verse 1]
Girl when you step off,
Wet from out the shower baby,
I want you to lay down,
just stay naked,
Now I'm staring for an hour babe,
Oh,
I got your back up against the wall,
I got strength,
Wont let you fall,
When I make you bloom,
Like a flower babe,
Babe

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It ain't your fault you ran out of power babe,
Cause I've been kissing and licking on you everywhere,
Oh,
I wanna hear you scream my name,
And girl you know my way,
Baby it's pull away for you babe
Oh

I just wanna
(Take my time)
(Said I wanna take)
As stingy as you are,
Think you're ready?
Girl I wanna,
(Do you right),
(Do you right)
I just wanna give you what you need,
Baby girl,
(Take my time),
Oh Oh
Just do me,
(Do you right)
(Do you right oh yeah yeah)

I just wanna
(Take my time)
Take my time
As stingy as you are,
Think you're ready?
Girl I wanna,
(Do you right),
(Said I wanna do you)
I just wanna give you what you need,
Baby girl,
(Take my time),
Oh Oh
Just do me,
(Do you right)
I just wanna
(Take my time)
As pretty as you are,
Think you're ready?
Girl I wanna,
(Do you right),
I just wanna give you what you need,
(Imma give ya what you need)
Baby girl,
(Take my time),
Oh Oh
Just do me,
(Do you right)
(Imma do you right yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah
