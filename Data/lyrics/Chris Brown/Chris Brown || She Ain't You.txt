[Verse:]
You make It hard for me to see somebody else
I'm calling her your name
Yea it's messed up, cause I'm thinkin 'bout you
It's your fault babe
I never wanted us to break up
No not this way
But you don't understand it girl
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex
With you I had a bad romance
And if I could, just trade her in I would
Cause nobody compares to ya

[Chorus:]
I think I better let her go
Cause I can't leave you alone
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you
I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you
Oh (no she ain't you)
Whoa oh oh (Na na na)
Whoa oh oh (Na na na)
She ain't, no she ain't you

[Verse:]
I've been sleeping out
For quite some nights now
It's not the same in my bed
But if she found out what's going on in my head
It'll be all bad, have me right back
But you don't understand it girl
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex
With you I had a bad romance
And if I could, just trade her in I would
Cause nobody compares to ya

[Chorus:]
I think I better let her go
Cause I can't leave you alone
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you
I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you
No she a-ain't she ain't you [x8]

I think I better let her go
Cause I can't leave you alone
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you
I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you
Oh (no she ain't you)
Whoa oh oh (Na na na)
Whoa oh oh (Na na na)
She ain't, no she ain't you
