
Hot passin hour in the club
I was trying to cut her up
I was sippin on
Tryin to find the missing link
You had a mission trying to vouge
Then I came right through the smoke
I was smoking hot
Catch my fever lets burn up the floor
I need to know, how to get into you
Baby im liking your butt (bod)
Oooo you got me stuck
So I can enter you
How I can flow my moves

[Chorus:]
Dont breathe
I want to take a breath
Let your body feel it all night, from your body
It can charge you all up
Lets start a riot on the floor
Wait till you pass out
Wait till you pass out, yeeeah
Wait till you pass out
Wait till you pass out

Im all amped up and its so hard to turn me down
Lets burn shit up cause im your fire starter now
I'll bring it back can you smell that
Now that im a rockstar i just wanna stomp your heart
Go Go and start on the dance floor
Go go am i what you ask for
I'm a monster not a pretty little girl
Eyes on me so come follow me

[Chorus]
