[Verse 1:]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there (damn)
Why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Hook:]
You're hearing rumours about me
And you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body
When you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you

[Hook:]
So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful

[Verse 2:]
Everything I say right now
Is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like:
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby the fact is

[Pre-Hook:]
You're hearing rumours about me
And saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry
Making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy
Saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset (damn).
You're beautiful

[Hook:]
So, baby
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful

[Bridge:]
Just let the past
Just be the past
And focus on things
That are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am, not who I was
I promise I'll be, the one that you can trust

[Hook:]
So please
So please don't judge me (don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (I won't)
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful (before it gets beautiful)
Please don't judge me (so please don't)
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful [x4]
Let it be beautiful ay
Let it be beautiful yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro:]
I don't wanna go there baby (yeah)
We should never go there
