[Verse 1]
Came here on a mission with one thing on my mind,
Yeah I came here alone but I'm leavin here with a dime (shawty your a dime, your so fine)
Ooh girl you got my full attention and its somethin bout you, girl the way you wind it up
Make me wanna get behind you so want you girl...

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here,
Right now I'm headed to my car and to the crib
And baby we can leave pronto and go into my condo
You gon black out tonight
Blow yo back out (out out) [4x]
Blow yo back out

[Verse 2]
Imma make sure that you feel me put your ankles where your hands be,
And I'm all up on you (all up on you) tryin to put you to bed
Ima do it in my boots, your stilettos you can leave em' on,
Ima dog, Ima dog gimmie a bone
Act like we makin babies, sexin you soo crazy or don't forget bout before
Play with me I promise I will make it go ooooo, when I'm lovin you its like I'm swimmin in a pool
You know what it is, girl give me a kiss and I'm happy that you came thats a double meanin'
Ima sleep sleep sleep your kittys like a lullaby I'm soo glad that I'm in that

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here,
Right now I'm headed to my car and to the crib.
And baby we can leave pronto and go into my condo
You gon black out tonight
Blow yo back out (out out) [4x]
Blow yo back out

[Hook]
Whats ya name? Whats ya aim? Hit me later on and maybe we can hang
You can call your girls, Ima call my boyss, I'm choosin em' tonight and your my choice come on

[Chorus]
Girl the club about to close come over here,
Right now I'm headed to my car and to the crib
And baby we can leave pronto and go into my condo
You gon black out tonight
Blow yo back out (out out) [4x]
Blow yo back out
