[Chris Brown:]
Girl just come home with me
You in the passenger side when I'm drivin'
Girl you kissin' all on me
Lickin' my neck when my hand's on your thigh
And I'm makin' that pussy leak
Knowin' just what you want
Cause you ain't had dick in a week
And I know that you're a freak

[Pre-Hook - Chris Brown:]
Girl I know you're down for playin'
I know you're listenin' to what I'm sayin'
Your body done started up this conversation
We should really take this inside, when I'm inside
Girl, let's get it

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
We party all night, then you leave in the mornin'
Girl when you ride it, act like you're performin'
You a bad mothafucka, you the shit right now
Play your position, we switchin' positions, lights out

[Chris Brown:]
Girl I'm 'bout [?] and I'ma eat it on the floor
You'll see what you mean to me but first I need you on all fours
Now ass up, face down, when we're lovin'
Slow motion, in and out
Girl when you rain, I'ma break you off
Really need to take them panties off
Your body on my body, drippin' wet, baby
Lickin' on it got my dick way too hard
Girl I'm just in it explorin'
I got the camera recordin'
Makin' that pussy too soft and
You get it again in the mornin'

[Tyga:]
Drop funds on some new shit right now
I ain't talkin' yesterday, I mean right now
New Audemars for you and this lifestyle
Lingerie on, got you all wified down
Where you wanna be right now?
Ride on my top, now you all on my top
What you wanna be right now?
Got you all in my palms and that ass is the bomb
Versatile, got your Versace on
Fur, on the couch, lips soft, fresh out the shower
25th hour, eat it like [?] chow
Lick it down, yeah, use your mouth
Light up a blunt and we're zoned to the mornin'
Back to the sex and performin'
This time I'ma make sure it's recordin'
(When I take you down, down)

[Fat Trel:]
Called me on the phone and she opened up the door
I be skippin' all the kissin', get to hittin' it on the floor
Take it to the kitchen, so many different positions
Fuck her real slow, she talkin', I like to listen
On the roll with it, she don't like to pay attention
All this money on my mind but the pussy what I'm missin'
Skip the penitentiary, I'm [?] whipped
Sneakin', we freakin', no sleep on the weekend
But I just wanna hit it by the lake
From the back, from the front while I'm grippin' on her face
I just wanna give her what you can't
Fly her all around the world, poppin' bottles of the Ace
I just wanna take her to the bank
Shoppin' trip, what you get? DC, LA
I should let her meet CB, he a freak
She could give my young nigga what he needs
