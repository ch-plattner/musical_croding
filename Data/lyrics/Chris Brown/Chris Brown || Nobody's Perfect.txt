
You and I too sweet not just beautiful
Cause you follow your heart
It makes even more special that you don't know how damn lovely you are
I would kiss a mirror every single day
If I wake up with your face
What are all these doubts fall spinning in your head
Don't you look so sad

Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I can’t believe you’re true
Cause nobody nobody nobody’s perfect but you

[beat break]

Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you

When you stand close to me I get paralyzed
I forget how to breath
Every place is the sake, ain't it feel so wrong
Every time that you leave
You catch me when I'm falling
You bring me back to life
When I'm dying you rise
What are all these doubts fall spinning in your head
Don't you look so sad

Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I can’t believe you’re true
Cause nobody nobody nobody’s perfect but you

[beat break]

Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you

Yeah You mean the world to me
Nobody nobody, nobody’s perfect but you

Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I can’t believe you’re true
Cause nobody nobody nobody’s perfect but you
