Girl You Know I Got A Problem Witchu, Yeah
Cause You Ain't Right, No
Girl You Ain't Fair, No
You Don't Even Seem To Know How You Be Messin With Me, Hey
What Am I S'pose To Do
When All I Wanna Do Is Claim You
What Am I S'pose To Do
When You Be Lookin The Way You Do
You Don't Recognize
There's Somethin About Ya Little Mami
You Don't Realize
I Wanna Be Witchu Shawty

How Am I Suppose To Keep My Cool
When You Be Comin 'Round
You Be Hangin Out
Tell Me What Do You Expect For Me To Do
Girl You're So Right
It Jus Ain't Right, No
I Swear To God 'Bout How You Look In Dem Jeans ? 
The Way You Be Walkin And Workin Them Heels
Girl You Jus Don't Know I'm Tryna Be Solo
But You're So Right
It Jus Ain't Right, No

Girl You Know You Got Me Givin Up On My Homies
And I Don't Go Out At Night Cause We Do What I Like
I Don't Even Seem To Care About Nothin But You, Ooh...
What Am I S'pose To Do
How Am I S'pose To Go Back To Bein Friends
What Am I S'pose To Do
How Long Do I Gotta Pretend
You Don't Recognize
There's Somethin About Ya Little Mami
You Don't Realize
I Wanna Be Witchu Shawty

How Am I Suppose To Keep My Cool
When You Be Comin 'Round
You Be Hangin Out
Tell Me What Do You Expect For Me To Do
Girl You're So Right
It Jus Ain't Right, No
