
You don't even call anymore
It's so different from the way it was before
Everyday I hear your pretty voice
I have no choice, but to be all alone without you
There's so many mistakes we make in love
Cause still I'm thinking this is something we can solve
I take all the blame for breaking your heart
But you can't let it tear us apart
Because

She didn't mean anything to me (nothing)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (oh noo)
Girl you know it ain't true
If you believe (yeeah)
Please accept my apology (please accept my apology)
I didn't mean to hurt you girl

I didn't see myself settling down
But I knew from the first time you came around
From the moment I looked into your eyes
I never want to see you cry over meeee
But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never, ever wanna break it up
I wasn't ready for you until this day
Could you believe when I say that

[x2:]
She didn't mean anything to me (no she didn't)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (no she was not)
Girl you know it ain't true (yeeah)
If you believe
Please accept my apology (baby I didn't mean)
I didn't mean to hurt you girl
