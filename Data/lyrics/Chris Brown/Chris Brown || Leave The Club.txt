I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else,
Just love me girl (Cause you're bad)
All by yourself
Just love me girl

Who is she?
She gotta special type of perfume
And her bag balenciaga
It's full of tricks, look at her move
Damn, I feel guilty
Cause I ain't offer her a seat in VIP yet
Girl I know you wanna drink just dance for me
You're not gonna regret
Cause I ain't got ones all I got is hundreds
Girl you look so amazing when you do it
There's no better time to play my music, for her
[Spoken:] I betcha

I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club
All I really want you to do is scream my name
And nobody else,
Just love me girl (Cause you're bad)
All by yourself
Just love me girl

[Joelle James:]
I can feel you lookin my way
And my body's all alone
You're in a daze
You think you're gonna take me home
Ya know, I'm thinking it too, it's on my mind
Cause I ain't got ones all I got are hundreds
Don't I look so amazing when I do it?
Why we still wasting time let's do it
Get your car
[Spoken:] I betcha

[Chris Brown:]
I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club (When we leavin?)
All I really want you to do is scream my name (I'm wanna scream it baby!)
