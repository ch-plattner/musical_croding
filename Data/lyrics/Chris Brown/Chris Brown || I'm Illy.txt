Teyana Taylor what's good?
C. Breezy in the building
Yeah man,
Let's goï»¿ in
I'm in the clouds homie, no gas mask
Paper long stack higher than giraffe's ass
Not used to driving spaceships, so I'm landing wrong
On some ugly shit, ET with a bandana on
Dolce book bag, Louie rag, hanging on the right side
Red lightning in my hair, I'm looking on the bright side
Listen to my music, yes, I highly recommend it
But if you ain't messing with it, why the hell you commenting?
And I'm really loving rapping now know I had to get it in
Listening to rappers and some of them sounding feminine
Any stage or any show, I been there or I done it
Too big and these girls run from it
These young niggas here now and we bout to shut it down
My little sister Teyana Taylor and yeah I'm Chris Brown
And ain't no goons with me, go on act silly
Don't forget modafuca I'm illy

[Teyana]
I guess the magazine's just ain't enough
Still wanna play wit us
When dat beat get murdered right away you know they say its us
Blog sites, web sites, they all know I'm dead nice
Porsche at the red light, you hardern chicks is dead tight,
Money steady generatin, haters give me inspiration,
Swagged out generation, got ya child board skatin,
MOB so solid, Ray Bans so poppin
Multi colored finger nails, cranberry phone posse
Killin every beat I touch, pardon every thing I say, pen game, whip game
I just bought a car today
Jealous of my one of a kind swag, yah dumb match
Shorty tried to copy and paste my style she's dumb gas
Scared of nobody, I push it to the limit, you rap chicks is burnin
Here's a number to a clinic, Cb is here with me, get familiar with the movement,
Neglect every instrumental I use my body and abuse it.
