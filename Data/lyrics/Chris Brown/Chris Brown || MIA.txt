[Verse 1:]
Whoooow
What are you thinking?
I know you see your cell phone blinkin
Backwards and forwards I'm pacing
Trynna firgure out why you ain't calling me back...
What does it all mean? maybe tryin' to show me something
But you ain't gotta do it
This way, noooo
Put yo' self in my shoes tell me, what would you do

[Chorus:]
She knows I been gettin her on the phone
And I know she been gettin it somethings wrong
Could it be that she's with
The other dude from her past
I know damn well that she ain't
She not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking bout the same again
I'm going to find out just what she's been M.I.A.

[Verse 2:]
Is there a problem
And if it's really one I'm a solve it
Don't know how you handeled other dudes but I'm not them
Girl you run around got em thinking that I
Can't handle my thing
Oeh, are you crazy did you really think you could play me?
I'm bout to show up on your door step
You better answer when I, knock knock
You better be by yourself

[Chorus:]
She knows I been gettin her on the phone
And I know she been gettin it somethings wrong
Could it be that she's with
The other dude from her past
I know damn well that she ain't
She not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking bout the same again
Said I'm going to find out just what she's been M.I.A.

[Bridge:]
You can't run (cause the boy he gonna find ya girl)
You can't hide (cause you know I'm right behind ya girl)
If you tellin' the truth
Then why you actin like you're scared? over there
You can't run (cause the boy he gonna find ya oh)
You can't hide (cause you know I'm right behind you oow)
If what you say is true
Than why you can't call me back baby, baby, yeahehe

[Chorus:]
She knows I been gettin her on the phone
And I know she been gettin it somethings wrong
Could it be that she's with
The other dude from her past
I know damn well that she ain't
She not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking bout the same again
Said I'm going to find out just what she's been M.I.A.
