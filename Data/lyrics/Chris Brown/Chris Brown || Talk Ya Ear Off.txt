[Verse 1]
I got what you want, waaant
Girl I want you, so grab a couple a friends
And let's go out
And if you’re nasty I’m nasty too,
I’ve got a whole section already reserved for you
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Don’t talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor,

[Verse 2]
Girl I got your heart
Heart! I know what to do, baby
Just sit that pretty thing on my lap, on my lap,
That big oh booty
I’m telling the truth, baby
It’s only you that I gotta have
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Don’t talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor,

You know it, you know it baby

[Chorus]
I say, I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
I’m gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Don’t talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor
