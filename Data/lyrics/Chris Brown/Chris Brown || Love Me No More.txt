[Kid Ink:]
Said I ain't even gotta say shit
You know who I'm talking to
Said I ain't even gotta say shit

[Chris Brown:]
Baby you know, that I cry all these tears for you
No one compares to the smile you make when
When I hit it, taste that kitty
I ain't even gotta say shit
Ten girls in the back seat nigga I'm with it
She broke my heart, I guess she's a superstar now
When all I really needed was your love

[Chorus - Chris Brown:]
She don't wanna love me no more
She said I was doing too much
And now I'm all alone with nobody
I might as well roll up
I'm tired of fighting, already been down that road
And she don't wanna love me no more
She don't wanna love me no more

[Kid Ink:]
She don't wanna love me no more
All her shit parked front at the front door
How the hell did we get here so damn fast?
Foot to the gas tryin' to cover your nose
Stop sniffing around still ain't gonna find nothing
Acting like Sherlock Holmes or something
They say love don't cost a thing
But I can see change girl keep it one hunnid
If you really wanna leave
If you really wanna go, you gotta make it through me
I ain't doing this alone
Think I'm going insane and it usually turns you on but right now

[Chorus]
