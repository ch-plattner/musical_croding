
Uh, Sneak peek through the window pane.
Girls all aboard, this Young Money train.
Ever since fame,
Shit'll never be the same.
The world want a show,
So I'm a be the stage.
Dim the lights,
Listen to what I'm gone say.
Gotta fan base nigga,
Fuck what a hater say.
They sleep all day,
I'm up early doe.
Scrollin through the phone,
I'm watchin videos.
Not much competition doe.
I mean of course, it's just the same ol'
Bitches in plain clothes,
Playing the same roles.
Rentals of Lambos.
Bend over bitch
Getting one.
You know how game goes.
Shame on all these models.
But I'm a still buy all these bottles.
Got a lot to learn young man.
Life is your only friend.
One day you'll understand.
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi',
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
SaidI'm moving too fast,
They say I'm moving too fast.
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite,
Baby you could spend the night.
Say you moving too fast.
Said I'm moving too fast.
Y'all be gossiping more than the barber shop.
Walked up in the shop,
Everybody looking shocked.
Why all the talking stopped?
Maybe, cause I was the one being talked about.
Looking at your face,
I can tell you don't know what this money 'bout.
Four accounts, can't bounce
Nigga, check the amount.
I took a pill getting drowsy now.
Gotta finish this verse, can't write it down.
Early flight, now I'm out of town.
Freaking out, all I see is clouds.
Hawaii looking nice man.
Why every time I leave L.A. it's an earthquake?
Why every time I leave home, bitches thirsty?
Saying she be with a nigga all night.
Telling her friends that "I'm the only girl that he like".
You gotta lot to learn young man.
To all your loyal fans, I hope they understand.
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi',
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
Say I'm moving too fast,
They say I'm moving too fast.
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite,
Baby you could spend the night.
Say you moving too fast.
Said I'm moving too fast.
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi',
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
Say I'm moving too fast,
They say I'm moving too fast.
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite,
Baby you could spend the night.
Say you moving too fast.
Said I'm moving too fast.
