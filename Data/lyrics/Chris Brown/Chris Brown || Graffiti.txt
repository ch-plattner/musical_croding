
I see you writin' on my wall, why you wanna do that (do that) 
My name is tagged, you already see that (see that) 
The media wanna paint it all black, and they do it right in my face 

See I can't sit back, and let it all wash away (wash away) 
I worked too hard, for it to be erased 
Before you talk, Imma finish what I gotta saayy 

Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
You know I grind 
Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle 
Even though the pain, I still gon' have to hustle 
Man, I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity 
Oh no 
Man I can't let you do it 

Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
On my name (name) 
Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
On my name (name) 
But it's already writtin on the wall 

Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
But it's already written on the wall 
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 

Who got award shows rockin everytime I hit the stage (time I hit the stage) 
Even the haters went and bought a CD 
But now my fans I'm an empty spray can 
And I just cant paint a thing 

Seem like the less I have the money, the less I have the problems 
The more I got the money, the more I got the problems (hello) 
Let me clear my throat, gotta make sure you hear me go 

Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
You know I grind 
All of this struggle, all of this struggle 
Even though the pain I still gon' have to hustle 
Man I had to feed my family (ly), and at the same time keep my sanity 
Oh no 
Man I can't let you do it 

Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
On my name (name) (on my name, on my name, on my name) 
Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
On my name(name) 
Cause it's already writtin on the wall 

Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
Cause it's already written on the wall 
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up baby 

Its already done ain't gonna paint no more 
With all this pain that I've endured 
I know, I was wrong for what I did 
And I made some mistakes cause I'm human 
I aint gon feed into the negative 
Imma keep grindin, oh yeah 
On this graffiti, oh, oh, oh 

Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
You know I grind through 
All of this struggle, all of this struggle 
Even though the pain I still have to hustle 
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity Oh no 
Man I can't let you do it, 

Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
On my name (name) 
Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), on my day (day) 

Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
Can't cover it up can't cover it up
