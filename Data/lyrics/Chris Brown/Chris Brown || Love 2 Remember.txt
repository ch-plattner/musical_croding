[Intro:]
Why do we argue?
Why do we scream?
I wish it was better
I don't want you to leave

[Verse 1:]
I'm tryna make peace babe
These tears run down my face
So I close my eyes, but we both cry
And you say this is it baby baby
She said she tired of my shit, she wanna quit
The funny thing, I've been good to her
Not doing shit...
But she think that I've been fuckin' with
Keisha, Latoya and Lisa
Dirty Diana, Nicki and Amber
Got to be out of your damn mind

[Hook:]
Tell me what's the deal with you?
There's something wrong, I feel it too
We hardly see each other
And now you wanna talk about space
You changed...
You wanna leave me now but you can't tell me
Why do we argue?
Why do we scream?
I wish it was better, I don't want you to leave
So sick & tired of drinking this bottle
Contemplating the pill overdose
I think this one shot will stop the pain
And now I'm sleeping, I just wanted you to love me

[Verse 2:]
Got myself on speed dial, 9-1-1
I got a whole in my heart, one bullet and a gun
Belly full of pills, running out of time
Sitting here waiting, just to say goodbye to my love
Farewell, I'm gonna miss you
You'll always go back to the day when I said girl

[Hook]

[Outro:]
This is a love to remember
Yeah, this is a love to remember
Don't cry, don't cry
We'll meet again once upon a time
This is a love to remember
Yeah, this is a love to remember
Don't cry, don't cry
We'll meet again once upon a time
