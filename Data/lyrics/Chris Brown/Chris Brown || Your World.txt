[Intro:]
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
Your world

[Verse 1:]
(I been)
Chilling on the beach
Down in mexico
Staring at the lights up in Tokyo
Dancing in Spain as the rain falls down
(I been)
In New York City
Where they never sleep
First class flights on the way to Greece
I been everywhere
And back around
See I been to London
And I been through France
And all that means nothin
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus:]
Cause it's your world
Yea it your world
That I've never been
Until you let me in
Cause in my world
Yeah in my world
I can never win
Until you let me into your world

[Verse 2:]
I can't stop thinking bout you every night
Picturing your body laying next to mine
What's it gonna take for you to open up
Cause I wanna know everything about your world
I wanna be there when you need me girl
I wanna be more than a fool in love

[Pre-Chorus:]
See I been to London
And I been through France
And all that means nothin
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus:]
Cause it's your world
Yea it your world
That I've never been
Until you let me in
Cause in my world
Yeah in my world
I can never win
Until you let me into your world

[Bridge:]
Baby let me dive into your ocean
Let ee wish on your shooting star
We gotta put this thing in motion
Bring our two worlds to the same heart

[Interlude:]
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
Come on girl

[Chorus:]
Cause it's your world
Yea it your world
That I've never been
Until you let me in
Cause in my world
Yeah in my world
I can never win
Until you let me into your world
Cause it's your world
Yea it your world
That I've never been
Until you let me in
Cause in my world
Yeah in my world
I can never win
Until you let me into your world

[Outro:]
Your world
I wanna live in it
(I wanna live in it)
Your world
I wanna live in it
(Just need to live in it)
Your world
I wanna live in it
(I wanna live in it)
Your world
(Your world)
Your world
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
I wanna live in it
Your world
Your world
Your world (your world)
