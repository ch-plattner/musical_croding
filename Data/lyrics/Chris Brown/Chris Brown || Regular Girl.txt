[Verse: Tyga]
Picture Life In The Movie Frame
Smiles In Your Face But Every Body Fake
Tryna Claim A Role, Acting On The Stage
The World Wanna Show And We All The Play
Just To Say, Why Didn't You Want Me Yesterday
I Blacked Out, Got Some Change, Now They Feeling Me
Couple Chains, Gold Chains On, Mr Tee
They See Me Low Key So Nigga Don't Bother Me
I Wanna Relax With Some Time, All Just For Me
Cause Lately I Been Meeting Girls, Chasing Me
Wanted The Spotlight, Damn, She Spotted Me
Dang You Bad Baby, Let Me Tell You One Thing

[Chris Brown & Tyga:]
You Got It (I Like How You flaunt it)
And I Need It (I Really, Really Want It)
Can I Get (Oh)
Your Love?
Girl I'm On It (I'm Really, Really On It)
Til Morning (I Be Up In the Morning)
What I Gotta Do To Meet You (I Just Want This)

[Chorus:]
I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl, When I Get Home Yeaa

[Verse: Chris Brown]
The Fame Don't Mean Nothing, Neither Does The Money
I Just Want My Friend Right Here With Me
The Light Will Fade Away, No Matter How Hard I Grind
Today Ain't The Day, So I'm Just Gonna Live My Life
All Day Long, Same Shit Different Video
All Them Silly Games, I Don't Wanna Play No More

[Chris Brown & Tyga:]
You Got It (I Like How You flaunt it)
And I Need It (I Really, Really Want It)
Can I Get (Oh)
Your Love?
Girl I'm On It (I'm Really, Really On It)
Til Morning (I Be Up In the Morning)
What I Gotta Do To Meet You (I Just Want This)

[Chorus:]
I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl
Want A Regular Girl [x2]

I Want A Regular Girl, When I Get Home Yeaa
