[Intro — Lil Wayne & Chris Brown:]
Young mula, baby (let me see)!
Ha ha, you thought it was over?
(let me see)

[Verse 1 — Lil Wayne:]
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

[Hook — Chris Brown:]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Bridge — Chris Brown:]
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches

[Verse 2 — Chris Brown:]
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to The Bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley, I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers

[Hook]

[Verse 3 — Chris Brown:]
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it (right away)
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know, girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no, girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 4 — Tyga:]
Uh
Rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger
So my chains got bigger
Ferrari, Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thing!"
Ha, me and CB in the bay with her
I send her back home so you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Shout-out Weezy F., keep a red bone wet
Rose Rolex, hoes on deck
She know I got a cheque
Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man I wouldn't trust that bitch
No!

[Verse 5 — Chris Brown:]
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby, show me something
You just spent your bread on her
And it's all for nothing

[Hook]
