Your body is a blessing,
Ain't no second guessing,
Ain't got no competition cause
Shawty, you the bestest.
Ain't no hesitation,
I'm tryna get you naked,
You got something that I wanna see.

Your clothes look good,
But they look great on the floor,
So hurry up & take them off.

Don't act like we ain't did this before,
So baby let's go
And bring your body over here.

Baby you
Want all the time
And I do to.
Can we get really freaky,
However you want it.
Girl, it's up to you.

Take it all off (ohh),
Won't you lick it in the dark, (ohh)
Take it all off (ohh).
However you want,
Girl it's up to you (you).

And I wanna do something nasty tonight (night [x3]),
And everything you do to me girl it feels so right (right [x3])

Love when you feeling me,
I got you moaning.
You ain't gonna go to sleep,
Not until morning.

Giving you chills down your spine,
Yeaaah yeah yeaaah

Your clothes
Look good, but they look great on the
Floor,
So hurry up & take them off.

Don't act like we ain't did this before,
So baby let's go
And bring your body over here.

Baby you want all the time
And I do to.
Can we get really freaky,
However you want it.
Girl, it's up to you.

Take it all off (ohh),
Won't you lick it in the dark, (ohh)
Take it all off (ohh).
However you want,
Girl it's up to you (you).
