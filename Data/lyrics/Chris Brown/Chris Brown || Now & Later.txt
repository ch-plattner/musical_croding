[Verse 1:]
It's like I'm at a candy buffet
Gum drops, blow pops, strawberries, and grapes
I know
You got the flavor
You all in the mix like a cup of Kool Aid
When I try to kiss ya
Put the sugar on my lips
I catch a fit, I'm not used to this
Can anybody tell me why?
Shortie got me feelin' high

[Chorus:]
You're my now and later
Since you're so good to me
Like a cherry flavor life saver
Please don't ever leave
Now and later girl
My candy girl
I can see gettin' close to you
Baby I want you all to myself

[Verse 2:]
They don't understand
I consider as my first real love
I know you're authentic first sure enough
From the rob into love
Baby you changed me
I feel good about you
Before the sugar rush I'd never doubt ya
I need you dealin' wit me not without me
So baby get in close to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You don't have to worry
Baby we got forever
To keep it grown
Baby it's a good thing
You're right here
And I am always cool with that
Candy coated love

[Breakdown:]
Put your hands up if you in the spot
Let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands down playin' around
Now let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands up if you in the spot
Let me see your now and later drop
Put your hands down if you wanna play around
I know you wanna see your now and later drop

[Chorus]
