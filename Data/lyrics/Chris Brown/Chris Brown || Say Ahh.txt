Yeah man
Its like this
You ready?

All the girls I know you're sexy
Take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs
When I look in your eyes

You Ready

All the girls I know you're sexy
Take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs
When I look in your eyes

All the girls I know you're sexy
Take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs
When I look in your eyes
Money ain't no thing to me little shawty
Cuz we gon' change them sheets when we naughty
Let me hear you say aah say aah

[Verse 1]
Baby, I got you pullin' on the covers
45 minutes in it and I'm still under
Bet I make thunder
Hurricane season wet drippin' on my face damn who turned on the sprinkler
Shawty, I love it when you're warm drop baby
Go girl!
And baby when I'm in it we goin' for the second round third round fourth round
Bad and you know it clap your hands
Might as well leave off your pants
I know what's about to happen now
Babygirl l-let me take you down take you down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm flyer than a spaceship so fresh so clean
Shorty wanna ride on my dream machine have her like (aaah)
You ain't gotta panic 
You wit' a sex mechanic
I jus' wanna be your friend
I don't wanna be ya man
I can have you feelin' legless Ms.Tenadin(?)
Sweep ya feet off the concrete
Lookin' like eye candy wanna rip it off when you screamin' "those are my panties!"
Shorty mine is official
Harder than a missle
Shorty givin' neckbone down to the gristle
I don't know if the drink or if she's a fan
All I know is that she 'bout to go to la la land
Wit' TBree in the back on the jeep
We bumpin' to CB I'm hittin' the lottery
What? ch in you ain't sippin' this here for free
My hustle so real gotchu caught up in the breezes

[Chorus]
