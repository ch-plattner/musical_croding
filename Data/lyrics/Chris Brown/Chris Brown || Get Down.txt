[Verse]
Rich nigga in the back seat of a ghost
Doin too much, doin the most
Wheels spinnin, cruise control
When the girls see me they lose control
I'ma gang spitter my mouth grab a milly
You ain't heard about me I got cloud round the city
Six 50 BMDub
When I step up in the spot they show me love

[Pre-Chorus:]
If you know what I'm sayin say
Ohhhh
If you know that I ain't playin say
Ohhhh
Just get them hands wavin babe
Then g-g-g-g-get down
G-g-g-g-get down

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
I hit the spot the girls, g-g-g-g-get down
Traveling around the world g-g-g-g-get down
Uh I know you like it girl g-g-g-g-get down
Just drop it to the floor you show me love
You know what you're doing baby
Get that body movin baby
Won't you back it up on me
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money in the air
You stay long enough
You gon see

[Verse]
Rich nigga, you know I'm gonna get it
Money stack it up and I'm about to buy city
Lady killer
Doggy want that kitty
I'm about to break her up
She nasty and she pretty
She got that pretty thang
That good good
Big ol' ass 
That good good
Six 50 BMDub
When I step up in the spot they show me love

[Pre-Chorus]
If you know what I'm sayin say
Ohhhh
If you know that I ain't playin say
Ohhhh
Just get them hands wavin babe
Then g-g-g-g-get down
G-g-g-g-get down

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]

Just drop it to the floor you show me love
You know what you're doing baby

You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money in the air
You stay long enough

[Verse: B.o.B]
Walking in the building feeling like I own the buildin
When we pull up to the front it's like an automotive dealer ship
Or something of the nature blowing blowing get the table
Please stop blowing my buzz I'm trying to bomb with mother nature
All you haters so played out
Yall so 1999
I'm so these ain't even out yet 
No you can't find these online
And all my passion forward just to go around
I got that lazy boy salary my pocket stay on recline
Everybody get down I'm throwing six out
Man I'm sayin 
I just roll like six pounds and blow that shit down
Man I'm sayin
If looks could kill she have the pistol in her purse
One to the dome
Like a ring shot
I get down

[Pre-Chorus]
If you know what I'm sayin say
Ohhhh
If you know that I ain't playin say
Ohhhh
Just get them hands wavin babe
Then g-g-g-g-get down
G-g-g-g-get down

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
I hit the spot the girls, g-g-g-g-get down
Traveling around the world g-g-g-g-get down
Uh I know you like it girl g-g-g-g-get down
Just drop it to the floor you show me love
You know what you're doing baby
Get that body movin baby
Won't you back it up on me
You keep wondering if I'ma throw this money in the air
You stay long enough
You gon see
