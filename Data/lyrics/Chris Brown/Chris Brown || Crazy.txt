Bout to buy the whole club where my credit card at
Money flying in the air, 
look at what I started
asses clapping up in here, 
damn its like an audience
and she bringing all her friends, 
I'll be yo seesaw
She bout to act an ass..heehaw
Got a stupid monkey fatter than King Kong,
It's like a pistol on you, 
take it all off
Ha, you gone need an ambulance, 
After you get done with this hammer in my pants,
Make it stand up, 
watch it dance, 
all mouth, no hands.

I tried to tell you niggers, 
I'm the greatest!
You bitch made hater
Shoes crocodile
fuck gators!
Ain't no need to talk

I'm about to go, go! go! (loco)
Go, go

Go, go! I'm about to go loco!
Go, go!

Look oh damn my liver
damn I got the shivers,
my family got that bomb weed.. but all i need is liquor
And then she got that butt, thicker than a snicker
And shawty got that fye, so i pop her like a blister (eww)
I know you think I'm losing it but why you speed ballin
Nigger I am cruisin bitch, nigga we ballin
And when I go to sleep, my tattoos come to life,
Hoes in your head, out of mind, out of site
That's why they call me breezy
baby, cold as ice
Boy don't make me paint a portrait, rearrange your life
all my kicks fly, they power ranger nikes
I'm the shit, 
Nigger ain't gotta say it twice
Tony the tiger, call me Tony!
Cause everything is great, was she twerkin on me!
Boy I ain't no kin ta ya
I am from Virginia, A F O nigger let go, 
Man they can't get rid of us?

I tried to tell you niggers, 
I'm the greatest!
You bitch made hater
Shoes crocodile
fuck gators!
Ain't no need to talk
nigger pay us!
I'm about to go, go! go! (loco)
Go, go 
my nigga just (crazy)
Go, go! I'm about to go loco!
Go, go!
that nigga just (crazy)
