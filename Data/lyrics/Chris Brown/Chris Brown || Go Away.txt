[Verse 1:]
Baby close your eyes and just
Take my hand and put your trust
In my heart I'll show you things you never seen before
Girl the world is full of hearts
But they never been this far
And galaxies calling on you and me
Just for one night girl, that's right

[Bridge:]
Hold on tight, don't let go
If you don't take the chance you'll never know
Moving faster now
Driving at the speed of light, the speed of sound

[Chorus:]
Go away ohh you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away ohh girl don't we get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Oh girl I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight

[Verse 2:]
I confess my love for you
As we stick a flag up on the moon
Baby I can honestly say
I can stay up here forever in a day

[Bridge:]
Hold on tight, don't let go
If you don't take the chance you'll never know
Moving faster now
Driving at the speed of light, the speed of sound

[Chorus:]
Go away ohh you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away ohh girl don't we get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Oh girl I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight

[Verse 3:]
I wanna fly away from here
But if you get lonely, we can fly away, away
All you got to do is hold me, we can go today, today

[Chorus:]
Go away ohh you'll be riding on the stars tonight
Go away ohh girl don't we get lost tonight
Don't you wanna go to the moon with me?
Oh girl I know you wanna go riding on the stars tonight
