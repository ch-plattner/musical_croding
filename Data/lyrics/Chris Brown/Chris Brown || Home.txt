
I wanna go back
I wanna go back to my home
I just wanna go back

I said
Is this life, is this my time to waste
I got all this money calling me, how the fuck I'ma turn it down
And I done fucked around and bought too many cars now
Baby I guess that I'm a superstar now
But I wish that I could go back
Cause that money don't mean a thing when
Everybody's changing

Crying with their hands out
What the fuck you want from me
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me
Fuck a one on one
I don't wanna do it
Wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back
From where I came from

And if I knew then what I know now
I would change so

Y'all niggas don't know niggas
Been here like an old nigga
When your girl see me she say Breezy you a cold nigga
Motherfuck the club
Tired of fake hoes and gold diggers
And while he tryna cuff your ass
Let go nigga
In 1999 most of y'all didn't know me
Tryna call me brodi
Nigga you ain't my homie
I'm tryna cash out everybody I came up with
But these cameras steady on that fuck shit

Crying with their hands out
What the fuck you want from me
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me
Fuck a one on one
I don't wanna do it
Wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back
From where I came from

And if I knew then what I know now
I would change so

I just wanna go back to freedom
Just take away all the bullshit and rewind the truth
Now everyday they wanna say shit
That's when I say fuck you
I'm super fly no laces
I could give a fuck about you
And they just hit me with the same old

Crying with their hands out
What the fuck you want from me
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me
Fuck a one on one
I don't wanna do it
Wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back
From where I came from

And if I knew then what I know now
I would change so
