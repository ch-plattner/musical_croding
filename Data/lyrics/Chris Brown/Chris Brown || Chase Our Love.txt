Believe it, I know 
That you won't 
And yes 
There's a feeling, We Both 
Need to know 
Let us start now 
It's that time 
So lets travel and see the light 

(And I'm) 
Gonna take you out 
Anywhere you wanna go now 
(If you ride) 
To the town 
Where we both can party now 

Drink in London 
Dance in Paris 
Let's Chase our love [x2]
Shout real loud now 
Let them hear us 
Let's chase our love [x2]

Til' morning 
Let us start now

So lets travel and see the light 

I'll watch you shine (shine)
