[Verse 1:]
Don't need your name, girl
Don't need your number
This might seem strange but, can't help but wonder what it would be like just to be with you
Don't need to move fast, just wanna think it through
Like how you hold me, and what you told me
Girl, you don't even know me
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Hook:]
Cause every time I'm lookin' in your eyes
Got me thinkin' bout you, wanna take you home
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want
I wanna find out what you like

[Chorus: x2]
You make me say oooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just wanna love yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo
Don't know what you dooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just lookin' at yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo

[Verse 2:]
I love the way you move, we're on the right track
Don't be a stranger, gal bring that ass back
Know who you came with, and I ain't tryna take his place
But you thinkin' bout leaving with me
It's written on your face
Like how you want me, how your body call's me
Girl, you don't even know me
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Hook:]
Cause every time I'm lookin' in your eyes
Got me thinkin' bout you, wanna take you home
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want
I wanna find out what you like

[Chorus: x2]
You make me say oooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just wanna love yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo
Don't know what you dooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just lookin' at yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo

[Bridge:]
Ohhhh-oh-oh-ohhhh, let me and you dance tonight
And ain't nobody else but me and your girl, girl
My eye's involved this time
Don't know what it is but...

[Chorus: x2]
You make me say oooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just wanna love yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo
Don't know what you dooooooo-oooo-oooo
Just lookin' at yoooooouuuu-oooo-oooo
