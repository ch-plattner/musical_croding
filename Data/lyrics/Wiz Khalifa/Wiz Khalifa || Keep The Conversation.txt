[Intro:]
Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong, just to have something to say
I know the moment is right
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high

[Verse 1:]
I seen you from afar
Nice frame and your braids long
Gucci bag matching your frames ma
And like a don I approached you
I'm not the player type
But if you play it right
Ma I'll coach you
I'll put it down how I'm spose to
A popular dude
But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you
Know a little bout the kid cause she's been watching my moves
Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news
And true
I been runnin' the town
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin
All of a sudden, wanting me know
Doing research and hunting me down
But never mind the stuntin'
Trying to see what's on your mind and something
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing
Have a wild discussion
I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it
Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear
Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air
To keep the conversation

[Chorus:]
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Right, you better know she get down, you know
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

[Verse 2:]
Here I go, putting myself out there
Really trying to see what shorty about here
Nothing to doubt here
See what you get
Get what you see
Me I keep it 100%
Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me
I'm like woah, slow down baby, and
Kick it with your man itta go down crazy
I wanna get to know ya
Talk to ya hold ya
And them places you ain't been
I wanna show ya
And she gone' let the kid handle his biz
Off of that smooth shit I kick in the air
They keep the conversation

[Chorus:]
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Right, you better know she get down, you know
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

[Verse 3:]
I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again
Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground
Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man whiz
Hit the club, Buy the bar, we let the champ fizz
Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas
Hard knocks University the heart of the campus
And you know I got my PHD
But that don't stand for player hating
That's a Pimpin Heavy Degree

[Chorus:]
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Right, you better know she get down, you know
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
