Yea buddy
I gotta cold n all that shit
Show ya'll how hard I work
I really go n man
It's from the heart n soul
Still havin fun tho too man
It's gon b a real big year
U watch I'm tellin u

[Chorus:]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Verse 1:]
I started off jus a fan writing like every other kid, grew up to be the man,
Paying bills at my mothers crib, everyday I'm hustlin, tryna get us out this situation,
Gotta deal with phony show goofy hoes n niggas hatin, mostly all embraces,
Small percentage of my city races, instead of doin good they rather c me catchin cases,
The fans love me but I struggle tryna impress the label,
An all this gotta feelin like isway to much up on the table, I'm still smoking outta O,
Sum speculations cus I'm hardly ever home, easy to say for how supose to move on,
Wen were goin threw depression an our brother Os gon, was told u gotta go threw hell to get the big thing,
An will u feel it can't get worse that's when shit change, obama president,
The stealers won the 6 six, so I ought ther tryna I fell like I can do anything

[Chorus:]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Bridge:]
Started small town, now were major,
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,

[Verse 2:]
Yea
Big city small town, cus wen your moneys up that's when they all round,
But the minute that u slip they dip, and there no one to depend on wen the chips fall down,
Me I never cut a corner short I follow protocall, got my focus on, took my notes in all,
This hard work gon pay off, the second that I'm rich I'll take a day off day off

[Chorus:]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Verse 3:]
Yea, yup,
If your out there on the grind, put your hands up n the sky, say we grinding, uh huh,
Aye, if u got it but u tryna get sum moe tell em boys that we climbin, this for my people,
Who no bout struggling, tryn get sumthing cus we came up from nothing,
Wat u n a rush for, it's all about timing, but soon as your on u know the limits the sky,

[Chorus:]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever
