
Early night jumping off the Porsche
Joint rich hoodie and sweats, smoking as good as it gets
Life of the party, know I get it started
I take a shot you take a shot, I roll a joint you roll a joint
Let's turn this spot into a after-party
Ain't heard about me you should ask somebody
We play the music off our iPhones
Gon' light that weed up, nobody home and plus were growing young nigga
With gin in this red cup turning up cause' we don't give a fuck
And only ones that gets us is us
Toking 'till I'm glaze, rolling smoking blaze
Rock expensive J's, glad I brought my shades
Got a bottle somebody gave me, and another one I saved that I bought on the way

And that's faded, pour a shot cause' we made it
Two shots if you're feeling good, middle finger if you hate it
Got fly as I wanted to
Got high as I wanted to
Couldn't lie if I wanted to
Couldn't drive if I wanted to

I got two shots another one poured
'Bout to roll a joint and it's going down
I got Bombay at the bottom of my cup
Faded but I got enough to go around
I got shoes on you can't find em in the store
Pound of weed you can smell it by the door
Palm trees you can have this all season
I'm balling and the niggas running with me
Is ready for whatever [x4]
