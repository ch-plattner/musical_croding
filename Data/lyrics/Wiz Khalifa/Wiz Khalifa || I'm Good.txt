[Verse 1:]
Yeaa

Yea
Fresh fit new chucks (new chucks)
I swear I feel like a million bucks (million bucks)
And dem leather seats feel like plush (uh-huh)

20 carrots got your bitch goin nuts
Livin like a star so dey get so struck
Far as rap got dis shit sowed up
Ridin by myself couple sticks rolled up
Yeaaaa
On dese frames I done spent so much
Niggas wanna nip so da fo fifth on tuck
And jus look don't touch

Got a future so bright u'll see

In my shoes yea dey might wanna be
Da cameras right here and da lights on me
Let's Go

[Chorus:]

Livin jus da way I should
Most niggas ain't think I could
Look homie I'm good

But I'm livin jus da way I should

[Verse 2:]
Yea
More cars more clothes
Get money dats da life I chose
Chase money nigga y chase hoes
Dey ain't even want me till my neck got froze
And da price got told
Stories by trips in da nice sized homes
It's a game play da life I kno
On the winnin end wen the dice got rolled
Yea
Tall nigga so my flights got room
Small nigga so I always got goons
Say u get a lil cash dats cool
I prolly spent more than dat on tattoos
I got da formula ya need 2 find
My city on lock and da keys r mine
So u can gon keep ya piece of mind cause I'm G 2 O's and a D with mine
Let's Go

[Chorus]
