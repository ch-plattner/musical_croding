I dont know whats going on, or about this feelin, you got me feelin,
Cuz everytime I try to leave I'm right back again, yea,
And I aint goin no where, you got me walkin on the ceilin,

So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone, oh,
Ill be the one you call, no tellin where we might go,
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there, flyin in the air,
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spent the night...low...

It go up up up up up up up up 
We go up up up up up up up up, 
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up

So high I'm not comin down, and you wit me you aint comin down eitherrrr,
Lets write our names on a cloud, break sum down,
Roll it up and pass it all around, god dam she a keeeperrr, yea,

So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone,
Ill be the one you callllll, no tellin where we might go,
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there flyin in the air,
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spend the night...low

It go up up up up up up up up 
We go up up up up up up up up, 
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up

Cuz everythings better when your high,
Everythings better when your high,
Everythings better when your high,
Everythings better when your high,
If you dont smoke I dont kno why

Cuz everythings better when your high,
Everythings better when your high,
Everythings better when your high,
If you dont smoke I dont kno why

Keep all that....even keep that too,
And keep that too but you cut this out.....
Kush and orange juice nigga...
