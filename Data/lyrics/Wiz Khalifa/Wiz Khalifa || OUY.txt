
O-U-Y, yea, talking to you
Umhm
28 Grams

I ain't tryna hear about all them other niggas
I just want, I just wanna come over and have
Ugh, heard he ain't a real nigga
Call me I'm a come feel you up
Like a real nigga

Cause when lights go out, we're all alone
I don't see no one
Ride slow
I won't let nobody know
Ooh, who you are
Be who you are
Be who you are

I want you, you
I want you
As bad as you are
Why would you wanna fuck with a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna roll weed for a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna throw the ass for a nigga like me girl?
Grind on it when you throw that ass for a nigga like me?

You, you, you, you, know what you want
You remember where you came from
Oh yea, you know the business
I swear that pussy is the business
Might give your ass the business
You, you, ugh

We going away, she ridin' for the kid
Ridin' for the squad, ridin' on his dick
Go in the wind, gone with the wheel
Gone off that liquor, she going to my crib
Phone blowin' up, kush coned up
Sheets all wet, hair messed up
Tied around my neck
Face on deck
Just let a nigga know what it is
I still want you
Yea I want you
Nigga want you
You! For real

Yea, bitch
28 Grams
We in the trap all day
I'm trappin' like motherfuckin' uh
Young Jeezy, you know, Snowman days
That's me right now, whippin'
