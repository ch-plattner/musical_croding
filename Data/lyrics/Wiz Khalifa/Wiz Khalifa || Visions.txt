Life.... Looking out the window. Kush and Orange Juice Nigga 
You Might want uh burn one to this. 

[Verse 1] 
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 in a halfs even if you had a chance. 
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad. 
Its all part of the plan.
To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged. 
Packing my over night carry on, we dont check bags. 
Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes. 
True story word to the wise dont let these labels gas you up to be somethin.
Get yo paper never trust em. 
Watch the niggas you run with.
I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit. 
& make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption. 
The difference between you guys is you lie & we live it.
In the sky so pay us a visit. 
Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it. 

[Wiz Talking] 
What you aint you trying to eat nigga. 
COME ON, fuck is you waiting for. 
Nigga time just sitting around man. COME ON. 
Everything was all good. Now shit real. 

[Verse 2] 
Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume. 
Smoking cigars shit was fool.
Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that how fly tune. 
Sucker shit we just cant excuse 
Steady trying to duplicate but they aint us. 
Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up. 
Paparazzi taking pictures we famous 
Held my city down like a anchor.
Now its champagne we drink. 
Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink.
I love her attitude she love tracing my ink. 
I get up in the wind. Leave her with something to ease stress. 
The best not just regular visions. 
Let you get a glimpse of how I'm living, HD 
Young Khalifa gettin to the money safe key. 

[Wiz Talking] 
Matter fact hit this. 
You cold nigga I got a coat in the trunk. 
Come on man leave that bullshit alone man. 
Its over for that.
Put this coat on.
