[Chorus:]
Uh huh, Uh huh
Should I stay or should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah

Should I stay or Should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I wanna call my girlfriend, but she's all mad
Everything was good then, now she's all bad
I hit your phone up, you never call back
Would I be wrong if I took everything I bought back
Me and you against the world girl, I thought that
I'd be able to see them signs, no contract
So high off of life, will make a hater catch a contact
But now I treat her like I'm jumping out a plane and fall back
Yeah, cause I can only dream of what we had
Try to work, but seems we go wrong
Sometimes I pray to God, you take me back
Then run and tell the homies I've moved on
But soon as I get my head right
You gon' think I'm stuck and I'm just frontin', no headlights
Put you in the club and bought you stuff you never wear twice
Now the thrill is gone and the decisions in the air like, Damn

[Chorus:]
Should I stay or Should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah
Play it on the radio woah woah
