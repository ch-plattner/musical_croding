Empty bottles of Clicquot (CLEE-Co) and ashes on the flo'.
Towel under the do', we wasn't supposed to even smoke.
I ain't trippin, never slip or slackin on my pimpin.
Drop the nerd you with,come smoke a joint with he who's winnin.
Ain't like them guys who wine and dine to keep they women
My bitches only want two things, that's to get high and kick it
Try my pot prescription, take a couple shots with lemon.
Usually have to watch a movie to see how I'm livin.
(Yea) So what's the hold up, waiter bring the bottle get them EZ- Widers rolled up.
Self made G', did everything on my own bra'.
In my early twenties with money as wide as Oprah.

[Chorus:]
Crack another bottle get the weed rolled up (weed rolled up),
and girl you know I got it everything's on us everything's on us
I'm talkin' alot cause I'm getting bankroll (bank roll),
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh uh-ohhhh).
Say she never been (never been)
Say she never been (never been)
Say she never been (never been)
I'm getting bank roll(bank roll),
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh).
Say she never been (never been).

(Uhh) Crack a window we gon' smoke this Indo.(indoor)
Saying that you still high from last night.
You try to pass, trying to beware of the fast life.
Kick it with the planes and it'll be your last flight.
(Yea) OG hash, let you stumble to class right.
The sex great, no I don't give her no half-pipe.
Housekeepers knocking, we don't let em' in
Rollin doobies up, room with a jacuzzi tub.
(SAY SHE NEVER BEEN)
In the game, I am a veteran.
After we fuck, roll the doctor prescribed medicine.
Let you hit it once, then you sleeping
A fly nigga traveling the world, takin yo girl for the weekend.
Peep it.

[Chorus:]
Crack another bottle get the weed rolled up (weed rolled up),
and girl you know I got it everything's on us everything's on us
I'm talking a lot cause I'm getting bankroll bank roll
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh uh-ohh).
Say she never been (never been)
Say she never been (never been)
Say she never been (never been)
I'm getting bank roll(bank roll),
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh).
Say she never been (never been).
