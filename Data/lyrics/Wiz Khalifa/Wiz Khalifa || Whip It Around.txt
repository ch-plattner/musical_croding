Is that air is that drop
Is that... outside the pot
Is that whip it whip it whip it
Whip it whip it watch it...
Is that loud? Is that stupid loud?
I can't hear a sound
I am in the club
You can't see me
I ain't never coming down
Is my swags out the frame
In my own lame
Had a bad bitch she's off the chain
And my hustle pay stupid
You all know how I do it
Keeping shit one hundred
No stocking in my music
They say I am back foolish
I can show you how I do this
I am fly by the haters
I took them...
My flow is optimistic
I pay for my own pictures
They say they don't believe it
I say go ask...

Whip it whip it around [repeats]

I am counting paper rolling paper
Watching time fly
California breaks I am...
Me I am sky high
My bitch down on earth
Money in the bank
... roller in her purse
And I ain't... in the job...
Show love and the diamonds of my neck
Make these whores trust
On the role... model whores
... good nigger whit friends
I ain't got to talk much give me brains
Cause she said she has expensive tastes
Let her rob my tattoos...

Whip it whip it around [repeats]
