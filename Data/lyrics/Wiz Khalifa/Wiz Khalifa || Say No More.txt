Say no more
Say no more
Say no more
Don't say nothin'
Tell her don't talk about it
Just be about it
Don't talk about it
Just be about it
Don't say nothin'

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
First I'm a roll up, then pour up
Then we goin' fuck, she know what's up
I'm a make you cum, bout' two or three times
Then I'm a get mine, yeah I'm a get mine
Girl run it back
Straight drop, bet you get on top
And I'm a just watch
I'm a smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine
Smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine

[Hook]

They said it's the end of the world today
So I'm a let it be known
When I'm inside you, it's my favorite place
Park my ride where your heart's at, that's home
Your legs are shakin' your lips are cold
You're out of body, you're in control
Start up my ride, roll up that weed
You don't smoke so hand me a light
I don't drink and drive but I watch you takin' them shots
And get faded, say your life's a bitch, you hate it
Who gives a fuck about money, on material shit, life's wasted
Can't count how many thousand couches we done laid in
Who knows how many hotel rooms we done stayed in
When I'm late coming home or what, you already know what's up
Don't even call my phone, just come

[Hook]

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine [x5]
I told her
[Wiz Khalifa:]
You deserve what you get in this world that we live in
Know your purpose I heard you been hurt before, you're lying there again
Playing caution to the wind
What you want is in front of you
Games are meant to be played yeah
But you, well you ain't far from your own star
We in our own world
Doing grown things but still feeling like kids
Let the past be the past
It was what it was, now it is what it is
No fears in the world

Say no more
Say no more
Say no more
