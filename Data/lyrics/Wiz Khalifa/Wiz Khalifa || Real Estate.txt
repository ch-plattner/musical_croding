[Intro]
Ugh
ya’ll already know what it is man
If they wanna know my name, they look up and see the gang
Ugh, its not a problem, we spending change

[Verse 1]
Got the pedal to the medal when I pull up out the garage
they feelin ‘em at all, these niggas a mirage
handling my biz like a full body of massage, hands on
niggas gon hate, hoes wanna menage
cops fuck wit me hopin to get a charge
hoes leaving their man, fuckin us cause our cars
if its one thing I know, its smokin and living large
got me speedin down the interstate
see what I’m eatin, wanna piece up off my dinner plate
hey she fuckin me cause how I win a race
plus I aint cheap, I roll the reefer counting bigger cake
wait I’m talkin fast car, big estate
money come in cash plus in the bank
nigga don’t believe me, throw it in your face
bitch I'm in the building like real estate

[Chorus]
They say I’m still the same
you know it aint a thang
Beside the zip code aint a damn thang changed
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming
Might crack a smile but aint a damn thang funny, nooo, noooo, uh ha
I’m straight, when you gettin money muthafukas gonna hate
find the baddest bitch and get her number,
I dont even call her (call her, call her)
feel like a million dollars

When they make it,
they should put my face up on a million dollar bill
dollar bill, dollar bill
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
when they make it,
they should put my face up on a million dollar bill
dollar bill, dollar bill
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
cause thats how I feel yup
hey

[Verse 2]
Ballin’s not a hobby, its my occupation
hoes on my dick, thats my confirmation
couple stars with me, thats a constelation
Jacksons, Grants, Benjys, thats my conversation
touch the pedal once, it look like I’m racing
eyes chinese, smoke like I’m jamacian,
V.I.P rollin’ doobies up and face it
12 bottles of Rose, I’m on some gang shit
gettin all the shit, cake crumblin
aint nothin, told them lil niggas I take from ‘em
laughin my all the way to the bank
tried to talk but they can’t
they just stand there when they starin
hatin, mumblin,
what you make a year, I guarantee I spend it clubbin
started kinda hot, now its safe to say we bubblin
400 on a zip, blow it all day
another city, state, another mill to make

[Chorus]
