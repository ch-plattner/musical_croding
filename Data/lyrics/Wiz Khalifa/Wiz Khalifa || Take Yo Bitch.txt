Yeah, you ever just know 
that you was finna splack another nigga's bitch up
like, you see a bitch she be with a nigga
and you be knowing she be thinking to herself like I wish I was with that nigga

[Chorus:]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) 
then I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch

yo bitch like me and I don't know her 
all up on me at the show I'm tryin' to control her 
you hatin' from afar she tryin' to get closer 
sittin' with me at the bar and tryin' to be sober 
no sir, so you come and kick it with my clique 
ya nigga somewhere heated screamin' that's my bitch
I'm tatted up rich, them bitches understand 
when you makin' money talk, everyone know you the man 
with my Hollywood hoes, or somewhere by the sand 
fuck your shit up with your nigga tryin' to fit me in your plans 
tell em' you're a fan, now you're at my crib 
used to like my music now he's saying fuck young wiz
and that's how I live and I won't change for the world 
make ya man feel like u 'gon need a chain for ya girl 
says she been searchin' round for some change in the world 
I'm doin' shit that you not so I'm lookin' like Barack to her.

[Chorus:]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) 
then I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired (jerz) of fightin' and runnin' round (wizzle) with the same nigga (neako)
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (tell you a story)
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch

I see you stressin' my nigga now tell me what is going on
Somebody took ya bitch
I guess you want to grab the ratchet go hit his hood and do him wrong
all over your chick
look at lil' rick baby bro no he ain't comin' home
because the nigga straight flipped
a nigga hit his bitch re-tripped then he hit him in his dome
he got a life sentence
you might want to think about what you're doing before you do it wrong
when you shoot don't miss
cause if you do niggas'll catch you and baby bro they ain't wrong
if they put you in the ditch 
I'ma tell you like this, life is priceless
Because you took a shot don't mean it gon' miss
You never knew another nigga sent ya wife the dick
and now you sittin' back with a chick like this

[Chorus:]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) (I see ya man)
then (yeah) I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired (neako) of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga (khalifa I got you bro)
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (yeah)
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
