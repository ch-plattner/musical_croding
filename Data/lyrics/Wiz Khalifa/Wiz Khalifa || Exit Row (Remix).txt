[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I don’t mean to be rude
But every since I ran into you
I’ve been thinking about things I wanna do
I told you I’ve got a room, well
You said you tryna come through
And if ya girl trippin’ than bring her too

Cause I, I aint gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Cause I, I aint gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
One for the money, two for the show
Three rooms, four chicks who brought pounds to smoke
Five times in your city, now your town should know
Six bottles waiting, Seven time
And you know me, I’m VIP smoking tropical
Love the way my diamond shining like Mop and Go

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Take off, take off
She ready for take off
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off

And I live fast like the brakes off
Bigger cake in my bank bitch, bake-off
Your pockets on E, weight loss
My goons on top of the beef, steak sauce
And when I’m in the club I blind them hoes like Ray Charles
Used to be your old lady but you got laid off

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trailblaza]
Life's good when your team is great and your chick is badder
Take her home-run, cause if she see my cake you goin' have to grab her
I had to remind her, don't check the skies I know it's clear
So grab your girls, grab your bags, and bring your pretty ass over here
That's so sincere - uh, that's how I meant it
The clouds are tremendous hop on the flight for tonight bring a couple attendants
Watch me kick my feet up, behind the cloud baby girl we should meet up
I don't need no trees but roll that leaf for wiz khalifa
I can't hear you speak up - they say I changed
Make's sense, I'm making change Underdawgs x Taylor Gang
Start the engine, feel the flame
A lot of woman, too much champagne
Time is money, that's why these dimes with us
Come meet the pilots honey, that g goin be shocked that his time is up!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
