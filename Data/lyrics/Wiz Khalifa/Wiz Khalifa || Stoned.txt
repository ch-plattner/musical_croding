[Hook]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

[Verse 1]
And I remember back in the day
Before I thought about gettin’ paid
The ladies ain’t wan’ give me no play
The haters ain't have nothin’ to say
They never let me into the club
The radio ain’t show me no love
Gave my all, but it just wasn’t enough
And complaining too, it’s just how it was
And now I’m just posted
With my baddest bitch and we just kick it in this villa watchin’ pictures gettin roasted
Vision gettin’ clearer yea she open
But her eyes low, never under the clouds baby we floatin’

[Hook - 2x]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

[Verse 2]
I started coming up in the game
And people started knowin’ my name
They tried to put me into that lane
And we had to go our separate ways
Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin I ain’t puttin it out
Smokin loud
And all my peoples got champagne, fast cars by the bar wasted
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wanna taste it
Horses in my car, little Louis on my bracelet
When you live just like a star it feels so amazing

[Hook - 2x]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

Uh high but I’m focused one thing they know is
(If you rollin wit tha gang, then you rollin up another plane)
Ok no stems, no seeds I keep it G
(If you rollin’ wit’ tha gang, then you rollin up another plane) [2x]
And them lame niggas get dissed I let that bad bitch twist
(If you rollin up tha gang, then you rollin wit another plane) [3x]
