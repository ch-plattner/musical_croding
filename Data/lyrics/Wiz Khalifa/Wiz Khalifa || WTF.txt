If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything
What we doing (Getting money)
How we do it (Errday)
Order case tell bar tender we need 30 more
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck then What The fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for

You know me no I don't my nig a be about it
Can't even count it, Need an accountant
I'm rich so now my bitch is bad I need a stallion
Ain't trickin I just treat her like she need allowance
Smoke the whole pound "Man we gone need an Island"
Keep my toys in the garage so bitches think I'm childish
Oh I got money you could keep your talent
Ye ain't even getting money you just be around it
Engine screaming when I run it,
Wakin neighbors when I'm coming
Here em talking but they don't want it them nigguhs frontin
Smokin loud they shit you smoke ain't sayin nothing
Them nigguh talking shit but they ain't sayin nothing

If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything
What we doing (Getting money)
How we do it (Errday)
Order case tell bar tender we need 30 more
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck then What The fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for

Diamonds all up in my chain it's like an ambulance
Nigguh tryna race my car, man he don't stand a chance
Everything is all on us that mean you gotta know
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck that mean you gotta go
Drinkin liquor smoking weed and ballin everday
Mean money fuckin hoes I'm repping Taylor Gang
That nigguh, they tellin me that I'm that nigguh
Like the rooms full of white folks, I'm that nigguh
If ye ain't talkin money I can't even rap which ya
Major cake but nigguhs hate because my stacks bigger
Raw papers, law ones
Fuckin with them Taylors boy you got the wrong one

If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything
What we doing (Getting money)
How we do it (Errday)
Order case tell bar tender we need 30 more
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck then What The fuck you in here for
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
