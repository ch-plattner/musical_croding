[Intro: Wiz Khalifa (Nicki Minaj)]
Taylor Gang, let's get it
(Young Money)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
There's some people coming with me and I know who they are
And some that ain't gon' make it and I know who they are
And I know they ain't gon' like it but it's quite alright
I ain't need no one my whole life, and I done alright
I can do bad by myself, these days you never can tell
But the people who been with me and they know who they are
Yeah they know my true colors and they see what they are

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it
And that green inside they hide it, cause that's they true colors
When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty
And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
All I do is smoke weed and get paid
That jealousy I can see in they face
That green is all that I make, call it fate
Or call me perfect with timing
Call me crazy, don't call my phone
Call me covered with diamonds
Call me boss man, young Khalifa man
I was on the ground when y'all wasn't sticking to the plan
Learn the game just like the back of my hand
Back in demand, back with them bands
She on her back, back of the Benz (God damn)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I said, "Baby we made it", even though niggas hated
Did everything I stated, I am so innovative
All my girls getting faded and all my whips candy painted
Call me Nicki M. Ali, these bitches know I'm the greatest
Cause I pull up in the white
Pull up with the black
Pull up in the back
Pull up with some niggas that be yellin' back
Have the hella best fans, hella wet sands, hella jet plans
Married to the game they don't need a best man
They know I'm a mogul for real
I branded a color, pink is the color
Can't wait to unveil the pink print cover

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Yeah, yeah cause that's my true colors
Yeah, yeah cause that's my true colors
When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it
And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Always been, always was
The one who win, ain't tryna take a loss
Counting faces, spending faces
Being faceless, look at they faces
Real that's my true colors
Rich that's my true colors
If you a real nigga, let's get it, let's get it
If you a rich nigga, let's get it, let's get it

[Hook]
