[Curren$y:]
By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit
Niggas suspended from the ceiling
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling
Got a low rise in Venice
Mami you got the vision and I see it HD
And it couldn't be any clearer
You should be with Spitta
And you know that this your chance, don't blow it like birthday candles
Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals
It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals
Bottles pop, back to back
Extra large chronic sack
Cellphone, camera's out
Mama I remember that
Anytime I look at that
I go to wondering where you at
So baby where you at
With it
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
And maybe we get back up in a minute

[Chorus: x2]
Fast cars
Fly clothes
G5's flying on the seashores
Get it
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't
With it
(Yeah)

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Listen, if you with it, get in
What you sipping
Hit it out of the park
That's if you pitching
First you look at me wrong
Like uh uh, no he didn't
Then you turn into rubbing on me
You start to give in, get it
By the beach, watching tennis
Crack another bottle of Perignon
Louis V carry-ons when you visit
Sending all them singles in your sidekick sentence
Then I reply like be there in a minute
Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list
The weed come from a village
Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit
From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste
We lighting reefer bumping 808's & heartbreaks
Skinny broad but out them jeans she got a heart shape
Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race
And let you bet it all keep the winnings
Young entrepreneur give you the business, dig it (Yeah)

[Chorus: x2]
Fast cars
Fly clothes
G5's flying on the seashores
Get it
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't
With it
(Yeah)
