If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh
And we can go (go), go (go), go (go), go, yeahhh

Jump off in my ride (ride), I'll smoke somethin' good with you
You just what I like (like), go back to the hood with you
T.V.'s in the dash, bass jumpin' out my sub-woofer
My hands goin' up your thigh (thigh), I'm harder than a Scud missile
Got nowhere to go (go), my crib or to the hotel
Fuck it we gon' ride (ride), this ray is smokin' so well
Plus you lookin' right (right), hair down wit' your pearl nails
Shorty got a man (man), I guarantee she won't tell
Now we super high (high), the whip is movin' slow-mo
She went up and down (down), yankin' like a yo-yo
I was in my zone (zone), she was gettin' hot
She said (fuck me right now), I just lean and stop (stop)
Pulled off to the side (side), jumped up in my backseat
She turned to a pro (pro), fuckin' like a athlete
Like it from the front (front), take it from the side (side)
Didn't know this what she meant, when she said she wanna ride (let's ride)

If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh
And we can go (go), go (go), go (go), go, yeahhh

Windows rolled down (down), plus my leather's so soft
Pull em' to the side (side), no need to take your clothes off
Call my nigga Kev (Kev), tell him how the pound went
Said he got a thorough-bread bitch to put me down with
I say that's a bet (bet), just let me roll this green up
Go pick up the girl (girl), park it then I steam up
She looked at my neck (neck), I swear she caught a fever
Her pussy got wet (wet), I swear I need a (feema[?])
Said she wasn't a freak but (but) she was down to try things
And she got my ringtone, picture on her myspace
Music on bang (bang), Mami gettin' anxious
Heard I got the juice (juice), she probably wanna taste it
Fuck with baby girl, baby girl ain't on no fake shit
Said it's goin' down (down), down is where her face went
[?] just how my chain lit, they slide with me
(Stay with) Stay with somethin' serious, in my ride with me (let's ride)

If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh
