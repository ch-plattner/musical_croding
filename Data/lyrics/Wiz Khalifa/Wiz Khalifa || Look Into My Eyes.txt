[Verse 1:]
It ain't hard to tell I got money 
You can see it if you're blind 
You can see it when it shine, 
you see it then it's mine 
Always on my hustle, 
always on my grind 24/7, 365 
Came up off the corner, quarters nickels and dimes
Nigga don't believe me, look into my eyes 
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives 
Niggas doing time, they just tryna' survive 
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine 
Broke and rich nigga, it's a very thin line 
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed I'm getting high 
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em' if you try 
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's 
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind 
Got some niggas that I'm cool with, some gangster ass ties
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling

[Hook:]
Shades on so them haters can't
look into my eyes Look into my eyes, look into my eyes 
So high that they say it's hard to look into my eyes 
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes 
You'll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes 
You gon' see a real nigga when you look into my eyes 
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes

[Verse 2:]
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive 
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes 
So many people in my business I'm just trying to live my life 
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes 
See them kay kay clouds floating when you look into my ride 
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes 
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right 
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent a boss 
I got my own shit, breeze holding on that chrome shit 
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit 
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open 
We all know that the bullshit be talking and the real shit be walking
It's a 9-11 I'm parking you ain't getting money that's awkward 
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes 
Niggas faking but I can't I don't look good in that disguise.

[Hook]
