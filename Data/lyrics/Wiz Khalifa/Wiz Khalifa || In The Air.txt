[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You’ve been lost with them rookies
Young Khalifa on this pro shit
So sick of standin still I could get you in motion
Trips out in the sand 
Rollin swishers by the ocean
Toastin, private seats on the cloud and we ghostin
Used to play the low
Now you can’t help but get noticed
Startin to get approached and your 
Girlfriends gettin nosey
Still you hold me down, 
Hold me down ain’t ‘fraid to show it
I know she someone I can grow with

[Chorus: K-Young]
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go
Girl I wanna know,
Would you tell me a lie? No
If you ever leave my side, no
Would you play with my time? No
If you rider put em 
In the air [x12]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Tell me what’s your name
Here’s my number you can call me
Can’t deal with a wife
But you can be my little shorty
I can be your star 
We can kick it out in orbit
Or get done with this, 
Flip somewhere and record it
Says she got a man, 
But her man she gettin bored with
Love me cause I grind,
She don’t mind where I be tourin
Don’t got lots of time, therefore
I can’t be your boyfriend
I’m more than in the air, soarin

[Chorus: K-Young]
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go
Girl I wanna know,
Would you tell me a lie? No
If you ever leave my side, no
Would you play with my time? No
If you rider put em 
In the air [x12]

[Bridge: K-Young]
I won’t be excited to sit at home
Waitin to hear the phone ringin
No, oh, oh, I won’t
Even though I’m in love with you
Yes I’m in love with you
Girl I’m hopin that forever we’ll be tight now
Let me put in on the table for you right now

[Chorus: K-Young]
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go
Girl I wanna know,
Would you tell me a lie? No
If you ever leave my side, no
Would you play with my time? No
If you rider put em 
In the air [x12]
