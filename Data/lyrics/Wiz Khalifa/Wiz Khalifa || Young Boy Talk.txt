One war, one phone call is how I handle you. {whew}
On the grind, you pussy niggas hate, bitch I'm out in diferent states bought the ticket gettin cake.
Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them dolla signs,
run with them niggas holdin glocks like its Columbine. {Pop, Pop, Pop}
I'ma star in detroit so I gotta shine, far as Pittsburgh I'm the voice so I gotta Rhyme. {Yaaaa}
Rhymen all the time, ever since the first day.
now I'm gettin cake like ay day became my birthday.
Somethin like an earthquake, the way the shit drop, I be at the tip top, postin with a big knot.
You ain't know me hoe, you sit at home and just watch, less than hatas, stone cold spectatas.
