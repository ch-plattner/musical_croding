If I said it I meant it nigga...

We all in

Hahaha everything's taylord

And fuck it we ain't got to go to the store no more,
Got my own papers baby girl, feelin get my own weed too,
Get you a pound let you roll that shit,

Uh, I'm rollin up the windows while I'm smokin weed,
Drivin through my town like I don't know the speed,
Countin so much paper I can't fold it up,
Bad bitch, she suck me while I'm rollin up,
Ya bitch, you probably see me everywhere,
Money long now my house got tv's everywhere,
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat screen,
New bitch, look nothing like my last fling,
Ridin in the maserati nigga no shirt,
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it wont work,
Camo shorts on like a general, 
Mind on a mill, blowin on medicinal,

I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnnnnn, yeahhh
Hustlinnnnn, yeahhhhhhh
[repeat 2x]

Been through every nigga town never had a problem,
Young millionaire, never had a job though,
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground,
As long as your money up she said its goin down,
Brought her home girl, said that she don't do friends,
Kick the bitch out and make her find new friends,
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims,
745 for a new benz,
I take everyday and live like its the weekend,
Doin it all if you ain't ballin take a seat then,
If I said it I meant, throw a stack at that bitch ass,
Let her pay her rent with it,

I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnn, yeahhhh
Hustlinnn, yeahhhh
[repeat 2x]
