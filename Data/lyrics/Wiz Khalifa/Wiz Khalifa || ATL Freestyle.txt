Three cell phones, pennslyvania plates.
Hold up, hold up, hold up I said,
Life's good, so I'm feeling great call me out of town shawty every week a different state.
Three cell phones, pennslyvania plates on a 4 month run tryna get my money straight.
I'm bout cake, it keep the world turning, hundred thousand dollar earning while I'm big JOINT burning.
And to these hoes Ima pimp like iceberg, probably hurt your feelings if I told you what the ice worth.
A couple grand, I'll hit you with a nice verse, kush when I land mix it in when I light purp.
And I light purp, I fuck with kush more niggas talking wreckless I'll exepect that's what the hoods for.
What up Hazelwood? Nigga oowoo I'm a rap experimenting era like a blue tooth,
and my money all old but my shoes new, all these karats got your girl open like a moon roof.
Nigga who you? Nigga who we? We the Taylor Gang they be like oowee.

I keep a groupie hoe, always got a group of dough, all up in my pocket,
I don't need a wallet, rubberbands popping, yall niggas ain't getting stacks,
