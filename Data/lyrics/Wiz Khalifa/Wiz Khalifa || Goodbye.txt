
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

I worked for everything I own
Dare a nigga try and take it
Take 300 on the frames
Just from blocking out you haters

Swear they're in my way
They in my rear view mirror
If a nigga act stupid
I'ma let him get his issue

Everything designer
And my back seat's reclining
Got a thing for looking good
And blowing money like it's tissue

But niggaz see you eating
Get to starving for a plate
Well, you don't give it when they hate
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit

It's no gimmick
I talk it how I live it
So when a nigga cross the finish
Gotta push it to the limit

Got a mom and little sister
I plan on taking care of
Lost my uncle this year
Couple niggas in the system

So I roll
No telling where I'm landing
But I know something
That I'm going towards the money

I can see you niggas slacking
Everyday I'm on my job
Yung Khalifa going hard
Till the I'm last man standing

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

Got my eyes on this money
And some good weed burning
Buying from ya, you got it grand
Going hard is not an option

Now these niggas acting jealous
'Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When it's big shit popping

??
Gotta keep it in my system
60 box of Cigarellos
'Cause I blow it by the onion

Pack up some dollar bills
Send some paper to my younging
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets

Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the medal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point of getting settled

Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
You think it's my cologne
But it's money that you smelling

Eyes like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
'Cause of funny niggas telling

Nigga, I'ma be grinding
Till the day that I expire
I've been running through the batch
Till I'm the last man standing

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
