Yeah! (Two!) [5x]
Yeah! Two-Up!
Uh

They call me young boy, young crack
Brought up where them slums at
Hustle, I done done that
Customers I brung back
Just cause how I sung raps
Some of them are [?] crack
[?] only some will let their gun clap
Me, I'm on a cash chase, I'm running where them funds at
Rolling up the L and put something where my lungs at
Money come in dumb stacks, niggas lookin hungry and they wonder where they lunch at
I already come for that
I ain't find comfort at, any spot less than the top
You niggas had it but ya records done flop
So I picked it up and ran with the rock
And I ain't gotta sing it on the cards for you to understand that I'm hot
I just face one, stand up and rock, I give my hat a good cock
To the side and do my damngity-bop
I'm the man to be watched, or the nigga to see
If you want it, then I got it, you can get it from me

I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)

Should I feel bad cause niggas sold you a dream
Now Young Khalifa I'm controlling the scene
I ain't roll with ya team, did my own little thing
Now the records I be making got me holding the cream
And I'm only a teen, got respect like a man though
But all the real niggas say they love how ya man flow
Love how I'm repping the Burgh at every damn show (412)
Sit back, puff on the herb, countin my damn dough
Smile in my face, doubt ya kid on the down low
They ain't believe it before, them fuckers now know
But now though, you see through like a plate of glass
Tryna hide, I see you with ya hating ass
I'm bout making cash, haze by the ?? bag
Me and sledgren switch the swag just to make em mad
And niggas watchin my moves, so I'm make em fast
I'm first up, you out of luck, and takin last

I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
