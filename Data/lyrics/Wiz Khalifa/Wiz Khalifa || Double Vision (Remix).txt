[Rap: Wiz Khalifa]
On nights like this
Gotta pour something
Get right like this
They don't write like this
Hear them talk it up
But they ain't quite like this
And I'm light type rich
Hundred on the chain
With the light bright right wrist
And my pipes like vroom vroom
That's why your chick wanna come with him
All my homies ballin above the rim
My pockets bulging a lump sum
You can come if you want
Just bring a friend

[Chorus: 3Oh! 3]
'Cause there's so many fine woman that my head is spinning
And I've lost all feeling everybody's singing like
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na

'Cause there so many fine woman that my head is spinning
And I'm seeing double vision everybody's singing like
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na na

Let's do this outside
Shut down the whole block
Watch the girls drop by like it's a catwalk
We're livin' easy
We got the whole day
And we can go hard don't matter what the cops say

I'm thinking maybe I can't have relationships
'Cause lately they're not making any sense
And baby your the one thing on my mind that can change anytime

[Chorus]

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
My red cup overflowing
The bartender tell me stop
I just keep on going
I don't even have to talk about it
I just show it
Umm it's me they want to roll with
Don't need to know her name
Cause now she sleeping in my home
Drink by the case beer glass cup
I'm at the bar spending cash up
And I probably told you this was my last one
But I'm trying to get trashed bro

[3Oh! 3:]
I see not vitals on your EKG
Dead on the dance floor B.O.B
Clap because we need more 3OH! 3
Blowing out your speakers
Hey, na na na
Blowing out your speakers

[Chorus]
