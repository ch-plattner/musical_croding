[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there, wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes it feels like I'm the only one there
I guess nobody cares, hey
But everything's good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm tired of being tired
And dealing with your BS,
All the while supplying
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty, haha
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wade it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And Imma let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow... think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page,

[Chorus 2:]
But everything's good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Outro:]
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there)
Yeah eh eaah
