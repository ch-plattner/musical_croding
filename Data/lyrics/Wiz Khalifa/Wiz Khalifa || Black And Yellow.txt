Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [4x]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [4x]

[Chorus:]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [4x]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow [4x]

[Verse 1:]
Black stripe, yellow paint, them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
I got you niggas checking game I'm balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

[Chorus:]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [4x]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [4x]

[Verse 2:]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
Bitches love me 'cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
This ain't for one night I'm shining all week hoe.
I'm sipping Cliquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up 'cause every nigga that I'm with tailored

[Chorus:]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [4x]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [4x]

[Verse 3:]
Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds, cant get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high, she wouldn't she feel that, convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back

[Chorus:]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [4x]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [4x]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [4x]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [4x]
