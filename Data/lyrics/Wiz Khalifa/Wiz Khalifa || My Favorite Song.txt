[Hook:]
When the song come on I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When the song come on I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Highly faded but I'm highly paid, I just live my life
That shit you niggas trying to do
I guarantee I did it twice
They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice
When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights
Book my flight to vegas well, 20 tho to stay the night
Another 10 on champagne, my money long I pay the price
Tired of niggas saying they in my game cause dawg we ain't alike
I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money
Money in my arms, another tables full of money
Pockets full of joints I rolled
Dropping ashes on my clothes (clothes)
Balling super hard, smoking till I over dose
Hardly ever sober bitch, we party till it's over

[Hook:]
When the song come on I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When the song come on I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

Niggas always hatin' on me, talking bout "I'm balling too"
Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do
I been going hard since I was younger
When I was in my teens I knew when I got older I'll be on some now I do my things
Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad
Going places, rolling J's, I live the life you wish you had
Throwing up dollar bills, puttin shit on my tab
Got a joint full of that OG
Got a clip full of them OG's

[Juicy J:]
Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up
Chasing after the model chicks, trying to get my fucks up
Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up
Y'all came to the club together, but that hoe gonna leave with us
Break at the blue dream, everybody rolling up
Hold the lean, hold the cups, hold it down then pour it up
Tell the owner we ain't leaving, we gonna buy the whole club

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Now my dollars to the ceiling and my card aint got no limit

[Hook:]
When the song come on I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When the song come on I'm spending money
There's something I can spend some money to... [fade to end]
