[Verse 1] 
Standin’ on the couches blowin’ on some ounces 
Shit from out the country can’t even pronounce it 
Another 100k I got that all from tourin’ 
Throw it in the air just to let em know I'm ballin’ 
Get the hotel treat it like its residential 
Classic wit no diamonds in my presidential 
Take a look at me and you can tell I'm paid 
Makin all these faces no stevie j 
Smokin weed, my hoodie and my leather on 
I got a mill just need some shit to bet it on 
I got some tree to smoke so they gone let us burn 
The waitress bringin bottles I'm just yellin church 
Standin’ on the couches blowin’ on some grass 
These niggas talkin’ shit but hate will never last 
Look at my section vip we showin class 
Kush in every joint pierre jouet in every glass 

[Hook] 
You know I'm about that shit 
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit 
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit 
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit 
You know I'm about that shit 
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit 
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit 
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit 

[Verse 2] 
You know I'm about that 
Ain’t never worried bout fallin off cuz I'ma bounce back 
Uh, where yo ounce at? 
You talkin bout yo fuckin car but where house at? 
Yea, I'm gettin cheese thoe 
Walk up in the club they treat me like I'm nino 
Uh, sippin moet 
Got a couple cars that I ain’t even drove yet 
Yea, wheres the champaign? 
Told my jeweler put some diamonds in my damn ring 
Club lookin dry make it rain for em 
Face another drink call that a brainstorm 
Tatted from my feet up, vip we meet up 
Gotta pour some liquor, gotta roll some weed up 
Then feel are face we get are plates and eat up 
Keep bringin ace this ain’t a race but if it was we’d be first place 

[Hook] 
You know I'm about that shit 
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit 
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit 
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit
