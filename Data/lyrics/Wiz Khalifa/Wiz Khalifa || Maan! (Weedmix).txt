Is it recording?
Love is life, and life is living
Fuckin' awesome, yeah!

I smoked a whole a damn pound
I'mma need another one, eyes closed I won't come down
Only papers, no we don't fuck with blunts
Nigga

I just don't be sharing weed
A nigga got pounds to burn that's apparent
Just cause you up in this bitch
Don't mean you gon' hit this shit
You better roll somethin'
Coughin' like you got a cold or something
I'm tryin to O.D. off THC
Nigga fuck around gave Young Khalifa a pound
Smoke the whole thing up in a week
Roll a joint put a worm around that motherfucker smoke it to the face
Awww shit! Nigga say he got some KK and he said he on the way
Big P told me CHURCH, get money on em every single day
So I want everything, every room, every plane, every place
We mobbin'!

Now every place that we go they say we can't smoke
But we do it anyway cuz real G's smoke when they want
When they say turn down, we turn up and turn up some more
When they say put it out, it's to loud, we burn up some more
Then we keep rollin' and rollin', and rollin'
We keep rollin', and rollin', and rollin'
We keep rollin', and rollin', and rollin'

Nigga keep going
Keep the KK blowin
Snakes in the grass keep mowin'
Ass so fat, look swollen
Another city, state gotta show in
Another airport gotta go in
Reason why you hate I'm knowin
Niggas got to much hoein'
I keep rollin' up
Drivin' a brand new car like the motherfucker stolen
They don't understand what I'm doin'
Money in my hand, nigga 28 grams when I'm rollin'
Been through NewYork, London, Paris and back
WOOOOO
SXSW only niggas smokin' on pack
Rollin' the best
Go on, get a bong, get a match
Everybody get along, get attached
Get a song, get a biatch
What they say, every dog need a cat
Pot heads need a joint to relax
G pen full of wax
10 Rolled cone joints, really fast
No sticks no seeds in the bag
Got reason to brag
In the front
Y'all b's in the back
Pair of chucks, ripped jeans is the swag
Little bitch we mobbin'!

Now every place that we go they say we can't smoke
But we do it anyway cuz real G's smoke when they want!
When they say turn down, we turn up and turn up some more
When they say put it out, it's to loud, we burn up some more
Then we keep rollin' and rollin', and rollin'
We keep rollin', and rollin', and rollin'
We keep rollin', and rollin', and rollin'
