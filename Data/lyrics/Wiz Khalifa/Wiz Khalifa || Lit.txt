We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire
[x2]

Let's get to the basics, let's get to the basics
I'm rollin' a J up, I'm lovin' the fragrance
I'm hardly on time cause my mind is where space is
But I always on grind cause that's how my fam raised me
Think I got problems, say that I'm crazy
Love marijuana, smoke on the daily
Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady
Blow the whole pound now, came up from a AV
I'm lettin' the top down, and countin' them faces
I'm blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors
I'm smokin' in public, they stare in amazement
I'm lightin' that bomb up, it's takin' me places

We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire
[x2]
