These dudes better stay in they lane
And get there brain on the right track
Now you gotta check that you can't cash
And you let ya mouth write that
We ain't playin' when the shit get real
Talk shit get your life snatched
And don't rest better guard ya grill
Thats how it is cause its like that

I move blocks to rude pops and dude drops
I'm too hot mix J, Big, and 2Pac
So move not I'm way big and dude shot
Ya crew watch I'm hot bitch and you not
I'm not a fake matter
Nigga I don't pop shit about my cake holla
Make dollars but you perp and you make nada
Not a man, not a cent ho I stay propa
Face scholar nigga let the trey 8's holla
And punk nigga play dumb get ya face swallowed
You not a hustla dog
You don't know what half a brick means
In rap, you get eight like half of sixteen
I'll bash ya team dang I'm sickening
I'm dope plus coke will smash ya trip beam man
But before all them balls come and lump ya face
With all that tuff talk and pump ya brakes
Ease back shawty

[Hook]

Ya rhyming's a waste can I mean with this basic look
The mean to face it'll eat through ya face and then
I breeze through this place
No heat on my waste, but still
Will eat through your face with knees in this place
I'm on the move now, high price big places
Leave them niggas like 100 with the big faces
Niggas try to act bad in them red cases
Till that metals in they mouth like a pair of braces
Big road talk slick up in them fake lies
Same time he just another fruit up in the grape vine
You see I laugh clock math cause I take time
And you trash plus ass at the waste line
And don't test, cause dude you'll be loosing your breathe
Got respect like I movin' the tech
And I advise you and your crew to doin' your best
Try and get your mind right or we'll be movin it left

[Hook]

You see its real when a nigga say
Ballin, really got dough, real that he say he push coke
But really got blow
Common that he claimin that he thug but he not doe
And when do a nigga say he spittin' really got flow
I ain't playin around
I'm not a gangster
But if you cross mine I'll be layin' them down
Yeah, you talk about poppin' ya heat
But when the beefs on them real OG's
Will come and rock you to sleep
Coward, In my advice you should think twice
Before you cross the path of a real nigga, live the street life
Who pull cards and reach for they heat right
'N you'll get smoked like them tree in the peace pipe
Man they put you in the dirt yeah
You steady throwin' up the set
But you ain't never put in work there
So all that talk about the game you bang
Just stay in your lane before a shot lay in your frame

[Hook]
