[Verse:]
Time keep ticking
The ash from my joint keep flicking
Ball hog, go hard for a living
Still cheese eggs in my kitchen
Still even though we gettin' stoned we still stickin' to the mission
Still take a nigga bitch
Still put a nigga on his feet and make him rich if you fuck wit em
Destiny ain't no luck just a couple niggas with felonies that I grew up wit
Aww shit's what they sayin'
The shit we smoke cut through everything that the owners spray 
The money coming like every day
But never let this shit control me, fuck what the teacher told me!
Of course that weed I keep it on me
I paint pictures, donâ€™t forget to bring a brush for all my niggas
And niggas think they ill when they rap but I'm the sickest
Cus where I'm from its about who go the hardest not the quickest
Little nigga, big engine, big units, big business
Been doin' it, been spendin', me and you a big difference, yeah 
Still ridin' in my whip with the old suspension
Grindin' hard like I ain't got the rent, I need every cent

[Hook:]
Niggas plottin', nigas climbing
Niggas puttin' overtime in
And no matter where they go
They stay the same
No matter where they go
They stay the same
