Get higher get higher... 
Get higher get higher... 
Get higher get higher... 
We can get higher when you want 
Get higher 

My jeans cost a thousand 
My whip from the old school 
Nothin’ but bosses around us 
And you ain’t got no pool 
So much champagne, I drowned in it 
OG, rolled a pound of it 
Keep it G, like the sound of it 
Came to spend money, who’s countin’ it? 
I’m the realest in the drop, just left the dealer 
In this outfit I’m a killer, tell the coppers I ain’t innocent 
If it’s poppin’, then I’m in it 
Own it all, you probably rent it 
When I talk, you niggas listen 
Thirty thousand, I’mma spend it 

Hella bottles in my section 
Throwin’ money on the floor 
No, I ain’t on the guest list 
I walk right in through the door 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 

Mixing gin up with the Tequila 
Smokin’ reefer 
Got it twisted thinkin’ I don’t get fucked up 
Make you a believer 
Camera’s outside, there go young Khalifa 
No keys, left the 69 inside 
Cuz my license just expired 
I’m in my Cadillac I don’t drive 
Hit the club and get so high 
And I don’t really know ’bout yall 
But all of my niggas got bank 
I’m payin’ for all of these bottles 
I’m a boss nigga, fuck you think? 
Good weed, good drink, better clothes 
Fast cars, club owners let us smoke 
Grind hard 
You don’t work hard, you’ll never know 
How it feel, to have a couple niggas that’s real 

Hella bottles in my section 
Throwin’ money on the floor 
No, I ain’t on the guest list 
I walk right in through the door 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 

Get Higher! [x5]
