Started out out slow,
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more,
Girl now we on the top floor,
Holding on tight, you aint letting go,
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feel it?

Oh, first class have in the game like a free throw
Fill my bank up with cash my glass were clicquot
You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about
Or the places we go, we go
You're mine for the night, your man trying to repo,
Work nights, never sleep so you think she got no job
Go to school during the week, on the weekend we go hard,
Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it's yo card
It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is yo song

Started out out slow,
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more,
Girl now we on the top floor,
Holding on tight, you aint letting go,
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feel it?

Oh nothing you could tell us, they get jealous when we show up, show up
Make you feel like a little girl again, but fuck you like a grown up
High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from
My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up
Pour a bottle and toast up, your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is, so what
You still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
Know what the saying is, money talks and you aint saying shit
I'm a call you soon as I land
Probably roll some weed right up on the beach while you tan
Party every week and you hardly would speak
But now you got my phone taking pictures laughing smoking chilling yeah

Started out out slow, slow,
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more
Girl now we on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and letting go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it?

We don't hear nobody talk about it probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off and I tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high
We don't hear nobody talk about it probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off and I tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high.
