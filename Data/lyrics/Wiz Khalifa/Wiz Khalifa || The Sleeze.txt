This here I'm going insane, mental disease
Puttin' a bar up to a place, niggas can't reach
Bout to cop so many chains, lil Mr.t
Doe boy she give me brain, she needed degree
She dropped it to the floor, she did it for the cheese
Told her that I need some more, she did it with sleaze
Clique full of G's
And they go ape, don't swing through the trees
Tried, them triggers will squeeze
Did it with sleaze
And your wifey love a nigga with sleeves
Hit it and leave
I ain't stressing, when will you niggas believe
Shit is a breeze
Give me the keys

[Hook:]
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze
They say I run the game, literally
I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze
My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy
My job is sleazy, its way too easy
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze

Ain't too much hustling
Get it go straight to the bank, my nigga I can't get enough of it
Ashes all over my jeans, if this shit stank I'm puffing it
Trying to do shit just like Puff did it
Dirty ass game, ain't no loving it
That nigga hates, bitches lovin' it
They say I run the game
Got fortune, fuck the fame
My garage is like a showroom, couple ounces in my brain
Damn she fine, niggas can be
Buy me all the newest things, my dick is for free
Everywhere I go, my weeds in it
My crew-necks reps jeans with it
Take no swag, mix sleaze with it
Take your ho, spend cheese with us
Everywhere I go, my weeds in it
My crew-necks reps jeans with it
Take no swag, mix sleaze with it
Taylor Gang, we beast with it

[Hook]

Taylor Gang
If you real badass, you know what I'm talking bout
Fuck the rules, we make our own
I'm my own bars
I count my own money
I fire the fuck out of you niggas If I feel like it
And I'm sleazy as hell
Feel me?

[Hook]
