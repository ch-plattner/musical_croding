[Intro:]
Yeah...
Whaddup Taylor Gang,
Starpower...
It's star year.
You know what it is!

[Chorus:]
Ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body...

[Verse 1:]
Got so many tats. you can't even count 'em up
In the shop ery'week, I can't seem to get enough
My aunt said my skin too clean to mark it up
But I'm a' "ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck"
I'm blowin' purp., no shirt
Windows down, screamin' "cash rules", showin' off my tattoos
Hoes spazzin' when they see me
Run up on me starstruck, askin' can they read me
See Matt and told 'em "Sleeve me"
Heard your man gotta' star tat. and tryin' to be me
I make it look easy, people say I'm crazy
Body marked up like a wall in the 80's
Speakers scream loud like a car full of babies
Chain's so sick, think my charm came with rabies
All I heard these days is (I think you're goin' overboad with it)
I ain't addicted, I'm committed,
It's Wizzle man...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Got stars over here, little star over there
Stars everywhere, 'cause nigga' it's star year
The name star power, my jewelry star bright
The tat. on my face say I'm livin' the star life
And by the way, you know it's Taylor Gang
So as you see us, I'm inked up, from my feet up
I keep blunts flickin', new tats. ichin'
Black chucks coppin', new shit droppin'
I'm the one they call young,
Body marked up like the subway in harlem.
Niggas say it's "hard", white people think it's awesome
Chest, neck tatted, whole sleeve on my arm done
They say I look like Tyga man
I put some lime in the swisher sweet & twist it all up
Can't wear a shirt, the bitches lift it all up
I'm tattin' my body, 'til I filled it all up

[Chorus x2]
