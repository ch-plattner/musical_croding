[Verse 1]
And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne,
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all,
when you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke their bank is injured
Then bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner
And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred
on a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business don't play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V,
Plus the most exclusive treat in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
and that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk and taking it off
Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller
you know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I'm a baller
Live for today, it's not like my father

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
