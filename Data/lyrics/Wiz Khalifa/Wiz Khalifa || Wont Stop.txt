[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
In the trap with some killers on the real
Real man, I am man
On the real, I'm in the trap with some killers
On the real, I'mma stack me a million
On the real, I'mma fuck this nigga broad
On the real, I just won't stop going hard
On the real, on it, on it
On the real, on it, on it

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Kush in my hands, wake up smoking them grams
She say I'm the man, can't keep her face out my pants
Hand full of rings, gold on my saint
Don't even fuck with you, fuck what you think
Covered in ink
Bitches are loving me because of my money
I know there'd be days like this
But, never knew I would wake up, roll a joint, do my thing, and get paid like this
I walk in the bank, the shark out the tank
I give 'em that thing, he gone aim and don't blink
He aimin', don't blink
I'm doing everything that you can't

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Talkin' G's but you ain't 'round none
Get a pound in your city man, it ain't 'bout nothin'
If I gotta send it on a plane, I'mma get it
Give a fuck what a nigga think, boy I'm with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuki Carter]
You niggas some haters
You niggas not playas, you niggas is fakers
You niggas is faker than [?]
You niggas did salty, high sodium
The fuck is you sayin'?
I'm focused on camera, the fuck is you sayin'?
You suckers is pussy
You focused on fuckin' the plans
Rollin' through [?] I'm rollin' with your ho
My nigga have no hope
I'm fuckin' your bitch in the pussy and [?] be rolling up your dough
Your niggas ain't loyal, your whole crew was [?] but one of them rich
The rest of them [?] but most of you flex
A nigga that don't know, you don't know
My niggas got six cals more than your four-four
Pop up your top, one more shot to the top of your block
With that chop, you drop
You be talkin' no mo'
My bitches get bitches that come with more bitches, ya'll niggas ain't got no hoes
We come to your city, we takin' your [?] and leavin' out with bolos
Your niggas is smokin' that 50, ya'll ain't even keepin' that shit hunna

[Hook]
