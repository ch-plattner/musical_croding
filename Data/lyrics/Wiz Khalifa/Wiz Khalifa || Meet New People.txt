Yeeahh
Hahahah It's Young Khalifa man
Taylor Gang
Yehh... Proud to say every body smokin joints right now
It's a Blunt free environment
Yeah, I'm in Canada too, fuckin great everything's great

Uhh, Wiz ell man the fans, the critics know me
Feet sunk in the sand blowing an O Z
Yeaahh leave your bitch with a real nigga
Round her, I met her it's going down like a slow leak
The more cake the more hate's that's on me
I just fuck more bitches and roll more weed
And umm I'm the man to these hoe's,
Promoters paying me grands for my shows Mosley Rose
Fast cars and buying out the bars
Champaign, planes and rock stars
Shawty says she's' half-baked n ready to skate to outer space so I take her to Mars.
We can party I'm a put some Jordan shorts on
Roll joints and play some old school songs.
Amazed on how it's so easily roll hate niggas wanna police their hoes.

We came to party, We grown
Smoke all this weed and get blown
And meet new people she wanna be free so leave those hand cuff's at home.
And if she's decide if she's leaving with me
Then let your bitch choose
No need to hate the player just hate the game
You know the rules fool.
