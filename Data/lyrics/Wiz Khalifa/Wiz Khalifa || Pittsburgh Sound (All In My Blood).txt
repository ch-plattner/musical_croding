[Intro:]
Yea

Its That 412
I Got That Pittsburgh Sound

[Verse 1:]
Around These Parts
Im Known As The Youngest In Charge
My Shit Bang Out The Trunk Of Your Car
Its The Cities Known Rap Spitta
Semi Blown Clack Niggas
Skin And Bones But Really Known As That Nigga
Im Known To Chase The Bucks
Grind To Get My Paper Up
In The Studio Writin Rhymes Til The Paper Crunch
Im Not The Type That U Would Call Em A Thug
But Im A Huster Its All In My Blood
So If Its All For The Cheese Then Im In It
My Screws Kinda Loose So I Ease To The Finish
I Hop Up In The Coupe Feel The Breeze While Im In It
Blowin Smoke Up Out The Roof From The Trees That Im Spliffin
Youngin Got The Game On Lock
Im On Top Its A Shame Yall Not
You A Lame Put Ur Brain On Pot
Leave U Wet Like The Rain Yall Drop
Im Gon Rock And I Aint Gon Stop... Nigga

[Hook:]
Whos The Kid Spittin Flames

I Got That Pittsburgh Sound
And Imma Always Hold Pittsburgh Down
Its Wiz Khalifa Man
U Cant Tell By Now
Pittsburgh Imma Swell My Town
That Steel City Damn

[Verse 2:]
Roll Rubber U Dont Know Who U Dealin With
O So Inocent But Flows So Billigant
My Spit Games Like A 44 Killin Shit
Know Your Man Warm But The Young Ball Killin Shit
Realist Shit And Your Main Wife Dig Me
Game Try And Hit Me
Kick Game Like 50 Cent
Niggas Wanna Play Games I Quickly
Mob With A Squad That Will Bang Yall Wit Me
And They Want The Kid Still Hurtin
Hundred Niggas Wit Hammers
Yea Thats Wat I Call A Steal Curtain
I Handle My Time And Still Work It
Put In Work Couple Mil. Worth In
And Im From Pittsburgh Where The Green
And The Eatin Is Good
Where The Fiends Do Everything In The Hood
Everyday Is Like A War So My Soldiers Ride Fatiguesin The Hood
And We Gettin All The Green Like We Should... You Know Yea

[Hook]
