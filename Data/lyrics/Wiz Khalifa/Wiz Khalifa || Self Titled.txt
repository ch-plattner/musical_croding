
You know how we do! Yeah This is what I do young. From my side of the city the dip side
Let's Ride. Yes Sir All my gangsters grab your weapons, punks hit the door. Let's get it
Let's get it yeah uhh.
I ain't nothin nice
Line em up buckem twice
Lay em' down middle fingers up screamin fuck your life
I roll them 7â€²s out go head and tuck your dice
Crack your skull never seemed sicker in your fuckin life
See I don't hustle white
Scrawny but my knuckles right
Left hand will leave them shook hooks not to stuff you right
And when your hands ashy only time you've touched the white
Snatch your grind now it my grind you could'nthustle right
See I'm a hungry dude feelin the pain
Ribs touchin got the thrill in my vains
And you niggas is all in the sunshinen but we still in the rain
And for the team leave you spillin your brains
Cause I ain't feelin you lames
Now clowns should be feelin ashamed
So put the heat to your temple and bang
Me and my soldiers in that that black on black we killin again
You dudes pumped put a chill in your frame

[Chorus:]
Let's go man!
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo brotha respect mine
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop
You know who rule this shit
The city is mine
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo brotha respect mine
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop
Yeah The city is mine.

Ready willing and able, hand I've been keeping it stable
Have a leg on the table, since the killing of abel
Bullets ripe through your facial, yeah will give you a face full
I'm into making it painful on the man like you on cable
See you dudes is some divas, leave us we move with the heaters
Beef and we shoot to get beat as we turn you dudes to believers
Yeah I'm rocking and ready blowin um cockin um steady popping um
Potsing um I'm heavy droping the top on the chevy
Let em bang through the smith and your brain will be missing
Change the game it was written changing the lane when I'm whipping
It's only natural you hate me cause I'm hot, cause I get love
In the streets and I ain't never played the block. You see
I do me and you can't never play me cause you not.
The flow is ludacris, coming for that number one spot
So get outta line and get smacked in. I move with the movers
You lose with the losers they smooth when executing manuevers

[Chorus:]
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo brotha respect mine
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop
You know who rule this shit
The city is mine
You should rip my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo brotha respect mine
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop
The city is mine.
