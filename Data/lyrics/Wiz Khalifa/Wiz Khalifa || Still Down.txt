[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All my niggas is day ones
I only fuck with A1's
You niggas know what the gang is
We young black and dangerous
Still down with my day one niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down with the shit
Still down with my A1 niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down, still down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, they can't believe I'm still here
Made a million dollars but I wouldn't replace it for nothin'
A lotta niggas been killed here
I done seen niggas get they whole shit blown off in public
A lotta blood, sweat, and hope came from this block
When floodin', a lotta dope came from this block
But fuck it, I'm in my whip pushing buttons
I think about the ones that dead and gone and ones that still thuggin'
Uh, and they still down
Got no love for them pussy ass motherfuckers, cause they still clowns
Smokin real pounds, just bought a real home
Me and my watch, both real stoned
Pour some G in, man it's all about the [?]
New Ferrari or a Benz
Get a joint and hold it in
And I been with the same niggas since they was hitting licks and yeah they still with the shits

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, Taylor Gang, chevy
Yo, tell them niggas we nothin' alike
They see us and imitate what they want to be like
What's hand and hand to them J's next day on the flight
Shit, where I'm fun if you're out too late then you're playing with your life
Bet they feel how I feel, dinner out in Brazil
My day ones'll see about you for me for real
And the finest of fashion, makin' a statement
Who thought it used to take me to get it now anything we can afford it
Hate us so much that I'm cakin', I ain't mad at them at all
Just know about this dough, don't make or make you a John
Huh, the same ones that been A1's
A few niggas gone act different when that change come
Yeah, horsepower from that [?] vision
It's taylor gang, when you they ask you tell them we the business
Them niggas tryna copy us, they lookin' stupid
Swear, dressing all crazy, boy you look like a build-a-bear

[Hook]

Still down, down, down, down, down
All day errday I come around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
We stay down, down, down, down, down
All day errday they say we wouldn't make it
It's just me and my niggas
Just me and my niggas

[Hook]
