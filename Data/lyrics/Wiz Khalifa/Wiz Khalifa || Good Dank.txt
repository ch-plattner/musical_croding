Yea........ten steps ahead of these niggas, thats y they fuck wit me instead of these niggas..fool,
Kush and orange juice nigga, I'm tryna use betta words...BEATCHH...germ on the boards,
This time around we want all the money, you niggas short changin, shit, show sumthin...
Champagne and e-z widers....presidential view

[Verse 1]
I keeps it real nothin like you actors do joints I flick,
Bong raps I kicks all cant rips this off tag on your matress fool,
You rather b hi this that shit bitch now u in the presence of the fly
Luis cover my eyes
Not them 100 dollar ray bands fam these 675
Rap ass niggas tellin u lies runnin game sumthins money jus cant distguise
So y keepin it g is where I keep my pride
You a lame smoke some good wit a a cuple of niggas who ride
Look fella
Trees yella and jus by the smell you can tell us cronic I smoke my pockets on mozzerella
Your bitch here twistin up like propellas
Got my paper rite now we like white boy here they way they jelous, 

[Chorus]
When we come we came to spend money we think it aint nothin thats why we get to cuffin
They hoes she comin to drank and smoke some of this good dank then go back to my place dont ask you already know,
Aint worried bout another nigga while I'm gettin mine homie I aint got the time,
Face in the clouds I'm feelin like the time is on my side,
But they dont wanna see me flyyyyyyyyy..they dont wanna see meee fllyyyyyyyyy....life is all I know,
Flick this weed and dro, grindin paid its toll, (oh, oh) now everywhere I go I flyyyy, 

[Verse 2]
Most of my bitches use and abuse these niggas callin em makin em pay they dues
Spendin all your hard earned money on bags and shoes when all they need is kush and orange juice
Shit thats what I feed em, they download my songs watch my interviews and read em,
Treat her like u love her I fuck her once then I dont need her,
I'm playin I keep a couple of those skinnies that I hit up anytime I'm in they city shorty,
I aint on a sports team but ya nigga ballin, dont pick up my line less I see its money callin,
Jordan shorts by the pair and my sox is ralph lauren, and I got that dank from my nigga down new orleans,
Real as they come everyone of my niggas all in,
Niggas'll talk slick but me I'm gettin to the paper cuz they see us and act like they never hated 

[Chorus]
Where we come we came to spend money we think it aint nothin thats y we get to cuffin
They hoes she comin to drank and smoke some of this good dank then go back to my place dont ask you already know,
Aint worried bout another nigga while I'm gettin mine homie I aint got the time,
Face in the clouds I'm feelin like the time is on my side,
But they dont wanna see me flyyyyyyyyy..they dont wanna see meee fllyyyyyyyyy....life is all I know,
Flips this weed and dro, grindin paid its toll, now everywhere I go I flyyyy,
... taylor gang in this bitch....e you a fool, big bags of kush, put a x in the middle, add the orange juice nigga...
