
They say the boy sick and they can't diagnose my symptoms
Went and seen the doctor trynna find me a prescription
Told him since the early teen all I see the color green
He say it ain't nothing wrong probably wasn't listening
Listening, Out of town where any of the paper be
Grandma tell me go to church somebody need to pray for me
So I leave and go and see the preacher he said holy smoke
See I'm nothing like you my pockets got the holy ghost
From that side of town where you can get for the shorty loow
Fuck about a price tag everythings affordable
And my homie told me if you a nigga be a rich one
Why you on ya ass if you ain't got no money get sum

Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Different city everynight I'm a star
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all

If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Every night a different chick in my car
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all

Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

I wake up and think of bout how to get my paper
Then roll some and stink up say hi to all you haters
No teacher can school me I'm smart but not a scholar
Shit if I was a book Id be all about a dollar
I never had a job or something that I majored
I've been hustling since a cub had a buzz like a pager
You straight from the path and I'm on one that's narrow
Dacasein muchavo that mucho deniro
Fresh like a Pharaoh My clothes come from Caro
The beat kick like Bruce lee my flow some like Paro
(Like PARO?) Like Paro and ain't afraid to spend it
That mean I'm getting money if you ain't got yours get it

Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some Get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
