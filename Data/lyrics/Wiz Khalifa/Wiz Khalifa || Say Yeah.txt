Throwin' money, them bitches hit the ground
Then bring it back up, she bring him back up
Put 'em in that black truck, so many hoes they lapped up

She need her own show, slide on down that pole and grind slow

Hell no, I ain't countin' my dough, I came to blow it all
And get some brains trynna find miss know it all
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up a chick and just chill

In the back of the club with a stack full a dubs
Drop it low like a pro, bring it back, that's what's up
