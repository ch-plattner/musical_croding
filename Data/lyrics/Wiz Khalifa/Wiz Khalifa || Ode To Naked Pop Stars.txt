Always had a crush on you, that you didn't even know was there.
Let me introduce myself, they call me Young Khalifa man. (okaayyy)
Young Khalifa man, call me Young Khalifa man
Next time you're home takin' pictures, call me if you need a hand.
I'll be everything you want, spend time alone and be you're friend.
Pick you up from lunch and shit, I'll probably beat you to the crib.
You gon' have me doin' shit, just solely off them snapshots.
I'll lick you from head to toe, look down and eat the snack box.
Came home from the studio, seen you with no t-shirt on.
And couldn't help but feel like this, I hope that you don't take it wrong.
Ain't seen you in person, so I figured I'd just make a song.
And anyone that feel the way I feel, will probably sing along.
You look good with them jeans on.
Wasn't for this night I'da never knew you had them rings on.
I don't know him, but whoever stole your mack.
When I see him, I'm a pat him on the back.

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up.
And I say the same thing every single time.

I think of you undressed, think of you undressed
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed.

Future sex love I be on that Timberlake shit.
I be there to download em, everytime you take pics.
Everything tatted, so they call me Young Travis.
We ain't gotta go to the shop, we already matchin'
Paper through the roof, but baby money ain't the topic.
I can put it on you til you pray I never stop it.
Go through everyday just to get some shit accomplished.
But I can't help but think bout them pictures of you topless.
Like a nerd with no macbook, look how purty that lil' cat look.
I see them nine lives pokin' from the back.
And I'm tryin' to kick the habit, but you gotta nigga crack hooked.
Yeah just know my album is a classic,
And out of all the flicks, my favorite pictures when you grabbed it.
Standin' with no towel on, wish I was where your hand is.
That ring up in your nipple make a nigga think of marriage.

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
(Well ya'll probably done it pretty big, but I got more than money girl)
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up.
And I say the same thing every single time.

I think of you undressed, think of you undressed
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed.
(Okaay!, I hope you don't take this in a disrespectful way, this how I do, young taylor gang)
