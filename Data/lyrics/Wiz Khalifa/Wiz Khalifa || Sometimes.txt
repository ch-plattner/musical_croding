Sometimes I don't know if you're tellin the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do
Seems that you're runnin around
Every night late comin home when I call
And I don't know what to do
Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you
Sometimes...

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I hear you talkin to me
You sick and tired of the kid man
Sometime you feel like you talkin through me
That's when you walk up to me
Trying for attention
Ma listen
You wild'n Stop trippin
Cus a nigga work too hard too long
Always got a show or in the studio doin a new song
Them other dudes could'ntwalk with my shoes on
Still I come home hearin bout what I do wrong
Pullin stunts and
Rollin blunts
With my dudes from the hood
But to you they no good
I'm just doin what I could
And that's givin the circumstances
You only get one shot at these certain chances
Instead of trying to find dirt
And where your manners
Try and understand when that work demanded
And no mama that's not a punch line
I'm always there when it's crunch time
But still you say

Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you
Sometimes...

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Now I know you hear the he say she say
Your home girls got my every move on replay
Scream'n how you know niggas
And the games that we play
But all the while I've been grindin for this weeks pay
Hustlin each day in order to eat right
Call me sayin she need me in order to sleep right
Not really knowin what these streets like
So you stay up until I come back
A nigga love that
Help me relax
Warm plate an the dub sack
And after that proceed the bend the back
Then I'm back to politics the usual
And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you
But... Damn...
