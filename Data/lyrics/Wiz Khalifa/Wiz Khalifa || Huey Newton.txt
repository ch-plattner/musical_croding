[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Fast livin', good weed, bad women
Rollin' up joints with hash in 'em
True pot head do everything last minute
Not concerned with the cash I'm spendin' because the cash i get it
Groupies fall through and crash with us
Watch movies, laugh, go in they bag and smoke they last with us
Bongs, bowls, vapors, gas masks and stuff
Niggas know we the shit, cameras flash on us
Roll the grass up, bottles on chill
Fill your glass up
Niggas losin' they business soon as they glance
Because they know the difference between the small time business
And the enterprise, my nigga
Ain't been gone, it's just been a while, my nigga
Battery strong, I'm energized, my nigga
I'm tryna ball, you playin' the game
Haters sayin' I changed
I say look at my chain, mane

[Chorus]
Why they hate me boy
I'm just goin hard cuz it's out there for us
Now I'm all in they faces, cuz I'm on the road
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone

[Curren$y - Verse 2]
The life I'm proud of the triple OG advice
Listen and apply
You niggas just sittin' round us tryna shake ya hide
Talkin' too much round the bitches
Lookin' tight, bowzo and everybody in the room know
Rabbies flow dog trill kujo
Michael Knight gotcha bitches on the bus playin' excite bike
Roll somethin' you ain't here just to be a bad bitch
Spitta the originator, high rappin' aircraft shit
Goons died tryna fly a jet, word to maverick
Doobie passes, like magic
Lit the forum up 80s status
Lace my forums up high top adidas strap classic
Can't tell me nathin' bout my 79 lando
Chroma door dayton, vacation
Carry on do it while you carry on hatin'

[Chorus]
Why they hate me boy
I'm just goin hard cuz it's out there for us
Now I'm all in they faces, cuz I'm on the road
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
