
It's a new year, new day, the hardest regardless of what you dudes say truthfully
Who we glue to me, money talks was taught to speak fluently
Its nothin new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me
It only took me months to get through the streets,
but when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard,
nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard
Yeah but niggas are gon hate though, no matter who you are there's another wantin your place bro
Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow, learn fast to mow the grass, the snakes low
A look past the love some niggas ain't sure, made me my own man now I do my grown man
More advanced a young'n nearly in the game, shit lookin better now but I remember the rain

Rain,
I still remember the rain
I still remember the rain
I still remember the rain 
I still remember..

Feelin slept on knowin I'm the best songwriter or freestyle ill bite a niggas head off
The flow was ill before I inked the deal I signed cuz a flow like mine needs a mill
I grind for real and that's no days off you work hard for it and its gon pay off
You can rap you can work a j-o-b or duckin the policeman cars tryna pump weight off
See I was taught to get it how you live, niggas know wiz has been about his bread
In the stu(dio) I'm a beast I can speak to em all day in high school have what u need in the hallways
Stuff long benches with raw haze attention is nothing new its true I've been that nigga always
So what u sayin
Remain the same with fame I gained its good now but I remember the rain
Ya I remember the rain

Rain, 
I still remember the rain 
I still remember the rain
I still remember the rain
I still remember..
Rain..
