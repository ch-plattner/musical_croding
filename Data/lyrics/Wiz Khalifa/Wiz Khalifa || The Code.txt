[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cash in the bag twirlin up hash
Blue in the count and I pour it out the mask
Weed on repeat up all night
Cash always leak got hoes all tight
Live and you burn, grind and you earn
Bitch I'm on fire, I sit and I burn
Stackin' up money flippin' it too
Y'all ain't heard me but theï»¿ benjamin's do
I'm bouncin' through the club like tigger
I'm a hit the dope, I'm a hit the liquor
Nigga get wrong I'm a hit a nigga
Take a nigga bitch home and I'm a hit her

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Reppin' Tgod
All these diamonds on me
Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Reppin' Tgod
All these diamonds on me
Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, Taylor Taylor

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Bitch I'm taylored ain't na ho cut from the same cloth
Realest, this money only thing fame brought
The crown ain't safe and I'm comin' for the spot
Snatchin' all wigs bitch I'm coming for the top
Put a run up on trip how I run up in the shots
Queen Roe, I don't see nothin' but the gwap

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
All my money I'm a get it soon as I get it I'm a spend it
Bought a new car soon as I whip this
Smokin' that marijuana in it
Takin' the value down but also taking a pound
And breakin' it smokin' it all to me ain't no savin' it
Fuck with them pods plus seeds so no shakin' it

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Uh, fuck these niggas they ain't really bout that
Look I know what these niggas these niggas all rap
What they know about nights that they never come back
But he two shot now shells all in the mac
On the top will never see none of that fall back

And we gettin' bake on anywhere the bread at

[Hook 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor

Lil' Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
