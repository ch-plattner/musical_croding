Come and walk with me I've seen a lot in my life so come and talk with me through the streets of the city back and forth with me to the slums of my home this that shit that only come from my home
Pittsburgh

Welcome to pistolvania an hour ride from {Pittsburgh} where kids earn stripes get rip and flip birds
A loss on da strip neva
Hussle dope crack coke to dat fifth letta all ova that big chedda
And you can front here fuck around and get slumped here big enough a body in a trunk here
Where white tees and fitted caps match the night game we drop bets on fast cars and dice games
Shorty smile pretty face and a nice frame
I'm a mac got her in da back gettin pipe game
But that's a day in da life some may say that we trif but keep gettin money cakin up nice
This were da crime rate is sky high what can I say man crime pays and some body gotta die
Only one good thing could make a man put da pump to you and that's to see his fam live comfortable
Walk with me

Come and walk with me I've seen a lot in my life so come and talk with me through the streets of the city back and forth with me to the slums of my home this that shit that only come from my home
Pittsburgh

This were da girls pop shit like niggas, get chips like niggas, lock strips and cop wips like niggas
And da dudes tend to act like bitches, don't want to strap like bitches, put run they got dam trap like bitches
You see my team get cake like ya'll
Flip weight like ya'll
A little similar but ain't like ya'll
A lot of haters where I rest at
You should except that
It's not that they have the choice to cake like ya'll
Hop in da coupe and I'm switchin lanes when I drive
Stayin focus hit this roach again and I'm high
On my way to the jungle put this smoke in da breeze where da weed is not a want it's a need
And I'm from 412 got a problem with any bitch nigga that be runnin round talk about me this and that
Where I'm from real niggas don't talk we listen back

Come and walk with me I've seen a lot in my life so come and talk with me through the streets of the city back and forth with me to the slums of my home this that shit that only come from my home
Pittsburgh

Now there's a couple things to get cleared
Bitch I'm da prince here
Slip get yo shit smeared and fished out in six years
Yea you can scuba dive with no swim gear in {Pittsburgh} niggas make sure that them trenchs clear
Da block hot for realla make a lot of ckrilla a hustlers dream get the cream and go pop da villa
I make cash freaks better shake ass I skeet and make da game dash like rock-a-fella
