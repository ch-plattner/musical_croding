I be over seas, I be in LA
I be in the South, trappin hard all day
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be MIA
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid
I be overseas, I be in LA
I be in New York, I be MIA

If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread
I count a hundred million dollars fore I go to bed
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne
I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn game
I'm out in A town, bout to go to mansion
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryina do
I brought the whole thing so that's what I'm a smoke
I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak
Smokin til I choke, my watch need a vault

I be over seas, I be in LA
I be in the South, trappin hard all day
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be MIA
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid
I be overseas, I be in LA
I be in New York, I be MIA

On vacation we the rotation
Doing relaxation, tripy nation
Chasing bands
All our chicks look like Sports Illustrated
I get high as a plane with no final destination
On that gin, on that Hen and that lean intoxication
Rocking dollars, rocking gold
Money tall like my Nuvo
In a presidential suite, with some playmates centrefold
Niggas out here chasing ass when they should be chasing cash
I be smoking til it's gone, Juicy J don't waste no gas
With her legs lift up, I thought it was a stick up
Should've seen them hoes that pick up and start to lift up
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee
They call me the money tree
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree

I be over seas, I be in LA
I be in the South, trappin hard all day
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be MIA
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid
I be overseas, I be in LA
I be in New York, I be MIA

You already know what it is Nigga
It's that Cabin Fever 2
Shout out to everybody who got the first Cabin Fever
If you're listening to this right now
You're probably on the 2050 tour with us
So welcome to that
It's TGOD man, where we smoke footlong joints
Number KK and cookies all day
Pittsburg in this bitch
Every time that we hit man, I know y'all in this bitch
So what we goin do is roll another joint, keep this thing going
It's Cabin Fever, 2050
ONIFC is in stores December 4th
ONIFC December 4th
Make sure y'all go and get that shit man
Taylor Gang album
Let's get it
