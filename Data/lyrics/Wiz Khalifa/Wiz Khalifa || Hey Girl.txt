I'm very very glad you came
Your such a beautiful thing
Hey girl what you say
I'm very very glad you took the time
Your such a beautiful thing

Hey girl wanna let you know
What's going through my head while I'm staring out this window
But everytime I try to find the words to explain, I fail
Hey girl heard your story before
Your parents don't get it and your boyfriend is an A-Hole
And going to work in the morning drives you insane, I know
So you like to kick it with the bad boys
Pose like you flickin for the tabliods
Fros out making niggas fast foward
I'll just be an other cool kid that past on

And no matter how hard I felt
Played the best way I can with the cards I've delt
For the day I can say it's nice to meet you
Wait till next time I see you, I'm a say
Hey girl what's your name
I'm very very glad you came
Your such a beautifull thing
Hey girl what you say
I'm very very glad you took the time
Your such a beautiful thing

Hey girl are we compatible
I like tarantino flakes and a long talks and I'm a vergo
It's so much that I thinkin nothing to say
Hey girl it's been a month or so
And I've been on the road singing songs flyin solo
When I go to sleep
Your the girl in my dreams
So I got your picture on my mac book screen
Save her somethin about this age it's just like me
Shorty got flavor like my favorite ice cream
And I'm a scoop her one day and make her life change
To then I'm like dang

And no matter how hard I felt
Played the best way I can with the cards I've delt
For the day I can say it's nice to meet you
Wait till next time I see you, I'm a say

Hey girl what's your name
I'm very very glad you came
Your such a beautifull thing
Hey girl what you say
I'm very very glad you took the time
Your such a beautiful thing
