
Say baby, Imma wake up for you
Imma have my way with your body
And when I'm done touching you
I bet you won't wanna
Give yourself to nobody
Baby when the lights go out
It's like we're the only ones
And I already feel it now
It's like you're the only one
Only one who knows just how
How to make the time stand still
We're caught in the moment

[Hook:]
So don't let me down
You made those promises
Don't take em back now
Don't let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let's get caught in the moment
Let's get caught in the moment

Smoking one and rolling one
I come and break you down for fun
You love it when I get up in it
Kiss your body when I'm finished
My drop crotch is by Knomadik
My drop top is automatic
Put you in it, now you tweaking
I kidnap you for the weekend
Rolling up and going up
I'm smoking weed and pouring up
I take that money, hold it up
I take your legs and fold em up
I take my time, I break it down
I tell you not to make a sound
I take that KK and pass it round
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground

[Hook]
