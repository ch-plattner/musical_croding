so high i can touch the sky [x10]

[Verse 1]
Im livin this movie, movie, you niggas like tivo,
see the same things twice, nothing like me though,
man they can dream, flow like a whole key low. 
now i got your bitch, try and find me like nino,
spend a lot of cash , can't front or i might leave broke
one live to live, 800 on the weed smoke,
stacks for them guccis like, fuck it im'a need those
young superstar, well were feelin like heroes 
top down, and im flying like an eagle, 
tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo
all about my green, bout my green like cheelo
stars in my face, no stars not cheenos 
smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though 
hate enough for, show my ass with my jeans low
started from the bottom, now made it like zero
got it on lockdown, feeling like nino!

[Chorus]

Yeah they talk, but i cant hear what they say, cause im flyin sware they see me but im too many miles away, cause im flying, in the air your all the way down, and im flyin, to the sky, i don't touch the ground! Im flyin

so high i can touch the sky [x8]

Now im in florida, yeah they know me there too,
walkin with jewels out, showin all my tattoos, 
can't say my name right, but they know im that dude
Walk 54 place, niggas eatin fast food
brother out in Lauderdale, cousin down in Van U
Me i got a plug, good drugs when i land too
know im underage, not much that i can't do
you don't talk money, thats why i cant understand you 
see im hot now, going for a grammy though 
think this bitch bad, you should see my Miami ho
Down in south beach, met her at the Cameo 
Told her what my life like, took her to the Sagamo
100 grand on my neck, just cause i gotta glow 
Never buyin dough, whole zips when i gotta blow 
always dressed to impress you can tell, 
she love my cologne, thats money that you smell, yeah!

[Chorus]

Yeah they talk, but i cant hear what they say, cause im flyin sware they see me but im too many miles away, cause im flying, in the air your all the way down, and im flyin, to the sky, i don't touch the ground! Im flyin so high i can touch the sky [x8]
