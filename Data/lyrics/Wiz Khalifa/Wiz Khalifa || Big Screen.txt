this the top, oh yeah the tippy
its young khalifa mannn
i see it clearly the money that is
oh yall niggas aint in the way keep doing what you doing
see right thru you

Got me drinking out the bottle,
living for today aint thinking about tomorrow,
niggas fake i can see it with my eyes closed,
in desperate need of a leader so they follow,
and me i only see chavo,
i roll up blizzy and hit it like a high note,
my skin tough as a rhinos,
so keep hating i keep dating these dime hoes,
diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my chain,
city or your state catch me mobbin with my gang,
nigga violate they wont hestiate to aim,
man i got enough change to afford the price of fame,
im like poison to yall lames, or drugs or prescriptions,
turn my music on get a buzz when you listening,
you want them then pay for em,
and niggas talk fly but im space gone up out of here,

[chorus:]
i never sleep but i got big dreams,
lil nigga i do big things,
you know its everything that it seems,
they say my life is like the big screen (big screen),
i fill my bank with every 16,
my money straight and my bitch mean,
you should wait and get a ticket please,
they say my lifes like the big screen (big screen),

i feel like a desperado, on the track i just kick it like rihlo
see me on the tv ya i be in grind mode,
but please believe im in the streets like pot holes,
Antonio no guitar tho, only instrumental is that pistol,
need a right hand so i fucks with chevy,
and underneath the wing so i hustle heavy,
tatted on my face, chest, neck, hand, stomach,
been on that paper chase since that cake start runnin,
never touched the brick, i aint never slung no drugs,
i still get a feeling when i see that gold car coming,
got my pops old soul, im a 80s baby,
moms smoke hella weed im a wavy baby,
you mr me 2, and you need fuel man,
you niggas see through air,

[chorus]
