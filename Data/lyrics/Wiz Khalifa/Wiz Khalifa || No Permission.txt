When I ride by
I want you to see what I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit's very clear, ugh

Pass me a joint, guarantee I'mma hit it
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it
I got a old school ass car you can sit in
I got a crib that you probably can't get in
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it
I been at work on the grind for a minute
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Countin' my benjis
Puttin' it all in the bank but don't really mind if I spend it
Can't take it? don't cross the line when you finish
When you stay all on your grind you can get it
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen
Duckin' them shots, that's divine intervention
I be so high, try me, come visit
You make a choice, hope you like the decision
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted
Go off the smoke just like I'm a magician
Ain't fuck with me? Then she prolly was trippin'
Lightin' 'em up just like the electricians
Get to this money, get high my intentions
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together we stick to the mission
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together we stick to the mission
Rollin' that weed up without no permission

Oh, oh, money come and money go
And stay the same no
Oh, oh, money come and money go
And stay the same no
