[Hook: x4]
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that

[Wiz talking: during hook]
Yeah! It's Young
Wiz Khalifa man
4-1-2 Pittsburgh, Pistolvania and all that
Uh-huh. but right now we gon' talk money
So talk to me
Ya kno? Yeahhh!

[Verse 1:]
If she wanna talk to me, I'm a talk back
Said she love my music and she think I'm all that
Told me I be on her mind like a fitted ball cap
Love the way I blow money, and get it all back
Cup full of that Patron, swish it like a ball bat
Skinny lil nigga but my pockets all fat
And I'm lookin for a dime, or better yet a dove
So if that pussy good go and show a nigga love
Yeah, I'm posted in the club and there's freaks errwhere
Bottle after bottle, good weed up in the air
I see a bad bitch look at me when she stare
So I'm a go and say a couple things in her ear
I tell her I'm the man, and that I run the town
You think about it, I can change your life right now
And if your nigga trip then best believe it's goin down
If shit get outta line, there ain't no need to go around
Just come and...

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2:]
Ay, aye
Grippin on this honey while I'm puffin my reefer
Youngin talk money, ya the homie bilingual?
If she lookin like a hungry hoe, that's how I treat her
No I don't need her, go on off the meter
I don't chase hoes, chase cheese like the cheetah
You be all polite, sayin please when you meet her
I don't even greet her, just look her in the face
Pull her to the side, let her give my blunt a taste
Ask her what she drank, a little this, alotta that
Forget about a shot cause we got bottles in the back
Shawty swallow some of that, and get low
And move that thing around like a certified pro
Cigarello full of dro, so what u wan' do?
Your girls kno the biz, you can bring your girls too
And you can do you, cause they gon' do me
Id rather do y'all, I'm down for all three
Just come and...

[Hook x7]

Talk to me [echo]
