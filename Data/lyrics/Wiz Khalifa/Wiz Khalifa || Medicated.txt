[Intro]
You be anything you want
Uhh
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
Uhh
It don't stop here nigga
Yeah
Uhh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your words will never break
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it
Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hate it roll one up and celebrate

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that beverage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of the no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe at the Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twisting marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we on us
Got em acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in no hole
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me Illustrate.
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holdin' on to heat
Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf
All I won do is get high all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crokin' I just had to make it known
And they hit the studio to show they happy to be home

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin fuck the ones who hate it roll one up and celebrate

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded
