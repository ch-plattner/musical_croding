[Hook:]
I woke up in a bed full of bitches that I ain't even fuckin'
Fell asleep in a bed full of bitches that I ain't even fuckin'
Like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy
I smoke a joint and rap the band around my motherfucking head like Jimmy

Niggas mad at me cause the hoes that I leave are so pretty
I'mma a bad ass, do my own thing when I'm in your city
Purple haze, I'm on purple haze
To come down, I'mma need a couple days
Bitches kissin' on me
Drinkin' liquor, take a nigga's pictures for me

[Hook]

Fuck you with my vest and my boots on
Skinny but it's wide and it's real long
Red wine got her zonin'
Flip my tongue, now she open
If she bad I want it
Ass fat, got my name tatted on it

[Hook]

Don't call my phone with that fuck shit, nigga
If you call my phone it better be about some money
It better be about a God damn appointment that I missed
Or your hand better be on fire
Don't call my phone with that fuck shit.com
Follow me at don't call my phone with that fuck shit
