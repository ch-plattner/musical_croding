Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill

[Kev Tha Hustla]
So baby come fly wit a nigga who space surf
She know how to dive she don't jump it face first, 
I let her log on and play wit my laptop ,
We so high up hands feelin the backdrop,
I roll a bat she catch balls like a backstop, 
D-12 baby and ya man juss a matchbox,
I get cash really honey this is me
I'm the drug she tha plug, she in love with tha d,
Never give it to her raw, no cs like tha weed, 
So don't be blind to the fact, 
Baby girl come and see, I get money wit an attitude that's mad cash 
But when you walked passed, I was like damn! 

She want me to give her my all
I'm talkin one night, no feelings involved, 
Early morn no passion, show her my flight school skills no crashin. 

[Bridge]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone, 
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on 
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin,

[Chorus]
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill

Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)

[Wiz Khalifa] 
Okay!
Uh oh, ery'thing taylor'd
Ruin no neighbors, hop inside and we'll fly where a bird or plane is, 
Watcha name is, and who ya came wit,
Listen, imma take you out and put you in that right position, no 
And tell ya nigga I ain't trippin,
Never fallin off, I ain't slackin on my pimpin,
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different,
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road,
Just to let you know, I think it's beautiful (beautiful)
Soon as I get home I'm rushin over like a head start, 
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa skip the bed part. 

I sharp shooter, young bret hart, 
Prolly would like ta, hollywood night cha,
Red eye flight cha, somewhere near we can get lost and let chu pop off 
Go, 

[Bridge]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone, 
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on 
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin,

[Chorus]
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill

Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) 
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)
