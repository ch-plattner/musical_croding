Yea, yea
You know the saying, everything's foreign
I ain't gotta tell you, I'm a let Wiz explain

[Hook:]
I get it back, that's why I blow it
Her ass fat, that's why she throw it
Money long like I grow it
That's why a young nigga ridin' in a foreign
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)
Young nigga ridin' in a foreign
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)
Young nigga ridin' in a
Foreign, foreign, foreign
Ridin' in a foreign, foreign, foreign

Porsche, Maserati, or a (why?)
Damn, brand new Ferrari or a? Lambo!
Nigga got bread
(Shooters like don't get close to that new Testarossa
That Mercedes-Benz come with a chauffeur)
I be sparkin' in an Aston-Martin
Gettin' head like it's nothin', push the button, park it

[Hook]

Whipin', whippin'
I swear to God I be dippin', dippin'
In that new Marcy-elago, we ride foreign
Nelly Furtado hit the gas
Hear the tires screechin'
This ain't even my weekday car, this for the weekend
I got so many horses
All the whores say that it's gorgeous
In the air, that's where my doors is
SHIT!

[Hook]
