
Pop champagne, roll some weed up
We in a slow game, I bring the speed up
High octane, hella inked up
Bird or plane, u prolly seen us
Made a lil change, but it's all good
Neva throw it in your face I'm from a small Hooood
Best dressed like a star should, beat on so I could hardly see ya'll
We Are, Some Taylor Gang fukkin bosses
And I live everyday not caring wat it costest
Pop more bands, Cop more cloths,
Drive fast cars, Fuck bad hoes
I fly in circles u non workers in dirt last
Readin tweets and fallin asleep in first class
Might of heard my song but alot of ya'll ain't kno the kid
So I took over the net like Hova did
And set my goals where the solar is
Now my swag on polar bear
And you here so pretend ya man don't even exist
And get your lips wet like a lisp
I'm just like a pimp, some dislike from them
But I'm a big fish, u just Tiger Shrimp
Flirted with fame but at night I dream of success
If u sleepin on me then u gettin good rest
Yes
Cause when niggas ask who hot if it ain't Drizzy then they talkin bout me
Okaaaay
Hahaa
