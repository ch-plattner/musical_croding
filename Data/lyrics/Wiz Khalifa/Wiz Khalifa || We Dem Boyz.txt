[Verse 1:]
Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle (pop a bottle)
Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck and swallow (if you suck it)
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow (they gon follow)
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto (the lottery)
Pussy must be serious (hol' up)
Scared of heights come face your fears (hol' up, hol' up)
Do it just like Nicki go'n n bend it over (bus' it wide)
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner (smoking now)
Young nigga but I'm ready (but I'm ready)
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy (you sexy)
And white girls gimme becky (Becky)
But first I gotta roll this joint, babe, Hol up, hol up

Hol up, hol up, hol up, you drive me crazy (drive me crazy)
Number 1, bitch you can't replace me (can't replace me)
Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me (why you playin)
You got a ass so fat let's make a baby (And another one)
Damn, I'm smokin weed in my mercedes
Hol up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man they money slim, they actin shady
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race?
Ho, bitch you ain't come up from so why you showin up?

Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol up, man did you see her interior?
