[Verse 1: Nesby Phips]
Bone Snaps and crane kicks, divine intervention I was put here to change shit. 
? Draped up in the same fit, 
been rockin it for days now and will until the pay stop. 
See there's no dinner or winner for second place huh? 
Yea that what I figure so I handle my business. 
Confidentiality, all my plans to get richer. 
Then I, Master my role as my plan unfold. 
Right moves, make sure the left hand don't know. 
Words from a wiser predecessor: Never let up. 
I know how to spot a fool cuz he never shut up. 
If you speak it, you don't know it. You know it, you don't speak it. 
Can't feel me if you put your vertebrae on the speakers. 
See it got to be, and your nine on ya. 
I got higher than Chong on bongs in California. 
Catch me in your in local cool spots cata corner? 
Virgins to the herb frown at that aroma. 
For those inquisitive, scoot closer to Phips a bit. 
I invite you to get higher than what you've experienced. 

[Chorus:]
Um, There's some who think they smoke, but We stay Higher. 
And some think they get fly, but We get Flyer. 
They lookin for the Planes, We done cruised right by ya. 
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say Noooo. (Nooo) 
It's everywhere We goooo. 

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Woke up in the mornin' 
some ashes in the sink, couple drinks we was pourin' in. 
My niggas sleep, bitches rollin weed while I'm Yawnin'. 
It's just a routine after a night of performin'. 
I turn the hotel into a Polo Party. 
Makin' them eggs with cheese, let 'em smoke so much weed. 
Them hoes think we in the '70s. 
Big Dog, better pedigree. 
She in this king size bed with me. 
Give her space boy, Let her breathe. 
And I mean that technically, 
roll up the trees, like my weed grown medically. 
Less of the seeds, Niggas still got the hatin' disease, 
when actually they know. 
bite or bark, fight or heart 
Imma keep rollin' trees nigga, light or spark. 
Taylor in my walk, karate in my Talk. 
Now that's gangsta. 

[Chorus:]
Um, There's some who think they smoke, but We stay Higher. 
And some think they get fly, but We get Flyer. 
They lookin for the Planes, We done cruised right by ya. 
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say Noooo. (Noooo) 
It's everywhere We goooo.
