Whats up
What's happenin' Jeezy?
I just touched down
These hoes on me Jeezy for real

[Hook: Jeezy]
What I'm supposed to do
These haters on me
They make it so bad, these bitches want me
Spent the whole 30 grand, blew the whole key
When I fell up in the spot, the 40 on me
What I'm supposed to do
These haters on me
What I'm supposed to do
These bitches want me
What I'm supposed to do
These haters on me
What I'm supposed to do
These bitches want me

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
There be no hatin', no fakin', no lyin', no snitchin'
You play with it, you go there, you cross line, I'm trippin'
Them [?] try long clips, I'm going straight loco
You dead broke, I'm world wide, you loco
I'm grindin', I'm stuntin', I'm flexin'
Them bitches you came with? They all in my section
They smokin', we drinkin', they turnt up, they simpin'
She spilled Don P on me, I said bitch you trippin'
My weed costs, my belt costs, my jeans cost a grip bitch
And you know that four cal is right here on hip bitch
Two door cost half mil that there be rich shit
Don't know me? You hate me? That there be bitch shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh my God look what I just bought
Another Presidential Rollie don't ask what it costs
And you might get lost, come into my crib
I'm just a young nigga gettin' it how I live
I'm supposed to stackin', supposed to be grindin'
Supposed to be swaggin', supposed to be shinin'
Supposed to be way up ahead of my game
While you in back, or stuck in the line
Spendin' this cash, I'm in this bitch rollin' my grass up
Clubs so packed in there can't no one get past us
Oh, I'm with my whole crew
Spent 30 thousand in the club that's what I'm supposed to do
Say fuck the chase, I drink it straight like what I'm supposed to do
If you made what I make a show you'd prolly throw it too

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I told a bitch to bring her friend like what I'm supposed to do
I bought a bottle, drink it straight like what I'm supposed to do
I hit the club on hella hoes like what I'm supposed to do
And VIP be rolling drugs like what I'm supposed to do
You see me drivin' foreign cars like what I'm supposed to do
A hundred deep up in this bitch can't see me rollin' through
This nigga trippin', took his bitch like what I'm supposed to do
A young rich nigga, I'm buying for my whole crew
And I'll serve a nigga pound if he roll through
Real niggas with me and they well known too
And if I'm smokin' one you best believe she smokin' too
A million dollars worth in one summer's what I'm supposed to do

[Hook]
