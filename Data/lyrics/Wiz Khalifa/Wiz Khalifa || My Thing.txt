[Chorus:]
I'm doin' my thing you should be doin' you
Gettin' my change
You should be doin' you
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you
Why you hatin' on me dog I'm just doin' what it do
There's money to be made so I'm stackin' to the sky
Smokas all day boy you know I stay high
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you
Why you hatin' on me I'm just doin' what it do

You know me as the prince
Young but livin' large
A couple different broads
The youngest in charge
Live is just a game
I'm weighin' out the odds
They say it ain't the hand deal but how you play your cards
And me I'm goin' hard
You cats are livin' lies
Money to be made so I'm stackin' to the sky
Rap and gettin' high
Employed by the O
You niggas pay the high
I got it on the low
Hit the gas flowin dro
Bitch I'm from the burgh
Raised in the hood
Now my crib is in the burbs
The haters talkin' down they gonna get what they deserve
It's over for you clowns
So as my niggas get the word
I made it this far
By stayin' in my lane
Since I was thirteen I've been the player in the game
And now I'm gettin' change
High and gettin' loose
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you

[Chorus]

I'm into fast car
Speakers in the trunk
Eye out for polices cause I'm keefin' on this blunt
Give the people what they want
That's why we gettin' cake
Catch me in the lab Benji got my money straight
And niggas gonna hate
Khalifa gonna ball
Shipped from over seas you won't see it at the mall
Bitch I'm so fly only see em' if I fall
Hater in my way I ain't see them at all
The key is with the boss
Been certified coke
You make a nigga liar
A certified joke
And the word is ya'll broke
So they ain't in my lead
I'm one amazin' teams
The major and seem and see
My face on magazines
My team we get it done
Make it look easy like we do this shit for fun
But we do this shit for fun
The green back loose
Why you worried about me
You should be doin' you

[Chorus]
