I'ma uh
More places than I've ever been
More money than I could ever spend
More hotels than I could ever rent
More bitches than I could ever sleep... with
More faces than I could ever know
More weed than I could ever blow
More fans from grow a every show
And we go...
I'm so high, so high...
Oh oh off the glow, glow...
No one pulling me down, me down..
Smoking, smoking...
Chilling, chilling...
Up at the top of the world, the world...
Oh oh off the glow
No one pulling me down, me down...
Growing, growing...
We're cheating, cheating
Somebody dreaming
But you just living
