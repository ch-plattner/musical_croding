[Hook - Chris Brown:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Tyga:]
Looking back now, know you hear me, wanna see me smile
Hold me down, keep me save when I'm down, not a sound
Ever since you was a child, always had your back 'til now
Should've kept the circle round, now it's like you're not around
Used to run it through the town, toughest little dudes around
Always thought you had a daughter
Sure to teach her what they taught us
Had a son he getting smarter, everyday more like his father
Know this game and keep it solid, present faith you know you got it
Big things come back again but ain't the same
I tell myself, "remain the same and keep it sane"
Know it's hard when your dog ain't there to bark with ya
Seems like yesterday we was all in pictures

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa:]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Hook]
