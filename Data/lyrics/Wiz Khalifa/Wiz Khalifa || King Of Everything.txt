Wake up in the morning, grab my trees and I get to it
Young nigga, I do my own thing so let me do it
If you wanna know a thing about me, I'm 'bout my paper
Fuck a bitch, soon as my iPhone ring I see you later
Hop on in the Chevy, grab my keys and then I'm outtie
First thing, If it's 'bout that cheese, then I'm about it
I be stacking up, got no time for niggas hating
Low we backing up, keep that clean and watch some Daytons
Cruising down the street, hear my car before it's coming
Fuck the police, windows down, I'm smoking something
And my bitch bad, she gon' ride If shit get crazy
Goons messed up, they gon' slide you try to play me
Since a young nigga, kept that pack up in the telly
Since a young nigga, been had tats like Makaveli
Shoot for fun nigga
My niggas bust, you better run nigga
King of fucking everything

Young rich nigga, smoking weed when I wanna [x4]

When I touch down, have that pack, you fucking with me
Fuck the bitch once, she talkin' about she love with me
Let her smoke weed, drink champagne, do drugs with me
We go out of town, dinner at TAO, do clubs with me
What you niggas think, got more bank than And more ranks
Smoking weed with some bitches in the club who don't drink
Talkin' about they get money, they got expensive taste
So I put it in her mouth and sent 'em both on their way
I'll be there for one night, don't give a fuck if I stay
Spent a couple hundred thousand in a couple of days
Smoke a pound in my suite and then come up with a plate
Bitch came over to my crib and had a comfortable stay
She feeling my car, she feeling my chain
She think I'm a star, I'm feeling the same
I take her abroad, I fuck her insane
I'm switching up broads, I'm killing the game
Long range
King of fucking everything

Young rich nigga, smoking weed when I wanna [x4]
