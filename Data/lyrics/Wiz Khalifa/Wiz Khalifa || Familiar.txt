[Chorus:]
I am in the air
All I want is the money
And I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder
Mind on a million
Taylor gang in the planes
You know we over the building

They ask me how I'm fly
I'm a tell ya
You recognize game
I should be lookin familiar

If they ask me how I'm fly
I'm a tell ya
You recognize a G
I should be lookin familiar

Party and chillin'
And fast living it
How I'm supposed to, now the choice is given
I chose to, leave the club with a couple of hoes who
Love to smoke trees rolling the easy rider papers
Maintain a low speed
Now shall I proceed?
Come from a city where niggaz ain't got a lot
But got it locked
So I be low key, uh
Money hoes clothes, is all a nigga knows
Don't bring a nug, I blow it by the O
I hit the road, cause shit is exactly how it seems
While cats been sleepin on me
I've been living out my dream
The marijuana's liable but my surroundings are serene
I'm laughin' and smokin'
Hopin' my camera catch the scene
Fresh up off the plane
Flick another paper
Shorty wanna ride with me
As bad as I wanna take her
Put you in demand
Bitches taken flicks with the planes
And send them to their friends
Weed to grind
Mind on a million
And we over the building

[Chorus:]
I am in the air
All I want is the money
And I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder
Mind on a million
Taylor gang in the planes
You know we over the building

They ask me how I'm fly
I'm a tell ya
You recognize game
I should be lookin familiar

If they ask me how I'm fly
I'm a tell ya
You recognize a G
I should be lookin familiar
