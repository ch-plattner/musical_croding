[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My dawgs scroll up, my dawgs roll up
Your dawgs ain't loyal, your dawgs fall short
Man them niggas ain't my niggas
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs
Man them niggas ain't my niggas
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs
My dawgs on point, my dawgs don't slip
Your dawgs won't call, your dawgs gon' flip
Man them niggas ain't my niggas
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs
Man them niggas ain't my niggas
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Man them niggas ain't my niggas
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs
That's why I roll up all by myself
I don't be rollin with yal
I be always smoking green
I be always lighting up
Niggas reaching out their hands
They don't know me
Them niggas ain't real
Them niggas gon' fall
Them niggas ain't ride
Them niggas don't ball
Them niggas ain't got your back
Them niggas gon' set you up
My niggas they all got heart
Your niggas ain't got enough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Currensy]
If you ain't all the way down then get from round
Jogging pants I run the town
My home girl dancing in the ace so she making money now
I like a hustling ass bitch so we fucking now
79 Malibu make it bunny hop
To the dog house that's the money spot
I run up get that money
Really living what I'm talking bout
The driveway look like a parking lot
I block my own Bentley and I got to let myself out
[?] power myself with all the fucking handout
So fuck what a pussy nigga crying bout
Jetlife, Taylor Gang til' he carry me out

[Hook]
