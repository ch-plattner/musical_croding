
I dream of cush blunts, hot fashion and females
She never smoked one below way the weed smells
Pistols in the front, chopper on the back porch
Lord knows I wanna teach him but he asked for
... words, let my money do the talking
I think the game needs some change like you kill for parking
We're to blame, you motherfuckers ground control
We escape, skip the rates, pick a cloud and go
My... bow ratio, bisexual, bad everything I want soon as I let them know
I snap my fingers and God wild be there to...
Call me the deep and you try and sing like the London Bridge
Big city smoke problems, hate me cause I get a plate off it
What are they starving? Where I'm at?... say you got another question,.. it
Ask me if I'm falling
Wow.
