[Verse 1: Wiz]
Baby I go, hard
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all
Cause we done made it, too far
Got something to say then fuck 'em
Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'

[Hook x2: Courtney]
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

[Verse 2: Wiz]
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you
Take you places where they using different language to greet you
Smile and shake when they meet you
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me
Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Courtney]
Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure
You don't even have to call me, just say my name
I'll be right there waiting for you

[Hook x4]
