Aye, now I could say my name but (say my name but)
Your bitch already knows it (knows it)
Got no problem spending paper (paper)
I got it so I blow it (I blow it)

Shawty what's your name, put your number in my sidekick
Captain of the spaceship, your fuckin' with the pilot
Say she wanna ride well, I can give her milage
Plus I live the star life, won't u come an try it
Say I'm wrong, I can do that pussy right
And within another time zone, I can be there by tonight
Beat it I can light, cuple bottles of patrone
Do sum things tonight, no problem 'cus we grown
So Imma pass go
and if u feel the way I feel, then let's quit talkin' bout it
shawty let's go
Do u like it fast slow
say she got a need for speed
and if I can't drive, then Imma need a crash course, oh
So I threw it on her, shawty threw it back
at her freaky shit
U do it to me, Imma do it back
and them scratches gon' ruin the tattos that's on my back
So I don't know what with it, but u know how to act

Looks like I'm here with you all night long
And I wanna see you, so I beat it with the lights on
and ain't no tease, I wanna be ya main attraction
Roll camara please, I think it's time for sum action, sum action
looks like I've been with u all night long,
And I wanna see you, so I beat it with the lights on
and ain't no tease I wanna be ya main attraction
Roll camera please, I think it's time for sum action, sum action, whoa

Then we can play it right back
I hope your kitty cat mean so I can bite back
Take off them jeans drink this night cap
say men are from mars, you can be my venus fly track
damn your grip tight
let me put it on u slow and let me speed up at the light
girl your body look to right to try to even put a price on
So I just leave the lights on

I have u tryin' different kinds of shit when u make it up in my room
I told u girl that Imma hit it in high definition
keep your lines in your head but in the bed we get unscripted, aye
Beat while they home I don't take 'em out to dinna
I need shawty on my camera, aye

Looks like I'm here with you all night long
And I wanna see you, so I beat it with the lights on
and ain't no tease, I wanna be ya main attraction
Roll camara please, I think it's time for sum action, sum action
looks like I've been with u all night long,
And I wanna see you, so I beat it with the lights on
and ain't no tease I wanna be ya main attraction
Roll camera please, I think it's time for sum action, sum action
wooohaaaaahhh
