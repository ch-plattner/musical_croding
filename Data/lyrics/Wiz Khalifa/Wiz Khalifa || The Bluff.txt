[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so much
I got so much
I got so much
I got so much

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, still the same nigga
Still walking all upon your airplane with all my gang members
Smelling like, money and champagne
Part of my campaign
I'm fucking rich my nigga
Some things I can't change
Sometimes I swear I be so fly I mean I can't change
Sometimes I feel I've got a couple people I can't shame
Still rolling weed in a pair of J's
Gettin' ashes all over my favorite jeans
I ain't mad my nigga
I am getting paid, crib with the maid
It's all the same shit, different day
Keep hearing 'bout what these niggas doin'
But them niggas gone, and I'm here to stay
(I'm here to stay)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I got me a whole one
So I'm 'bout to roll one
As soon as you jump in the ride with me
Now you gettin' lifted, and you feelin' different
As soon as you want you can drive you'll see
I got so much
(Yeah, yeah)
I got so much
(Yeah, yeah)
I got so much

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I told her leaving God (Bye)
Or she can stay and breathe
She looked and said, Cam you don't know what to say to me
(Oh really?) Paparazzi oh baby girl, no playing please
Now point that camera at my pockets cause they saying "cheese"
Put up your life we gambling, next time we out here scrambling
I'm Killah, he Wiz, but all our checks are Cam'rom
Next chapter, next chapter, f-f-f-fatigues and cannons
Fresh rapper, fresh rapper right here where I'm standing
You play? We playin'
Drop by on the way that waving
New five, that's how we playin'
We have wave, I'm just saying
What you sayin'? What I'm sayin'?
Money holds clothes and mayhem
Amen! Please have her on her knees, and she ain't prayin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I got me a whole one
So I'm 'bout to roll one
As soon as you jump in the ride with me
Now you gettin' lifted, and you feelin' different
As soon as you want you can drive you'll see
I got so much
(Yeah, yeah)
I got so much
(Yeah, yeah)
I got so much
