[Chorus:]
You think you do it big
I guarentee I do it bigger
I'm all about my money
Yea I'm all about my figgas
I'm screamin fuck the law
Till the law come n get us
And a nigga goin hard dog
So ya'll ain't fuckin with em

[Verse 1:]
And I know u hate it
Never needed a hand out unlike most who made it
And ya'll close to fading
You see how I get my grind on, now my shine on
I don't know what shade is,
Damn an everybody know what my name is
Goin off what I been told I'm sort of famous
Trips to forign places, when niggas found out that warner laced us
I swear to god I wish I culda saw they faces, we in the money racing,
Me I'm gonna chase it, we done made it to the top floor from the basement,
This for my lil cuzin hot boy stuck in placement, time is money so we not really gon waste it,
I'm on the road, gettin my chavo niggas wanna hate but they jus listen to nado,
I'm rhyme that sick, n fire that spliff up n fuck what u heard bout me I'm that nigga

[Chorus:]
You think you do it big
I guarentee I do it bigger
I'm all about my money
Yea I'm all about my figgas
I'm screamin fuck the law
Till the law come n get us
And a nigga goin hard dog
So ya'll ain't fuckin with em
Know y know y
Cus I'm that nigga
Gon ask about me
I'm that nigga know y know y
Cus I'm that nigga
Gon ask about me
I'm that nigga know y know y

[Verse 2:]
Aye aye and u ain't heard otherwise, I'm one hundred here nothin like them other guys,
Jus talkin money wise, that's all that makes sense, I'm on my 8th spliff status on sum great shit,
But never felt the need to fall back, niggas gettin all that, sum coming taking all that,
Now your fam a big fan of the tall cat, an my pittsburgh tat match the ball cap,
Hatin n all that will getcha ass nowhere, an if I'm n the spot guarentee I'm blow there,
My future is so clear, the sky is the limit, they hear me rappin say this young guy here is gifted,
28 weeks nigga I'm am the sickest, young motherfucker that's alive an is kickin,
Fire a spliff an roll another siwsher, you ain't gotta ask about me u know I'm that nigga

[Chorus]
