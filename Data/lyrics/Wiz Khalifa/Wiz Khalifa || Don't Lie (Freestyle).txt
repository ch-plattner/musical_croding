Goin to shop for that fly shit.
If it's private I'm flying it. If I like it I'm buying it
If it's foreign I'm driving it. If it's potent, I'm smokin it.
That '69 interior look sexy as hell when you open it.

Rippin jeans and takin drags. Poppin tags and makin swag
On the internet erryday and you fuck niggas still make us laugh.
I ain't really wanna talk shit but the shit I bought just make us brag.
Clothes small but my money long with my gold tooth and my nappy head
'For I see you thinkin that's a seat. Nigga like me treated like a bed.
Wake me up when it's time to eat. Only Nigga In First Class.
