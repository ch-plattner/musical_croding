it's young Khalifa man, i know i say that before every song but that's really actually who the fuck I am so
uh uh
damn it feels good to be a Taylor
to rock camo shorts, chuck tee and smoke papers
weed comin' in all flavors
fall up in the spot as long as the champagnes there
couple pretty hoes I don't know their name here
smell the weed, see two fingers know my gang near
yeh you ballin' but they ain't cheer
i guess they tired of rootin' for the same players
real niggas run up on me at my shows, hoes show me love, promoters give me plane fare,
i'm somewhere at the top i'm planning on stayin' there
mouth full of kush ridin' in my favorite pair
and this is for anyone who scene a nigga vision from the begining realize that you made it clear
laugh now fly later, damn it feels good to be a taylor

and that's what it is man, taylor gang or die
damn it feels good to be a taylor
so ya'll just catchin' on it's all good

taylor gang world wide
you know i had to do something strictly for the fans
i'm workin' on my album right now
i made kush and orange juice go through the roof
i'm smokin' some sour kush

i'm smokin' one got another one rolled,
(it's really go sour)
seein' tickets to every show so
they won't sleep till we let them know
(so roll up, you know)
now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go
(do what we do)
i'm smokin' one got another one rolled,
(keep it Taylor man)
seein' tickets to every show so
(2010)
they won't sleep till we let them know
(this years almost over so next year)
now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go

we just gonna' be doin' the same shit but like on a higher level
and that was a weed joke
