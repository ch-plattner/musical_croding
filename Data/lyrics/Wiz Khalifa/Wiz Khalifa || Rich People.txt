I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good, had it made
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg I was in the hood everyday
But now I'm hopping offa Jets
These people cutting me checks
And I say people cause I'm rich
And rich people show me respect (Show me respect)
This come from Atrium, he's from Collette
These diamonds I got on, they are baguettes
On DBS so all of 'em see me, used to be just be that dude on the net
Now I'm all on your TV, butler and ask what I wanna get, Bentley or Lamborghini?
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all on Luigi
Smoking on 8 ounces told myself ain't often that sleepy
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me
That's why all the people that you know try their hardest to be me

Cause nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg now roll up the herb

Welcome to my house party (party)
Welcome to my house party (party)
