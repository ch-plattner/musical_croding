[Intro]
Yeah! All this Louis Vuitton
I see clearly now, hahahaha
Ocean view, you deserve it
I do this for you

[Verse 1]
Say the trees couldn't get better
Need this sort of weather
Sand beneath your toes, your drinks come with umbrellas
Cutting off our phones, ignoring important texts and email messages
Say I do it big, I can't do it less than this
Them other niggas talking shit
You ain't impressed with them
Yet to spend and we been up for a minute
That explains all the trips I invested in
It's funny how all the fussing and fighting
Turned around into us fucking and flying
Every night on the road you call me up and you crying
Was worried about them bitches
Now you too busy picking diamonds
And don't worry 'bout a price
Cause if you want it I got it and I'mma pay for it
The good weed's lit, the champagne's poured
Order whatever you want if you got a taste for it
It's every girl's dream, but you awake for it

[Hook]
Fly you to where I am
I-I-I'll fly you!
Fly you to where I am
I-I-I'll fly you!
Fly you to where I am
I-I-I'll fly you!
Fly you to where I am
I-I-I'll fly you!

[Verse 2]
And you know how it goes
I go harder than a bitch - pardon my French
But I go hard for this
You never had to see me on the starving artist shit
But mama when you caught me cheating
Thought that you would call it quits
Knew fucking with me that you was taking all the risks
So you ain't try to give in
Saying I'll be straight and you'll be the one hurt in the end
And that's no good!
Just tryna put you on the game like a coach would
Everything going just how it should, now your friends jealous
They hating on us but we so far they can't tell us
The life we living it was made for us
When you're ready, give me a call and I'll be waiting on it
All you gotta do is hit me when you land
And I'll pick you up from the airport
And take you straight to the villa, we don't stay at resorts
5-star suites, spend weeks at the day spa
Mama keep your day job, I'mma..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And no matter where we go, you
Say you never been
She in love, cause I keep it G
Not cause the G's that I spend
But I do spend G's on expensive weed
Vintage sneaks and hotel room keys
Came for a date, spend a whole week
Red-eye, no sleep - window seat

[Hook]
