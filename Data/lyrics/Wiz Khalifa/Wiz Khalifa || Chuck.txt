Big house, 4 whips, hella tattoos
Smoke good and ya bitch think I’m bad news
Bout to go nuts, nigga, Cashews
A ? ask me if I’m book I say I’m past due
Maserati look mean and it’s fast too
Cinderella bout to get that bitch some glass shoes
Niggas acting mushy like cat food
Niggas acting pussy like cats do
Get a little money nigga, that's cool
For putting ya niggas on, yeah you really that dude
Smoking 2 L’s, living large
See my watch and wanna know how much it really cost
AP that’s an Audemar
Agents callin’ bitch I’m ballin’ like I’m Stoudemire
Store running out of papers cause I bought em all
Niggas claiming that they Taylor’s but they not at all
Not far from the ree that's where the apple falls
Say the wrong words so guys knock ya apple off
No sweetener straight apple sauce
Doing movie roles, rapper slash actor dog
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I’m growing weed up in my car
And getting high

If I die today, remember me like Jimi Hendrix
Butt-ass nekkid covered in all bad bitches

[Chevy Woods]
Chevy!
I’m praying for you niggas
I put that on my Rosary
Flash like diamonds, tell me what you tryna see
Us high beams?, this a pinky though
Washing machine work, I keep a couple lows
Foreign bitch, she don’t even talk
She just drop the money off and got a sexy walk
365, no days off
Shit I’m the reason they say hard work pays off
28 to 56 is what I learn first
[?] You see just how that work surf?
Oh I’m some big shit, Notorious
Get you some gunplay bastard and glorious
I got the top chopped off riding [?]
[?] riding shotgun, oh that's your broad
Bright lights, dead charley?
Ignorant white, Bill O Reilly

[Neako]
I’m kinda high
They looking for me, I was probably in the sky
I’m always fried when I hop in that double S
I can be there in a minute
Pepsi blue, I’m the ice cube riding in it
Lightly tinted, I be ghost
Blowing smoke, calling them bitches up
Dick em down when I pick em up
Never keep ‘em close
Hit em and then I switch em up
Audemars bruh, Wizzles riding in Pick up trucks
Riding puff bus, tough luck you dumb fucks
Never came up, while we riding on planes bruh
Yeah we counting hundreds
A lot of hundreds, these niggas know that we run it
We never blunted
Smoking them raws cause we raw
Never flaw, fly as you ever saw
Real life we riding real cars
Hustle hard for muscle cars
Fuck the best broads
Blowin’ O’s at all cost
Natural born stars, what they sayin’, yeah!
(Sayin’ yeah)
