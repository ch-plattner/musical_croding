Yea 

Worried bout a hater? Not me 
Turned to the max, no sleep 
Smoked a hundred joints to the face 
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say 

Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (what?) 

Rolling, pockets swollen 
Riding in it like it’s stolen 
Weeded, hella conceded 
If it ain’t about money, nigga I don’t need it 
Got a hundred grand in my ashtray 
Spend a hundred K on a bad day 
And I’m tied up like a cholo 
Nigga act crazy, my dogs go loco 
Kush got me moving slow mo 
What my nigga Poblem? That’s my bro bro 
Came in through the backdoor 
Ten mill this year on the low low 
And I’m still smoking free rolls 
Krissed out, dumb fucking with the cliko 
And my bank full of zeros 
Young Wiz will get fly like a hero 

Worried bout a hater? Not me

Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (bout me) 
Everything about me (what?) 

Parling tongue with the mull, light a donut 
So my weed that you is ever smoked up 
Didn’t make a chocker 
Like a real low ride brother, feeling like a mil up a pill 
Don’t lock, we ain’t letting all my bros in 
But for sure we’ll let yall hoes in 
Guess when you pulling money out, baby loving it 
Give a dick fore I give a bitch my government (what?) 
That’s 8, I got 8 more 
Super-duper hot, 88 floor 
Unzip this, that’s 8 more 
Fuck a pussy and fuck rhymin 
We gon live forever, fuck dyin 
Get it til I drop, fuck tryin 
Pedal to the metal, we flyin 
In the fast lane, yelling (diamond!)

Youg wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth 
Treenbay.com, like to swap meat 
Goin crazy on a bitch until she knock me 
I’m in that hella fast whip goin top speed 
Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean 
I drop racks and she drop G’s 
Smoke green as I lean, top droppin 
Nigga I am all about a buck, falling out a truck 
Probly with some hoes that I just met and yea they all gon fuck 
Got a man calling up the homies, blowing all the mug 
Tryna figure outwhich girl is, she probably toasted 
Uh, like a champagne glass 
So much money, there ain’t a damn thing sap 
Do my damn thing in my campaign add 
Let’s get straight to it, don’t let a damn thing past me (what?)
