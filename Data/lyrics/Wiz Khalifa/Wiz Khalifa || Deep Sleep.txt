Deep sleep

[Verse 1]
How you gon’ be cold as us?
Your kush ain’t rolled up
Your cars ain’t old enough
Champagne ain’t cold enough
Money still fold up
You ain’t buying no clubs
You ain’t getting no love
But my niggas so thug
You ain’t getting thrown up
Smell me when I roll up
I glow like Leroy
My fro like Sho’ Nuff
Can’t get poured up
Everything slowed up
Fuck niggas hate us
Rich niggas know us
I’m riding with gangstas
So I don’t need no cup
I’m drinking out the bottle
Riding with the top down
Smoking on A.C
Twenty five thousand
‘Bout to blow it out in A.C
Niggas join us cause they can’t beat us
Ain’t nann nigga play me
Keep talking them pounds
I’m blowing that daily
I’m smoking that good reefer
My eyes all lazy
Niggas see me getting that money
So they look at me crazy
My niggas out here stunting
Doing drugs all mainey
I’m buying brand new cars and shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I get high all day, I ain’t coming down
The tweak is heavy, it’s going ’round
Rolling up airplanes, bout to catch an airplane
Riding in my old-school, listening to old school
Doing it how a G’s supposed to do
It’s getting cold, I might close the roof
Made it up to first class, staying in first class
Remember when I ain’t have first class, now I’m the only nigga in first class
Started with a bus pass, then I copped a old-school
Now I got so many cars, I ain’t got enough room
Twenty mil and got more to go
Roll some weed and then roll some mo’

[Hook]

[Outro]
I’m just going insane trying to figure you out, baby
