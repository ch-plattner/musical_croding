How many grams they asked you you had?
What you tell 'em?
28 right?

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Bad bitch come to my crib, handle my business
Let a nigga know shit's real, handle my business
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business
Smokin' pounds of kush, handle my business
Ridin' in a brand new car, woosh, handle my business
Handle my business, handle my business, handle my business

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin' on the kush, ridin' in a brand new whip
Feelin' like a pimp
[?] money good
[?] bitch nigga would, [?] bitch nigga would
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business
Handle my business, got a handful of Benji's
Hand on the strap, I'mma handle that witness
I'mma handle that car, I'mma handle that bitch
She gonna handle this dick
After that, roll some weed up
Chill with my feet up
Ya'll some hand-me-down niggas
Posted in the car with the top down smokin' on the shit that'll paralyze niggas

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]
High as fuck and it's 28 grams later
Keep the Ruger, I'mma shoot it in a damn skater
I'm from the Chi but Atlanta where I'm gonna take her
If I put her on the corner then I'm gonna break her
(Make her handle my business, straight up out the trenches
Young nigga tryna double my digits while I'm kickin' this pimpin')
Two white cups sippin', ride around piped up gettin' it
Chain so bright that it might cause tension
Brought the Benz all Spring, so they know it ain't rented
Feelin' like a Beatle, god damn, John Lennon
Put my finger on the trigger, I be sprayin' for a minute
I tell 'em, wait, wait, let me handle that
Little steak, Little eggs, let me scramble that
Two guns, two clips, finna rumble
Tell their hoes I'm bouta fire, where they candles at?
Where they candles at?
Cause I be sippin' on somethin'
Never been a Goofy, shootin' a movie
Table full of shroomies while I'm rollin' the doobie
You starin' at me like you wanna hit it or somethin'
Your bitch lookin' like she want the dinik or somethin'
I prolly give her the somethin' in addition to somethin'
Cookin' like I'm in the kitchen or somethin'
You lookin' broke boy, get you some money
Then I don't

[Hook]
