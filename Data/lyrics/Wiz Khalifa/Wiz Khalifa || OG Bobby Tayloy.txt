[Hook: Wiz Khalifa:]
What you smoking, nigga?
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG
God damn - what you smoking, nigga?
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Word - pull up on the corner smoking herb
Nigga, you scared
So high you talking shit, but I don't hear it
Hey, hey, wow, church
I'm smoking that shit from the Earth
Riding, no shirt, pussy ass niggas do your homework
Ooh hey, word on the streets, Khalifa's a beast
Shit, 'bout to go D-Wade, hit 'em with the heat
Fuck with me, I'm the realest, realest, nigga, I'm the realest
Blowing on killer while I'm listen to Killa
Body full of tattoos like a killer
Ho, word on the streets that I got these niggas upset
All my niggas from the bottom, from the projects
I take a bitch home, give her long dick, that long dick
Yes, hit it then I quit it
And when I'm in it get the pussy so wet think I'm 'bout to go swimming
God damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga got cash, talking big cash, nigga blow kush, talking big bags
Niggas still hating on a nigga, hit the weed once, do the Wiz laugh
Got faded in a mug, god damn I'm tailored up
Got - papers in my lungs, got it straight from the plug
Got - what you smoking, nigga?

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
This a whole P, it ain't no seeds
But on the real I'mma probably need the whole tree
Can't fuck with you acting like the police
The way your bitch pop the pussy, had to go see
It ain't nothing for your girl like ho, please
Let you down to do a favor like you owe me
Soul Train diamonds dancing in this AP
Taylor Gang, pussy nigga, you don't know me
Droptops with some twins in it
Ha, what you doing, boy, I been did it
Yeah, roll up, let your friends hit it
Ha, around my city, boy, I been did it
Man, I can't even lie, y'all don't get high like that
In the ride like that with a ride like that
Trey pound like that, but it's all in them raps
Stop lying to the people acting like you got the pack right now
[?] it's how you act a real round
Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins at the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the comments
Cause only killer they see is green
And they're gonna do anything for the commas
TGOD, now they wanna call the feds
I'm a king smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a bag full of trash
I was in the 9th grade smoking weed after class
Just a tilt door looking like the car on fire
This the weed mix, you gon' need a few lighters
You ain't never smoke no fucking KK, nigga
And we don't smoke no motherfucking AK, nigga
Word on the street buy whole one
Get good with the plug, you gon' throw one
Serve your homie who ain't never gon' say shit
Chef it up in the face like a shogun

[Hook]
