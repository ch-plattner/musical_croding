[Chorus:]
We poppin' rubber bands, spendin' money by the grand, what you make up in a week, nigga I got it in my pants! (Wiz- SO WE!) Poppin' rubber bands, spendin' money by grand, what you make up in a week, nigga I got it in my pants [x2]

You that time is money so a young nigga clock it! I'm ballin' in the game while them other just watchin'. You makin' in a week I got stuffed up in my pocket! The money ain't a thang, gettin' money's not an option.

I need a rubber band can't fit this money in a wallet! My bank account is makin' ya'll sick to ya stomach, gettin' rich and I love it, my piff got a budget and your bitch probly thinkin' about the prints, she ain't frontin'!

Homie you ain't seen nothin'! I'm blowin' on the overdose. Thirty five large and that's just for doin' a show with you. Talkin' how I live it now I'm gettin' it how I'm suppose to do. Shinin' like I know the do, grinden I could show you dudes!

Hit the mall up dawg spendin' money by the grand! Blow a couple stacks and pop another rubber band! Make it hard to understand, I ain't spend it like that. Niggas know me I'm the man and we gettin' it right back! So we!

[Chorus:]
We poppin' rubber bands, spending money by the grand, what you make up in a week, nigga I got it in my pants (Wiz- SO WE!) [x4]

I'm ballin' like a pro! Your doe is kinda minor. My money on the road lookin' something like a tire and they lovin' my atire! I'm lean in them verse but I switch to Micheal Veres and my vision got clearer! (Clearer) It's all about the paper man the paper need mirrors. Could never give a fuck about a hater, can't fear em'.
