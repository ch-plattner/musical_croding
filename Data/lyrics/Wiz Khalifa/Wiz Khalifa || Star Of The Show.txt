Loving you, is all I wanna do
Loving you, is all I wanna do

Yeeah
Ugh
Ugh
Ugh

See I’ve been going on and on for ever
them haters probably wonder when I’m gone stop, never!
most of it’s been good but I’ve seen some bad weather
and niggas watching now, wouldn’t even give me an umbrella
but I aint tripping, I made a million on my own
may come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
when I was 16, finna get put out my home
now the man making money, my nigga, my money growing
and I can do what I what, went form being hated on
to niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
aint no love lost but aint no love shown
so now when niggas call I just don’t pick up the phone
I’m breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
party every weekend, hardly ever home
don’t see me face to face so you have to talk about me when I gone

[Chorus]
stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
niggas who can’t support their own
so keep pay me from the crowd
everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-owww
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

The drinks poured up, weed’s rolled up
and all my jewelery ice to piece froze up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
have any nigga in the World but she chose us
I remember them same hoes aint even notice us
get you to buy us a drink than its over cuz
we back around the time that she sober’d up
shit aint been the same since the limosuine showed up
the best moments of my life
never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife
plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
it’s the way we know, wake up in the morn’
like “where did all my paper go”
grow some more weed and get medicated
everyday is a holiday so we celebrated

[Chorus]
