[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, I'm rich as fuck, drunk as hell
Throwin' money, pick it up, life is good, live it up
How much for that bottle? put it on my tab
Hop out like a model all them foreign tags
Get so drunk and high, I'll have to call a cab
You won't end up giving it back if you had this for one night

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ooo, we in the club goin' bizzurk
My OG sippin' on that sizzurp
I mix the OG with the pizzurp
I O.D. spilled it on my shizurt
Drinking Bombay so I'm slizzered
My diamond chain lookin' like a blizzard
So many rings, my fingers startin' to hizzurt
If you didn't know me you'd swear I had that wizzork
And I'm from Pittsburgh

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one then I'll light it, order one and I'll buy it
If it's green then I'll try it, too drunk then I'll drive
Don't know where I'm going, all I know is I'm flyin'
And that's as real as it gets, make you feel like you the shit for one night
