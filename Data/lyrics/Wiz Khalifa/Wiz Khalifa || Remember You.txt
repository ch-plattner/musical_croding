[Intro - The Weeknd]
She’s about to earn some bragging rights
I’m ’bout to give it up like I’ve been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you wanna do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don’t mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My tongue slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I’m wiping sweat from my last show
And he’s TG and I’m XO
I’m only here for one night
Then I’mma be your memory
Say it in my ears, so I can hear what you’re saying to me
I got cups full of that Rose
Smoke anything that’s passed to me
Don’t worry ’bout my voice
I won’t need it for what I’m about to do to you

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don’t have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just have to laugh
Niggas after fame, I’m after cash
You’s a fan, I'm a player
I’m the man, you’s a hater
And I only smoke papers
That’s how you tell that I'm tailored
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes out without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that’s paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you’re rolling one up while you’re singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You’re taking too long
Young and I’m rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

Good to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I’m on some gin, you on some gin
I’m moving slow, I’m driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
Not Motor 1, not old Chevelle
Can’t say things are like supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
It means haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won’t remember tomorrow

Good to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Used to you
Through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Used to you
Through with you
Memory, remember you
