
I be rollin
Riden
Flow so fly I be so so high
She say im that guy you wanna ride with
Like my car get inside it
U excited
I dont blame you 
Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too
I dont wanna date you 
I just wanna take you home n do somethin grown folks can relate too
Bitch I'ma play you
I would hate to 
But if you stay cool we should be straight boo
Bitch I'ma straight fool
No I cant lie
Dont let a day go bye where I aint high
Pump ur brake lights lemme slow it down
Know who I is n how is bout to go down
U wanna roll now
We'll just ride out 
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout

[Chorus:]
Tryna front when you see me in the club bitch you no who I am [x4]
Gettin weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet you no who I am [x4]
They be runnin up n showin all this love cause they know who I am [x4]
Didnt notice it but now ur goin nuts cause you no who I am [x4]

I be cakin'
Makin all of this money 
Look honey I aint fakin
See that ur takin
Thats cool with me
Cause you n ur boyfriend aint got shit to do with me
Truthfully
Real talk
I pimp hard she tell them to get lost
Bottles of patron good green in my cigar
See you in ur girl watchin me n my niggas
Now that ur with us 
If not wiz dont fuck a rap star
I just get it how I live
This aint the first time that you heard about wiz
So ma why I feelin me just front n act like it is
U aint the type of juice better then one poundin
Just lettin me come round now she a buss down
Feelin my convo
Then mami lets ride out
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout

[Chorus]
