
I be rollin
Riden
Flow so fly I be so so high
She say I'm that guy u wanna ride with
Like my car get inside it
U excited
I don't blame u
Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too
I don't wanna date u
I just wanna take u home n do somethin grown folks can relate too
Bitch I'm a play u
I would hate to
But if u stay cool we should be straight boo
Bitch I'm a straight fool
No I can't lie
Don't let a day go bye where I ain't high
Pump your brake lights lemme slow it down
Know who I is n how is bout to go down
U wanna roll now
We'll just ride out
Right now I'll show u what I'm bout

[Chorus:]
Tryna front when u see me in the club bitch u no who I am [x4]
Gettin weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet u no who I am [x4]
They be runnin up n showin all this love cause they know who I am [x4]
Didn't notice it but now your goin nuts cause u no who I am [x4]

I be cakin
Makin all of this money
Look honey I ain't fakin
See that your takin
That's cool with me
Cause u n your boyfriend ain't got shit to do with me
Truthfully
Real talk
I pimp hard she tell them to get lost
Bottles of patron good green in my cigar
See u in your girl watchin me n my niggas
Now that your with us
If not wiz don't fuck a rap star
I just get it how I live
This ain't the first time that u heard about wiz
So ma why I feelin me just front n act like it is
U ain't the type of juice better then one poundin
Just lettin me come round now she a buss down
Feelin my convo
Then mami let's ride out
Right now I'll show u what I'm bout

[Chorus]
