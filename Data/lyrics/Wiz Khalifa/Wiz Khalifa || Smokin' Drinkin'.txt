
That’s all the fuck I do man 
Work my motherfuckin ass off 

Smokin’, drinkin’... [x28]

I’ve been smokin’, I’ve been drinkin’ 
I don’t know what I was thinkin’ 
I’ve been high all weekend 
Drunk as fuck but still tweakin’ 
So high I can’t hear nobody 
I can’t even feel my body 
Goin’ need a paramedic prolly 
She off that cookie and the molly 
This remind me of that mafia 
Gettin’ bread, now I’m popular 
If you hatin’ keep it on the d-low 
Gotta shout out to my youngin’ p low 
In the club, man we smoking pre rolls 
Want me in your club? Need a couple zeroes 
Bandz a make us hold up plans 
Roll up all them grams 
And my new car and the new cars 
See my new chains, say I went too far 
See the watch face, say that’s too hard 
When I put gold in my 2-4 
I did it just to match my pinkie 
And probly just so these fuck niggas could see me 
While I’m 

Smokin’, drinkin’... [x28]

I’ve been smoking, I’ve been drinking 
I don’t know what I was thinking 
I been high all weekend 
Drunk as fuck but still tweaking 
Damn bro, I’m fucking fried 
Say you high as me? You a fucking liar 
We so strong it make you cough 
Teeth grinding, rolling heavy, tryna shake, you got it 
Suck the shit, it’s hella corny 
Molly got me hella horny 
Fuck it, let these bands play 
Bet these bitch so what these bad say 
Then there go your baby momma 
Looking like she want a problem 
Fuck it, I’mma give her some 
You never let her out, so I’mma make er come 
All over this damn place 
Poppin poppin like champagne 
Poppin poppin like dry bige 
You can’t connect to my Wi Fi 
I’m sky high, look at me 
Now fuck these niggas 
Let me get back to 

Smokin’, drinkin’... [x56]

That’s the one 
That fever right there
