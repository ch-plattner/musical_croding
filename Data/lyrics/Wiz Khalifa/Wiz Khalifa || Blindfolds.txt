La musica de Harry

Hippy niggas
Uh nigga my mom blow that kinda cash nigga what you talkin bout
Pop bottles and shit
Groceries fool

Uh you know I kill
Any motherfucking song that I go on
And I don't gotta count the money that I spend
'Cause I get it in
My bread so long, my bank big nigga roll on
My brain fried nigga so long
I hate fake niggas and so on
Take all the money that I made
The sharing be out the reason that you're waiting
Plus I smoke the bombest weed I call it Californication
A island for vacation I'm callin all this cake
A hundred thousand for the safe
Just baught a pound and I'm a face it
Now watch me you niggas see my pieces tryn copy
My rollie presidential plus the rings that I got on
By versace and I ain't even cocky
I'm just confident that I'm the shit
You hatin mother fuckers know what time it is

[Hook:]
I'm just ridin round my side of town
Got my windows up and my speaker loud
And we smokin so I'm gonna need a pound
Bet the haters wish they can see me now
But the money in the way
Erry one of us gettin money bruh
But money in the way
My nigga on the real, all you see is dollar bills

I blow a hundred band get the fuck around with
That holdin you in love with the hoe I mess around with
Cuff up with the Taylor, would you drink my paper
My music fuck my people but tonight I'm doing yayger
20 years on and I ain't falling off
Niggas flex about the check and they run their mouth
Ferrari pull up guess hoppin out
With a double couple in hand and some Money count
Rockin Louie this I'm rockin Louie that
Louie on my ass, Louie on my hat
When I hit the club Louie in my hand
That's the Louie 13, Louie in my glass

[Hook]
