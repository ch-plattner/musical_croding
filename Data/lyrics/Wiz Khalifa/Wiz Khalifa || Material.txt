[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success and I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz, they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh, they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh

Wait they dying to get the diamonds off my plate, the more I give the more they tryin to take, like I be serving you this evening got the nerve to wonder how I eat cuz while you sleep-in ima wake, aw man what is yull saying, money long yull's in like an on ramp, young boss man I be with a lot of goons, that know how to aim but dat chopper stay on auto-tune, I paint a perfect picture for it, so you gon need your high definition cord, they say I made it cause there ain't a thing I cant afford and car service get me to my plane before it begins to board, aye they think they hell im on a highway, cause I treat everyday like it's a Friday, my situation straight you looking sideways, on my grizzly cause my crime pays 

[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it

[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success and I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz, they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh, they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh
