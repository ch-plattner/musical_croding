[Intro - Wiz Khalifa (John Cena):]
Uhh, uhh
(Wiz, Wiz, I'ma help you re-educate the masses right now)
You know where I'm from
You know where I'm from
You know where I'm from

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Uhh, growin up in that slum
Tatted all on my chest just to let y'all know where I'm from
Uhh, haters I don't see none
Goin hard e'ry day, Lord knows I want the best for my son
So I got Chuck Taylors on my feet, and I got bent smokin my chief
And I got all my dogs with me, anyone starvin man they gon' eat
And we don't do deceit, we do real big receipts
We do first class cabin seats, if you ain't gon' stand for nothin have a seat

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa:]
Cause I'm REAL ONE, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin hard, that's all day, I'm gettin money the long way
I'm a REAL ONE, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin hard, that's all day, I'm gettin money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin all dayyyyyyy
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin all dayyyyyyy
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y

[John Cena:]
Looks like you lettin 'em know what goin all day is all about
Well, that's Mr. All Day

Y'all 'bout to find God, make you a instant preacher
They should've never let, Cena spit with Wiz Khalifa
We all day fam, hotter than a sauna
I'm not from Chi city, but I'm +Common+ on +The Corner+
W-we always hustle hard, you ballin incidental
I-I'm 'bout to go on trial, murderin instrumentals
I dumb it down for you, I keep it simple son
I need four fingers, I'm givin you the middle one

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I'm tryin to tell these boys I ain't lyin
Put it in they faces so they can get they cake like mine
But man they keep hatin and I can't see the reason why
Why when I get a plate they keep tryin to take it
Put 'em in they places

[Chorus]
