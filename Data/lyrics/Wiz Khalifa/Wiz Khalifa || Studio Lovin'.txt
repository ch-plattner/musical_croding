
Girl let me take you to my studio 
Give you everything you want and need 
Lay you flat like a piano 
If you let me stroke your keys 
You going be saying things you never said 
Matter fact you going be playing melodies you never played 
We aint' in no bed, 
We in the lab 
And I'm reclining in my seat 
You can just climb on top of me and ride me like this beat 
You say you need this (loving) 
Well imma grab your wasteline, 
And if you like it deep, 
I could hit you with that baseline 
I aint' tryin to waste time 
For me and your sake 
Plus I'm payin for this session 
I need more than one take 
I make the boards shake like how I'm suppose to 
I'll have you sounding good 
Lil ma, I got them pro tunes 
Now you in the mood 
I got you doing this and tryin that 
Beating in your drum 
While I'm playing with your high hat 
You like that 
Soo you dont want to, I just make you do it 
Got you in love, cuz when we fuck its like we making music, go n' lose it 

[Chorus]
I don't want to be unusual 
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. 
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa. 
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though, 
And even thought there's probably other places we can go, 
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa 

And no, it aint gonn stop 
I keep this song on replay 
Puttin all them scratches on my back 
I'm like go dj 
Be my guitar 
I'll pluck your g-string 
Pull it to the side 
Imma make them vocals drop 
I'm gripin on your thighs 
We tangled like some cables 
From the front look in your eyes 
Then I turn you like some pables 
No you fiendin for this (loving) 
That's what you gonn get 
And I cant sing,but I see you 
And know I'm gonn hit,yeaa 
Lets do the verses now 
Worry about the beat later 
Heard you be going off that head 
You dont need paper 
Play you an e-major, a-minor 
Girl your rythym straight 
And I say you got great timing 
Feel your heart rate climbing 
Like when my speakers quake 
More than a qruayer straight 
You got that 8-o-a 
You say you cant 
But I do something that just make you do it 
Me and you dont fuck 
We make music, yeaa 

[Chorus]
I don't want to be unusual 
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. 
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa. 
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though, 
And even thought there's probably other places we can go, 
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa
