I tell 'em mind they fuckin' buisness
I'm tryna' find a couple Swishers
I think I bought a box and don't remember
They watchin' this boy
You see that smoke comin' out my windows?
I keeps Urkle like the Winslows
You smell purple when the wind blows
Don't know how I wake up sober
I got to sleep
Can't even keep my eyes open
'Member first time I tried smoking, Wiz
Damn near thought I'z gone die chokin'
Smoke Kush, so that's probably why I look
Eye's gettin' red, mouth all dry
My memory, yo

[Interlude]

Took a trip out to Cali
And man I've never been
Before or even after dat
Me and my niggas roll 'em back to back
Until we get
Yeahh
On the road roll thirty blunts before a show
They like how do you perform
I say this is what I duz
You could say yeah, I love mah drugs
Matter uh fact roll another one
Calm mah buzz

I get er'body in this bitch
Brought the Chronic
Er'body get a spliff
Don't smoke, get a tiny little whiff
And be feelin'
Smoking in my car
Don't even know to drive my whip
Roll another one when the first blunt's lit
My energy, yo
It's fadin away
Yeahh
You know, keep that cloud a smoke
Man, stay rollin' up them Swishers
Pullin' out dat bag
Yeahh
