First thing uh huh, wake up out a dream uh huh
Grab a lighter uh huh, something I can steam uh huh
Bong rip uh huh, make sure it's clean uh huh
Smoke sesh uh huh, nigga what you mean uh huh
In my car uh huh, cruising down the street uh huh
So stoned I'mm need something to eat uh huh
No tray uh huh, ashes on my seat uh huh
High it up uh huh, Taylors on my feet uh huh
Cloud 9 uh huh, going through my mind uh huh
Take a toke uh huh, hold it 'til you choke huh uh
Moving forward uh huh, cruising on my board uh huh
Still got more uh huh, burn it to a short uh huh

[Pre-Hook:]
(And I be floating)
And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(Higher than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating)
And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(High than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be higher than a motherfucker)

[Hook:]
High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling

Tell that nigga use a grinder for that weed uh huh
And tell him "roll another joint don't fall asleep" uh huh
Smoke peace uh huh, pipe like a chief uh huh
Heard you got a cheaper price for that reefer huh
What you need? Uh huh, never find a seed uh huh
Take a dab uh huh, straight THC uh huh
For the highest in the room look at me uh huh
Somewhere in the clouds that's where we wanna be uh huh
Got you shook uh uh, not just for the look uh huh
Half the day uh huh, rolled the whole book uh huh
Drive slow uh huh, blowin by the O uh huh
Eyes low uh huh, everybody know it damn

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

Growing up uh huh, never gave a fuck uh huh
Pulling out the 62 and showing up uh huh
Twenty-six, guess that mean I'm growing up uh huh
Pouring up uh huh, all my niggas rolling up
Making sure that...
