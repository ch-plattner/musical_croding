I'm reppin' Taylor Gang too man shout out to anybody else reppin Taylor Gang
You already know how we do, it's your boy young Khalifa
Flyer than ever,
Rep Taylor Gang, we're the higher the better
My lines are clever and all my bitches dimes or better
About my cheese mozzarella
Chains like the old Roc-a-fella
I know your girls a freak, but you'll never be acapella
I got it locked the hell up, sewn
And I ain't need no help I did it on my own
I outta be a pilot, all the places I have flown
If they made another me it'll be a million dollar clone
Haters goin' hate
The bitches say I moan
My money like my hair now, it's gettin kind of long
Comin' up people swore they seen us
Now I'm rich, need a chick as bad as Kanye's Phoenix
So roll up please, In flex we trust
Let them lames be lames we goin' just be us
So roll up please, In flex we trust
Let them lames be lames we goin' just be us
That's it man, you know, a little Taylor gang paper planes
Put them 2 fingers up man, if you with it
And If you ain't get with it man, you'll get flown over
