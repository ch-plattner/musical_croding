Alotta ya'll thinkin it's your time but I'll tell you it's taylor gang season
Gotta man so they tryin talk bad but I don't care cause mother fucker I'm eatin
And my city got faith in me cause I give em sum1 to believe in
Tell me I'm a HEERRROOO a young mother fuckin HEEERRROOO

The best when I'm flowin get goin no way I can stop
Superhuman strength but don't show it so call me hancock
Benny off of sandlot I pick on the beast
Represent my citys streets when I shit all over beats
Young p park how I stick to a track man
The way I make hits you should call me the batman
I'm more like a jetson cause nigga I'm spacely
I'm eatin like pac man you playin like jacks and
A roll model but gotta keep me some weeds
We're all ridin with a superhero dime I call her g girl
Know I'm a star and my car is parked outta the world
And my diamonds kinda remind my mama of sea world
Homie you niggas got zero
They say they need someone to come and change the game well I'm a mother fuckin
HEEERRROOOO
A young mother fuckin
HEEEERRROOOO
No cape I'm tatted up to my face
I know more than half of you niggas fake
Like a mystery men rolll a swisher sweet then
I gets I'll t milly tell em I'm bad news
I straight runnin shit punishin', Frank Castle
I'm like tony without the iron suit
I put that mother fucker on ain't no tellin where I'm goin
My pedal to the floor you'll never be in my lane
Can't remember my name they notice me from my chain let's go
I'm young wizzle I'm a get this thing poppin
This year my cd gon be the sickest thing droppin
Makin money off a rap you niggas need options
The way I get that green they say I be green goblin
I became bossman ya'll remain lame now I'm somewhere get in tan smokin swisher sweets coughin
Fresh like a body yea a body in a coffin
Might as well take you back to 97 I'm the bomb like blouw

Alotta ya'll thinkin it's your time but I'll tell you it's taylor gang season
Gotta man so they tryin talk bad but I don't care cause mother fucker I'm eatin
And my city got faith in me cause I give em sum1 to believe in
Tell me I'm a HEERRROOO a young mother fuckin HEEERRROOO GIIIIRRRLLLLLL.
