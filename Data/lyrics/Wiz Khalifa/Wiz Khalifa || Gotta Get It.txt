As you'll see fans turned over a new leaf
I know it's hard to swallow that's how the truth be
Heard I'm gettin' dollars got you lookin' for the new me
A lot of niggas on they own shit I do me
I'm one hundred everything I talk you'll see
And I'mma chase that bread 'til I'm filthy
I keep money on the wig like ya girl's weave
And I kill beats - that's probly why they think hip hop's dead cause I spit hot lead
Feel like I just got fed, so I'm nowhere near comfortable
Even though they tell me can't no one here fuck with you
Bitches scream my name, real niggas say "I fucks with you"
I grind no days off that's how a hustler do
And I'm accustomed to creatin' that real shit
That money motivate you can feel shit

That paper on my mind I'mma grind 'til I'm finished
I'm feelin' like I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
And realistically the sky is the limit
I'm out here so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Niggas slackin' on they grind intuition
They slippin' so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Yeah yeah and change the life I'm livin'
That's out here for me - so I, I gotta get it. (Yeah)
