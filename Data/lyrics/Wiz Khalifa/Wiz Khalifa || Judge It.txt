[Wiz Khalifa:]
Pushin' your buttons, you ain't sayin' nothin'
That's an understatement
Grabbin' my keys and walkin' out, you takin' me places
Hidin' my weed
I text you before I leave that I'll be back but you ain't hearin' that
All you've been hearin' is my car steerin'
Smokin' weed all night with my friends
Hangin' out, you waitin' up for me to come in to the door
And it ain't like you don't want this anymore
But it's some shit that need worked on
Like each and every night I need to work
Tell me I need to slow shit down to make some time for her
That's when the drama start
You sayin' shit like you ain't got a heart
I'm walkin' around like I ain't got a problem

[Hook - Ty Dolla $ign:]
[?] fuckin'
I ain't gonna judge ya
Lets just fuck all night and talk about it in the mornin'
Let's talk about it in the mornin'
Let's talk about it in the mornin'
In the mornin', in the mornin', in the mornin'

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Always at home claimin' you spend too much time alone
Them other niggas did you wrong and now I'm the one
Yeah right, look at what they did, now look at what I did
Not to mention I was the most faithful nigga in existence
But when it goes down that's how they flip shit
I'm too high, too lifted
Too fly, too gifted
I need a break from LA, go back to my home state
Let you play the victim, I'll be straight
Hit the lab get, back to my cake
See my son, kiss him on his face
When in the public watch what you say, kay?

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa:]
We don't gotta talk about it now
Just let me take you down
In the mornin' when we yawnin' I'mma get one more in
I know I got you high, you ain't even hit the weed and I got you high
I know I got you high, Young Khalifa man and the Dolla $ign

[Hook]
