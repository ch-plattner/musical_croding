[Chorus (x2):]
Don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.
Don't, don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.
Don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.
If you ain't sup than you can fucked get your ass out.

[Verse]
That's digital situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby
But I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused
With one of them other dudes.
I ain't none of them.
Under they breath mumbling.
Scared to tell them hoes what it is.
You put yourself in that position.
I chill with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark.
Cold heart, tear your feelings apart
I'm more focused on getting my rims powder coated
One of the dopest, I'm scheduled one
You just ibuprofen, what is you smoking?
I'm focused to growing they got you choking
The options open, you can hide with them suckers
Or ride low and get higher than a motherfucker!

[Chorus]

Straight stunting, sucker niggas I take from them.
They bitches that is, get up in the car with wiz
They know they going to bank something, ain't fronting.
Smoking off the eighth onion
Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen
Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything in the fly we trust.
This bottle smell is obvious
Than my connect come from cali
I'm good long as the money piling up
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping
Big Jane twisting
Walking how I talk it bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping.

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Yo I was candy coated, Bentley colored
Fifth? Fifth? Really made a
Killing with the bumper grill
Chandelier ceiling plush leaning
Is you fucking, is you sucking
I was wondering cause if not
Don't be pushing all my buttons in my cutless
Unless you cutting. Bitch I'm just saying
I ain't tricking is the reason that this porno flick playing
Troy shaking knocking pictures off the wall
Southern made call, 808 mean no draws
You got friends I fuck them all
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane.
Mississippi Pimp mouth piece frigid
Dolemite out of sight
Show you bright can you feel it shawty

[Chorus]
