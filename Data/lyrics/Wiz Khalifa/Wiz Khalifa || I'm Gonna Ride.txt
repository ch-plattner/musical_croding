
Sick a nigga run over switches states macking broads getting cake glocking mad glocking blast
Thought with the bitch nigga a quick escape I move with dudes that be dishing weight smooth with
The uz that will hit your face came in the game and I'm changing the game with a flow that will
Run around the crews the hate this guy is a pimp and you know his fan I don't hold the grams
I'm a colder man and I do it for the youngers and the older fans niggas whippin in the kitchen
Tryin to hold there grams I don't play around lay em down for the lil homie wanna play the clown
I'm casing pounds spraying rounds follow the khalifa cause it's going down money in the rubber band
Slang crack rock try and find the man in the flat top ask anyone in the streets everyone around
Knows where he beast and I'm killing the beef you can chill in the team but a steel of at least
I'm up in your brain you better be taking the lord you better be keeping your chain see this guy
Here is a nousense you talk fire and you can't proof it you just lie up in your music send my guys
To come and shoot shit duke I ride and this is true as you would die if niggas pulling I don't
Know what you fucking see when you know as well you've been fucking me.

[Chorus x2:]
I'm on the move so if you get in my way I'm a ride ride till I die and it should be no suprise
We paper chasing man, messing with my cake or fam imm ride ride till they die fuck us try
I'm gonna ride for me ride for me die for me die for me
What's your 45 for me face the judge and lie for me
Ride for me ride for me die for me die for me
What's your 45 for me face the judge and lie for me

P. I. T. T. S. B. U. R. G. H. represent to the fullest and I'm putting cowards back into place
When I'm rapping the taste, yeah crack in the place, laugh in your face, lay up and chill after
You safe that's a mistake cause I'm moving with a gang of I'll guys looking like the last of
The day but why you say cause my nigga I could die today lock down and never see the light
Of day kidnapped trapped in a hide away so I never get the cat to ride away fire inside of
May the kid move with da fools that try to take the game back to the rhyming days payback
For the fact that your guys a fake and I can't even believe you can spit shit to the people
Like it. chips and just leaves you with kids that leaves you see through you pricks
Hand my shit an overdose so you wrote and sold some coke move some crack how true is that
Front on my cats and you'll lose shit back haters get back when I'm through with rap
And I'm feeling my tracks with truth and fact kill em on wax and I'm moving cats
When they crew in all black yeah I'm doing that I gotta flavor that will flow and taste
And I'm doing it till I'm blue in the face I'm thinking bigger then any nigga that think
He cool in the place which gives me reason to but a tool to his waist.

[Chorus]
