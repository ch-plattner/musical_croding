Yeahhh!
That's exactly what I tell these hoes,
(?) type a brotha,
Fly head to toe. (WOO!)
I gotta lot of swag,
Need a professional.
And get this doggy bag,
Just I'm head to go.

Yeah I rappin,
All the hoes wanna sing to me.
Do a couple things to me.
Make her bring the team to me. (Team to me.)
I don't wanna fuck. (Nope!)
It might seem rude. (It might.)
A little attitude, 
Probably gotta mean chew (Wow!)
You a bad bitch,
With a couple bad friends.
I could let you rock the mic,
She could do the ad libs. (Do the ad libs)
They say I'm aggin,
Nah home, I'm gettin paid. (Get money!)
Shine while I'm young,
Balls in the shade. (Shade.)
So ya best, best hop your ass in the ling. (Ling.)
Fix your doobie up, (Up!)
And start to chew me up. (Up!)
You wanna screw me, what? (What?)
Fuck your old man. (Man.)
Gettin top notch, with no hangers. (Nah!)

And that's exactly what I tell the bitch, (Beetch!)
Ain't got the time to easy your mind,
I'm on some other shit. (Sheett!)

A young star, baby!
Ever met a nigga like me? (Nope!)
Not at all, baby. (Yeahhh!)

And live today,
Cause I ain't worried about tomorrow, baby. (Nah!)
You heard my song, (Like my songs?)
You seen my face around, (Round.)
So now it's you and me,
So take this good weed and break it down. (Break it down.)
Spot boppers,

And given brains,
Let me know just what she thinkin bout. (Wow!)
Burning trees,
Courtesy of my Jamaican pal. (Pal.)
Gettin all this money,
With all these honeys I could make em pout. (Make em pout.)
Now I could make you smile, (Smile.)
Or I can make you moan. (Moan.)
Turn you into my number one fan if I take you home. (Take you home. )
Want me to break you off? (Break ya off?)
