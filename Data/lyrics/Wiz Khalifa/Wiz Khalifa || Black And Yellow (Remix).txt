[Wiz Khalifa]
Yea uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [x4]
Yea uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [x4]

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin
I rep my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [x4]

[Young Jeezy]
Brown blunts, black Nike's
3 red bone bitches and they all dykes
Said her girl on the way, she a yellow bone
Said she wanna hear me on the black and yellow song
Told her guess what? this your lucky day
Smoked an ounce with Young Wiz just the other day
Young on the G Mix, should we change the colors
Tell 'em hell to the No you pussy muthafuckas
Remember cop my 1st lamb it was Black and Yellow
You know it had to match the watch so it matched the bezel
Bitch I just seen Young in a bananna peel
Got that 50 round clip for that bannana feel
They tellin' lies for a living, I so Roddy White
Pull the plug on them niggas it was nighty night
Outta sight outta mind, bitch Im in these streets
Next summer, helicopter, black and yellow seats

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin
I rep my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [x4]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And women love me cause I'm messin' with their best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
This aint for one night I'm shinin all week bro
I'm sippin cleeko and rockin yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up cause every body that I'm with taylor'd

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin
I rep my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [x4]

Stay fly like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds, cant get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna ride with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high, she want she feel that, convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin
I rep my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow [x4]
