(Niggas gonna need a nap in a little bit)
Burn slow (Get back up from a trap nap)
Burn slow, burn slow
(I'm burning slow right now)
Burn slow
(I'm at the end of the inscent)
Burn slow, burn slow
(Niggas ain't got kids)
Burn slow, burn slow

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Nobody open the door
Homie I blow by the “O”
Burning it down, good shit is all that I know
I done had all that before
Shawty a pro, told her get down on the floor
She take it all in her throat
She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes
Fuck her, don't need her no more
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone
Break her like six in them stones
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow
I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk who they are, but they don't do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk, I'm on that water in a cup
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke
I'mma go get me an "O" and

[Swae Lee:]
Burn slow, burn slow [x4]

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Got a couple thousand dollars and some change rolled up
I get money every day so everything's on us
I got my own strain, it come with my name
Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same
A different lane, we sipping champagne
I been in the game, just give me a flame
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
I hunt her today, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know
I go to her page, she come to my place
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane
She look at my change, she start giving brain
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same

[Swae Lee:]
Burn slow, burn slow [x4]
