[Hook:]
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day

Wake up in the morning, time to smoke a joint
Talkin', talkin', to me - better get straight to the point
I talk a lot of shit cause no top is on my whip
I'm mobbin' with my chick and we coppin' all the shit
I'm rubbin' with my chick, paparazzi on my dick
Everytime I come around, they wanna take a pic
Got so many cars, I don't know which one to drive
Grab a flight to Vegas and the pilot let me fly

[Hook]

[Uzi:]
When I wake up in the morning then I gotta get stoned
And when I'm on the internet all I see is clones
I get cameras on me like my name is Mike Jones
Cameras with me and cameras flying on drones
You know I'm talkin' money if I'm talkin' on the phone
If it's not about the money, will you please leave me alone?
Another [?] freak in Hollywood
She’s a Twitter freak, all she do is twerk and tweet
Everything changed, everything got strange
I've been making plays so the money's going crazy
As fuckin' [?] I don't wanna boy, I'm hoppin' out that lane
Always got my swagger, I’m Uzi McConaughey

[Hook]

Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Two cellphones hooked up when I'm tryna make a play
Everything's changing so fast
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day
Everything got different so fast
See ya'll on the tour, stay under the influence
Taylor!
Get money all day, get money all day, get money all day
