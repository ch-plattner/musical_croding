Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us

Most of us, ride around with pistols, we don't give a fuck
Most of us, down to rep that gang and we gon' throw it up
Most of us, brought our own dope and we down to smoke
Most of us, need a bad bitch with some good throat
Most of us, came from nothin', we get somethin', we gon' ball
Most of us, got that work for sale, we just need a call
Most of us, 'bout that change, pop his brain, no remains
Most of us, feel no pain, homie, it's a dirty game
Most of us, never seen this comin' so we feelin' blessed
Most of us, got alotta shit to get up off our chest
Most of us, still up in the field right where niggas get killed
Most of us, know that shit can get real in that city of steel

Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us

Most of us
Most of us
Most of us
Most of us

Most of us, made our own way without a hand out
Most of us, smoke that loud kush so we stand out
Most of us, rather get the top instead of fuckin' that bitch
Most of us, rather pass her off instead of lovin' the bitch
Most of us, spend thousands on clothes, still don't care how we dress
Most of us, seen her top, but still know what the bottom is
Most of us, keep your main bitch in our phone
Most of us, keep Khalifa kush in the bong
Started off with nothin' now my niggas is on
If we got a problem, we don't put it in song
Most of us, got our change up, never change up
Most of us, Taylor Gang on, you a stranger

Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
