I live life like the weekend (weekend) 
Get it in every night til the weekend (weekend) 
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah) 
Hard work got my bank account peakin (peakin) 
Shit straight, you can trust me 
Niggas gon hate, but the hoes just love me (love me) 
Don't it sound so good 
How a youngin so fresh with a style so hood 

Got visions of your man, broke and doin bad 
Fans stand in line just to take pictures of your man 
Flow hot, should be in the kitchen with the pans 
Money be on the floor stacked to the ceiling with the fan 
I'm living what I'm saying 
Name known everywhere I go, west coast to the buildings in Japan 
Trying to keep them dollar signs fillin up my pants 
So I don't need weight , the boy got cake 
See me in every city, different broad in every state 
Niggas all got new intentions cause Im winning in the race 
I make a broad turn groupie 
She like, "gosh, look at all this Gucci
I have her in the crib late night, in the crib rollin that stink up 
Now she talkin bout getting inked up 
I don't see yall weak fucks 
Now that yall swole me and Niko linked up 
Now we gon eat up

Wizzle listen, this is where them and us both differ 
Before they had the voice now they have the pitcher 
And we will deliver 
We are the stars, the big dippers, get it? 
High sky scraping, the constellations 

High sky scrapin', the constellations 
My flow forsaken and they cannot take it 
And I'm gon give it and they will not make it 
my flow coke an I'm gon bake it 
But I never sold it 
More like a weed tota, mota rolla Nextel chirpa 
Your girl is a slurpa, but you don' know it 
Young Wiz told me, he put his hommie on it 
And I ran up on it, and we had a moment or two 
You ain't seen me since how lonely are you? 
You sad and you're weepin' 'I'm comin' right back, 
Imma see you next weekend
