No, nooo, noo, no, no, nooo
Ooohh, noo, no

Once we smoke, we gotta use them incense, babe
Do my stroke, for real
I'mma do it slow, like a puff-puff pass
Right...

And when we smoke
Oh, we gotta use them incense babe
When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it
So long, we be burning out them candles girl
Oh, no, no, nooo

When I'm out with my niggas, when you're out with your bitches
...You don't text or call!
You the late night type, you would spend a little, too

Ride with me, spend time with me
Unwind with me, so I could read
And be on top of me
In front of me
Having fun with me
Girl, for none of me

And when we smoke, we gotta use some incense, babe
And when I stroke, you gonna remember my name when I'm in it
Go longer than them candles burn

You want it all? You get it all
Where my down-South girls? Where my Eastcoast girls?
Where my Westcoast girls? Where my Chi-town girls?
My Toronto girl
Oh, I know you with it
Out of France, they say that I'm the man

And when we smoke, we gotta use them incense babe
When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it
So long, we be burning out them candles girl
Oh, no, no, nooo

When we smoke, we gotta use them incense, baby
When I stroke, you gone remember my name
I'ma go low, do it til them candles burn
Uhh, ooohh, uhhh
