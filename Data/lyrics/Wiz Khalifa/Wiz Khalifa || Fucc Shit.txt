I always had hard beats to rap to 
Always had strong, always had that sack too 
I was just a young nigga getting tattoos 
Now they say I’m on, yea they say I’m that dude 
Great A, I’m smoking on a roll 
All my clothes smell like chronic smoke 
Shades on cause I’m fucking faded 
Buyin all the bottles, show the club we made it 

Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 

I can see through all the bullshit 
I’m lie to join and make you do a full spin 
I’mma fly first class with my niggas I’m cool with 
I’mma hit the club with 50 grand and lose it 
Faded off gin, let’s call for alcohol 
I brought it all, I done go spend 
My homies got all of em in 
And niggas be mad at us cuz they ain’t ballin 
They money ain’t tall as us 
But I never worry bout niggas that talk that shit but keep follow up 

Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit

Now look, I rep the shit that I was raised on 
Shitting them dollar signs, what is based on 
And our road defines and how couldn’t we? 
Spend the long time in that hooptye 
But I get it in, smoke a lot of trees, drink a lot of gin 
Nigga like me got a couple friends and a couple bottles and a couple bands but I’m all in 
Came in the game balling 
My old school, what is yall in? 
And I’m cashing on and you’re stalling 
End of the night, your bitch I’m calling 
But fuck a nigga, wanna roll with me? 
Let it fight up, let it smoke with me 
This young fuck the lanes but he love the chin 
She love to wait then I sling it deep 
And I’m in the club and I fuck the haze 
Don’t need them niggas tryina bother me 
But I puff and powder for the time to be 
Standing on the couch, call it luxury 
Lil model chicks wanna fuck with me 
Wanna smoke with me, wanna drink with me 
Wanna come with me but I’m in and out 
Like I’m supposed to be, still smoking trees 

Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... 
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit 
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know...
