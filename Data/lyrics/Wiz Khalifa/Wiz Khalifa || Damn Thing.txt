See we ain't worried 'bout damn thing, damn thing
You talking it but you not about a damn thing
So what 'chu doing about it? not a damn thing (damn thing)
Keep it moving, I'm overdoing my damn thing (damn thing)

You see I'm here now. that's right you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't liftwaiting, I'm taking lots of grands
Cuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt
Ain't got 'cha gun you better find you one (why?)
Cuz this is Pistolvania. where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8ball
And you never really see one of my niggas until they cake long
Aye what 'chu mean man? something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Prolly mad because of the shit that I have
I never let them slow me down dawg I'm living fast
So as long as the chick want to get with the young
And it's all about making this cash
I'm still a young'n but niggas respect the flow
And don't check me, ya better check ya ho

[Hook]

I'm in the studio, making classic keep
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for the ones
And I'm bout done with you punks
And you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know
I put the bussiness on a nigga, really feeling nutty when he come
And try to touch the flow
Cause I'm not for the game, opt you will not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk & you talk if you sane
And its 4-1-2 till I fall to the grave
They'on know what to do with the ball to this game
Cause I'm always pimpin' if you hear my voice it attract the whole world gone listen
Some niggas might can hate, but you can say
I get away with murder like o j simpson
I'm into all day grinding, don't knock or come near
See I'm putting the time in. the young'n keep rhyming
So one day I can sit back & reclining
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun
Call me the best out, khalifa get it done! (yes!)
