I hear it all the time
About it all
Why they talk?
Don't even know what they want
Don't even know what they want
Don't even know what they want
All that cake
Don't even know what they want
Don't even know what they want
Don't even know what they want

Uh

New bitch
Every week
She take it off
Bonin!
Hair long, tatted on her back
I get her a first class flight to where my show is
Smoke weed, don't smoke weak
Catch contact, get drunk
Let me hit once, bitch come back
Ballin, can't ever control it
Don't have to text, don't even call it
My name is on it
I fuck her good and make that Uber call 6 in the morning
I told her I don't need no pills, these Js I'm rolling
Feeling my car, feeling my chain
Ass looking soft, I'm feeling that thing
Ride with a nigga & I'll put you up all in some game
Why would you fuck with another nigga that’s something you should say
Came at the same time on the both ways
We ain't even hardly know each other names
By now I'm on my 6th ring or some
By now I'm on my 200,010th plane or some
By now you could say I'm living like Rick James or some
Insane, cause it spit flames when I switch lanes I'm stuntin
Big bank, no lose change, I do things
Champagne me, L.A. me
Supper Club throwin’ dough, no ray me
Fifty deep in VIP, T.G.O.D
Your bitch remind me of this ink, she all on me
I'm gone, I'm rocking KK cologne
I think these bitches tryna fuck me so I'm takin' them home
Take what I do inside the day & put it straight in the song
I get another 'bouta pound & put it straight in the bong
Imma stay real, Imma stay high
Imma stay ready, Imma stay [?]
Count til my thumbs hurt, smoke til my lungs hurt
What another man say, I know my own work
Handle business
With my real niggas, like a real nigga
And it's real business
All business, no hard feelings
All my dogs, got they all in it
Hard to get along with us
Call a kush Jean-Claude, god damn it kick strong
Rollie on my arm, fake niggas y'all really don't appear to a real nigga
