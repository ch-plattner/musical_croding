
I'm so incredible wait
Wit no metal to waist
I flow great
And that'll level ya face
But I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but u still a faggot
I front on cowards cause u niggas backwards
I got my money right
Game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from tha city
Of the triflin' hoods
But when u see me
Gotta smile on my face
Nuttin sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood
Slums came up out that
Rap game about that
To gain pay wit out crack
See I'mma youngin wit too much on my plate
To let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sells
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, they worries ain't jail
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf
So I'm here
For sum reason though they hate it to death
The love's gone only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking
This is history in the making

Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps
And out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like the time watch
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there
I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life
Son reached
Deceased
No time to blink or think twice damn
Wonder when it gonna be my time
To meet death
I'm stressed need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine
U see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now
Ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young
Ya time's up I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking,
This is history in the making
