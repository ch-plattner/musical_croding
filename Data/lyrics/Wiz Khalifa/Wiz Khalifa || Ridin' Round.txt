Pulled up on some niggas stuntin 
I had to hop out, show em’ I was really ’bout that money 
Heard he was, he was talkin, he ain’t really want it 
I’m from a place, you want a problem niggas? Get it jumpin 
I mix some chronic up with hash up up in a joint I’m stuffin 
Am jumpin my car, jumpin my car, to the floor I’m gunnin 
And I’ll be shitting since before I could afford the pluming 
You niggas keep on talking classics, I got more that’s coming 
Order something uh 

Yea I rode em all neighborhood 
In all of Memphis 
Evergreen 
Hollywood 
Walkers in brown 
You know what, let’s get it 

Pushing through my city like I’m getting heavy on that dough 
With a white girl with me in a 2 seater, white girl full of coke 
Straight from Memphis 10, ain’t no hater gon stop me 
Juicy J, been paid, got a Phantom in my pockets 

I’m high as fuck, can’t even see 
Nigga fuck your baby momma, that bitch with me 
Say I’m gonna get her high, she gon fuck for free 
Makes you look much better when you on your knees 
Put her on the cabbage, I don’t do the baggage 
Smoking all this green, rocking all these karats 
Ridin round, getting high and a bad habit 
Make weed disappear, then you believe in magic 

Ridin round ya hollaback 
No words man 
Try get some pussy tonight 
Dig? 
Now the niggas still call my phone man 
It’s gon always be about cash 
Good talk uhm 
Yep 
Ain’t chasin no hoe man 
Real talk 
I’m on that paper chase 
Ans when you niggas can do that shit you won’t 
But uh I got too much tied up 
So, on that note 
Ain’t gon never stop making money 
I know a lot of niggas be like damn 
Nigga still at it 
Told you niggas 
Never 
There will always be cash 
And always drugs 
Strip clubs that’ll never close 
So yall nigga know what it is
