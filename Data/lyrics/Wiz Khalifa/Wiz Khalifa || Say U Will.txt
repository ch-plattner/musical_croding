Okaay
And they say don't say it less you mean it
Back when I was young I say I will be the one
People say they couldn't see it
But on the other hand
There was some sayin I be this
Nigga on top as soon as you say I'm defeated
T-Pain, they sayin I couldn't believe it
Funny cause they say the same thing when they see me
The way I spit you would say I was bulimic
And this beat so hard
I had to say I did a remix
Niggas hate they don't say it but they think it
When you lame I can't hear what you sayin when you speakin
Another plane my mother sayin get some sleep in
I can't I'm livin what others sayin they dream is
Now the hoes sayin I'm conceited
Cause they wanna give me brains
And I say I don't need it
I'm gettin paid and payin so much attention
To what these radios playin and sayin to me ends
I ain't sayin I'm that deep in
But I'm sayin I got my feet in
In a year they gon say I'm Michael Phelps
And you gon think to yourself
Before you jump into the deep end
It was said that my city was sleepin
Outta state I had to say what that P meant
"I put on" like Kan said on that Jeezy
Come to where I live the kids say I'm like He-Man
Doin everything that you say I can't
Not a stroke of luck player
You can say I plan
Tired of sayin shit to make these niggas understand
So I'll be everything that you say I am
Very strange, yes
You niggas too plain, I'm a Taylor Gang Jet
And my lames left
I talk money so I save breath
And niggas say that I'm lucky
I say that I'm blessed

[break]

Hundreds on the mattress
Twenties on the floor
Kids with dirty handguns posted by the door
When I was 14 they used to send me to the store
To bring back blunts, now I'm the one that's rollin up
Speakers bump, iPhone plug-in for my truck
E-Knievel, showin ya niggas how to stunt
I mess up flows like waves and potholes
West Coast I fuck hoes and eat Roscoes
Got gold with diamonds in it
All the finest linen
Versace, my city tryin lock me hahaha
{That's my Biggie flow right there, I dunno if ya'll caught that.
That's that Biggie flow though}
