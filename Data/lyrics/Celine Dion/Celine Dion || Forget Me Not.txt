Forget me not
Baby baby
As I rock you gently
Right here in my arms
I promise to always
Be here for you
Keep you safe and warm

Sometimes in the middle of the night
I wake up cryin when I think of how long
It took to find you
And now that I have I won't be movin' on
Nothing can ever separate us
We know where we belong

All I'm asking you
All I'm asking
Before this moments gone

Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
You'll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

Time is funny
Time can fly
That's one thing for sure
I'll wake tomorrow
Blink my eyes
See you standin' at that door

And I'll be lookin at you
See the wonder of what love can be
Someday I might have to let you go
And that's just so hard to believe
And if I do you'll know just
How much you mean to me
And all I'll ask of you
All I'll ask you
Before I set you free

Forget me not
Don't forget what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For all my life
You'll be my light
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

Forget me not
forget me not
forget me

Don't forget me baby
forget me
not
before I set you free yeah

Forget me not
Forget me
Don't forget what we got
what we got
Every day is surely but a dream
I found the sweetest of all things
For ever more
connection
I'll thee adore
With every beat that's in your heart
that's in my heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

Don't forget what we got
With every beat that's in your heart
Oh baby please remember to
Forget me not

Not
Forget me not
