
Forgive me for the things
That I never said to you
Forgive me for not knowing
The right words to say, to prove

That I will always be
Devoted to you and me
And if you can't feel that in my love
Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way it made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
'Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Well, maybe there've been times
That I let you down
Looking back on all those moments
I know that I should have found

Love is to be for you
And now I will promise to you
And if you don't see that in my eyes
Then I'll be
Sorry for the rest of my life

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way it made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

But I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Aren't we all make mistakes
No matter how hard we try
But hearts can't only break
When sorry comes all around

OOh, when sorry comes around

I'm not sorry...
For my love
For my touch

I would do it all again
I wouldn't take back my love

Because with you I've lived
A thousand lives into one
But I could never be
I could never be
I could never be
I could never be

Sorry for love
