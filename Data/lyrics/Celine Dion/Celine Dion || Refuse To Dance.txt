Got your invitation to the dance
Wear your party dress
Maybe I was just an innocent
But I confess
I never even knew the song
The orchestra was playing

See the cuties in their party clothes
Oh it's getting warm
Off the shoulder cut into the hip
Like a uniform
Did you think I'd want to tow the line
Well now the line is broken

[Chorus]
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance
Refuse to dance

You said you're such a pretty thing
You could make a mark
I'll teach you all the steps you'll need
Guide you through the dark
Suddenly I tought I knew the song
The orchestra was playing

[Repeat Chorus]

See how they follow
You say jump. They jump
You say turn. They turn
Look back in sorrow
I won't be there

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
