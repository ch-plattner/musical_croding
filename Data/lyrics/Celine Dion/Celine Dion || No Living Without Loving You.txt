
If you ever leave me
Life will go on
Stars will still be
Bright as diamonds in the sky now
Even if you said goodbye now
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
That sun would keep shinning down
If you weren't here with me
This world would still be spinnin' 'round
But baby there would be

Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive without you

If you ever walk out this door
What would I have left to live for
What would there be left to do now
What would I be without you now
Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
Each day would go on just the same
There would still be air to breath
It wouldn't stop the sun and rain
But baby there would be

Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive without you

That sun would still keep shinning down
If you weren't here with me
That world would still be spinnin' 'round
But you know I would have nothing
Won't have no life if I don't have your loving
If I don't have you with me

Just no living without loving you
How could I ever survive
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive without you
