
If your shoes refuse to shine
And your legs don't walk in line
And tomorrow it's just another time, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman walking on you

And if your feet can't find the floor
And your key won't fit the door
And you forgot just that two twos are four, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman walking on you

Oh yeah, now
And I've seen you wandering, baby
Up and down my street, yeah
Trying to explain that 
I caused all this pain
To all the people that you meet
Searching for that imperious,

mysterious femme fatal kind of stuff, yeah
But if you don't know by now
That it's me anyhow
Then baby, you've got it wrong

So if your play gets so confused
and you TV is blowing the fuse
just come on over you've got nothing to lose

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman walking on you
walking on you
walking on you
walking on you

'Cause I need, I need a man to love
Because I need a man to love...
