White chocolate kisses under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you really want to get the root of me
You don't have to try so hard
Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you wanna know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

I cry for no reason
I laugh at awkward moments
There's no manual that explains where I'm going
So show me the way, show me the way

White chocolate kisses under the stars
Riding on horses
Boys with guitars
If you really want to know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

You played that thing like you're talking again
You strum those strings like an angel of love
Did you notice I can't focus on nothing else?
What's making me come out of my shell?
Sometimes it's so hard to tell
I don't even know myself when you do, yeah, you do

Oh baby

Don't ask for directions 
I'm tired of explaining
There's no book I've read that says what I'm saying
So show me the way, show me the way
Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you really want to get the root of me
You don't have to try so hard
If you wanna know how to get to me
Then follow the map to my heart

Just follow it, baby
To my, to my heart...
