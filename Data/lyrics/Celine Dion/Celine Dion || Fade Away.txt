
I learned from the past
Not everything lasts
I understand that now
Everything changed
When you walked away
But I'll survive somehow
Though I have regrets
I'll learn to forget
And just keep moving on
Cause when love is gone
You have to be strong
Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

So I try to smile
But after a while
The memories come back
But I won't give in
Cause I know that then
My heart will fade to black

And this time I learned
That love can burn
It's an all consuming flame
There's no right or wrong

I've got to be strong

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

I know that one day I'll find that feeling again
But until I do I'll do fine by myself

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
You know that

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away
