
Don't be afraid to feel this way
Gonna make you understand
It's not about you, cause I am the fool
Building castles in the sand 

If I am crazy, just don't care
It doesn't mean I don't want you near,
This is the story about me and you
And it's called... 

Faith! 
Right beside you is where I'll stay 
Oh Faith ! 
Just take me as I am... so please... have faith! 

So many times and so many ways 
I didn't know just where to go, 
You gave me a sign and opened my eyes 
That's the reason why I know 

That you are different, you're still here
I guess you figured me out right then 
Now I believe that we can make it through 
And that's called... 

Faith! 
Right beside you is where I'll stay 
Oh Faith! 
Just take me as I am... so please... have faith ! have faith ! 

So don't be afraid... to feel this way... 
Just hear me out! 
Stay... 

...and that's called... 

Faith! 
Right beside you is where I'll stay 
It's not too late 
Just take me as I am... so please... have faith... In me!

Oh yeah! 
Just take me as I am... so please... have faith!
