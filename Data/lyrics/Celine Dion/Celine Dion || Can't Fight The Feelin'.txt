
I feel a little peculiar 
Feeling kinda strange 
I don't know what it is 
But I like the change 
That comes over me 
Whenever he's around 
It's as if my feet 
Don't even touch the ground 

Cause when I'm feeling down 
He's there to pick me up 
and when I talk too much 
He doesn't interrupt 
Let me tell you there's no better guy 
This is how it makes me feel inside 

I wanna dance (dance) mmm 
I wanna play (play) 
Well can you hear my heartbeat (boom boom) 
A million miles away 
He won't stop (stop) no no 
Till I drop (drop) yeah 
And every day and night he tells me 
I'm so special that he never could give me up 

I'm hooked on a feeling 
A natural high 
You better believe it 
And the reason why 
It's a thing called love 
It makes me feel so alive 
And I can't fight the feeling 

Somebody told me once 
You only get one chance 
So live your life 
And do the best you can 
Once a day goes by 
You never get it back 
So live every minute 

Like it was your last 

Just dance (dance) mmm 
Come on play (play) 
And tell somebody you love them (I love you) 
At least once a day 
And don't stop (stop) 
Till you drop (drop) 
I didn't know that one day someone so special 
Would come along to steal my heart 

I'm hooked on a feeling 
A natural high 
You better believe it 
And the reason why 
Is a thing called love 
It makes me feel so alive, yeah 

Love, love, love 
And John Lennon said 
That was all you need 
If you taste it once 
It won't be enough 

I'm hooked on a feeling 
A natural high 
You better believe it 
And the reason why 
Is a thing called love 
It makes me feel so alive 
And I can't fight the feeling 

Can't fight the feeling 
I said, no, can't, can't, can't 
Can't fight the feeling 
Can't fight, oh! 
You better believe it 
You better believe it 
Can't fight the feeling
