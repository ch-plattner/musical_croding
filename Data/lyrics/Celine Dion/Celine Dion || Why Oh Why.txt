
Don't you know that your my reason
For my love, my life, my being
So secure and so damn sure my
Heart would surely die without you

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why,
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye

How can you tell me it was nothing
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in
Just a night and I held you tight
When you know you were sleeping in my bed

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why,
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye

[Solo:]

Should I quietly leave through the door
Or maybe pretend the way things were once before
When I met you
I'll never forget you, so

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why,
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye
