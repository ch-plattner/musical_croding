I remember L.A.
Seems a lifetime ago
We were stars on Sunset Boulevard
What a movie we made

There were days in the sun
That have stayed forever young
Nights when passion was invincible
We tought love would never die

[Chorus]
There were moments in that lifetime
That my heart still replays
There were minutes, there were hours, there were days
There are moments I still love you that same way
When I remember L.A.

I remember goodbye
I watched your plane out of sight
Love was over, time to close the book
Still I go back for one last look

[Repeat Chorus]
