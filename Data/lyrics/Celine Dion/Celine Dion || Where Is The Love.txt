
If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled sky's....from 
Falling...falling...falling.

If ever the river could whisper your name,
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain,
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings & fly,
Guide your spirit safe & sheltered,
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

If ever a boy stood on the moon,
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.
Together we'd chase the sun.

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
The love that answers a mother's cry?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings & fly,
Guide your spirit safe & sheltered.
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

A boy stood on the moon
The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
That we can still believe
We can still believe
We can still believe
