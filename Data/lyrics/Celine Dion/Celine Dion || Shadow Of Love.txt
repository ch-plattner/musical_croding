
live my life like a runaway
I hide my dreams in a special place
I'm waiting here for my prince to come
To save me from the darkness

I count the nights, I count the days
The ways, yeah
Don't wanna fight, it would be in vain
So in vain, so in vain

I can run but I can't hide
It's because... I'm living in the shadow of love
Yeah, yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
I'm living in the shadow of love

Your love surrounds me, it's everywhere
It is my shelter, it is my air
A moon eclipse and a burning sun
Make a shade just for me

For you I wait forever and a day
Yes I would
To be there if your love should come my way
My way

I can run but I can't hide
It's because... I'm living in the shadow of love
Yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
I'm living in the shadow of love

Too many nights, too many days
I've hidden from the sun
And though I've tried to break away
Your hold on me is just too strong

I love you in the shadow of love

I can run but I can't hide
It's because... I'm living in the shadow of love
Yeah
To me you are the only one I dream of
Cause I'm living in the shadow of love

It's because... living in the shadow of love
Shadow of love, yeah
I can run but I can't hide
It's because... the shadow of love
Shadow of love
