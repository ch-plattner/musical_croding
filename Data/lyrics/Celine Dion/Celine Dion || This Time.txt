
One more hour burns
So scared of his return
That I can't sleep tonight
In this hospital light

You call a tragedy
Is just another day to me
For my heart beats with fear 
As his footsteps draw near

The life I meant to lead
Won't slip away from me..

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me, and as I bleed
You just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies 
Are not enough
This time..

There's nothing left of this
Your wispered words and empty threats
Rip away the seams of what I thought this would be
The last thread has come undone
To reveal what I've become
Another victim of a poison love

I've been afraid for years
But that won't keep me here..

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me 
To just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies
Are not enough
This time..

What remains a mystery
You can not have the best of me
So I'm taking back 
All you took from me

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me 
To just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies
Are not enough
This time..
