Circle 'round like butterflies
Escape the pourin' rain
Run into the alleyways
Steal a little kiss again

You're my only weakness
But somehow you make me strong
After chasin' ghosts and fairytales
I'm right where I belong

And I don't know where I've been lookin'
And I don't care where you have been before

But I'm thankful to be here
Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm Thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feelin' alive again
Thankful that hearts always mend
I write it all on paper dolls
Let them play their little games
Of who loves who and what is true
No one ever takes the blame

I see you through the window
And it takes my breath away
And I lose the floor beneath me
And all that's left to say is

I don't know where I was goin'
And I don't care where we have been before

But I'm thankful to be here
Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm Thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feelin' alive again
Thankful that hearts always meant

And I caught rainbows falling down
When I stopped spinnin' around and around and around

But I'm thankful to be here
Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm Thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feelin' alive again
Thankful that hearts always meant
