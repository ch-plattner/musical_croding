
There's a tree, standing there
In such an ordinary way
But as I, Look around
Everything keeps changing

There's a leaf on that tree
And it floats into a stream
Like everything, it gets carried away
To the sea

And if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle every night and day
If we could hear just a whisper of what the heart needs to say
It could sure make a difference in some small
In some small way

In the heart lies the key, 
That unlocks your desitiny
Look within and we'll find, 
Everything we're longing for

And if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle every night, everyday
If we could hear just a whisper of what the heart needs to say
It could sure make a difference in some small
In some small way

Ohhhhhh may you cherish each moment you live
And know all the love that you give will go on, and on and on

There's a sky, vast and blue
And it lies deep inside of you
Breath it in, let it out
Breath it in again

And if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle every night, everyday
If we could hear just a whisper of what the hearts tryin to say
It could sure make a difference in some small
In some small way

And if we give a little of our love away
Maybe meet in the middle every night, everyday
If we could hear just a whisper of what the hearts tryin to say
It could sure make a difference in some small
In some small way
