
Jesus
I will follow
For each step is forgiven and never long
And as we walk
Through miles of disbelief
It will be his hand that guilds you
Leading you home
He'll say "you carry on, a new day will come"
I know it will yeah
You carry on
I know, I know a new day will dawn
Yes it will

I am woman
A mountain I will climb
Oh yes I will
I've been beat down and I've been broken
And each day I give it another try
Oh yeah

We will carry on
A new day has come
We will carry on
I know a new day will dawn

Oh yeah
I've been broken
Yeah
New day will dawn

We will carry on
Yes we will
A new day will come
Carry on, carry on
New day will dawn

A new day will come
I am woman

A New day will dawn
