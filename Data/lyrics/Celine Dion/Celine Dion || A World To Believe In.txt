
I've seen the tears and the heartache, and I felt the pain
I've seen the hatred in so many lives, and lost in vain
And yet through this darkness there's always a light that shines through
And takes me back home
Takes me back home

All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]
You gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me your love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

I know that dreams we hold on to, can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted, with so much to say
And I when I feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe
Makes me believe

And I see for one fleeting moment
A paradise under the sun
I drift away and I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Life goes on
Can leave all sweet sorrow and pain
And life, hold on
To all that you are
To all that we'll be
And I can go on once again

[Chorus: x2]

Because your love hears my soul once again
I can live and I can dream once again
Because you made me believe
