Thought I could define it,
One look in your eyes when it proved me wrong,
I find myself speechless,
This feeling of completeness is so strong,
And I was convinced that my heart had reached it's limit,
Until you created this new place in it,

Your touch wraps around me,
In love that knows no boundaries,
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you,
You're the answer I've been needing,
Life has a whole new meaning, now,
All because of you,

Everything is different,
There's no frame of a reference for the way I feel,
But to look at your face,
I am still amazed, I can't believe you're real,
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep,
Hanging on every breath that you breathe,

Your touch wraps around me,
In love that knows no boundaries,
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you,
You're the answer I've been needing,
Life has a whole new meaning, now,
All because of you,

Your touch wraps around me,
In love that knows no boundaries,
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you,
You're the answer I've been needing,
Life has a whole new meaning, now, 
all because of you,

In love that knows no boundaries,
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you,
You're the answer I've been needing,
Life has a whole new meaning, now,
All because of you,

Your touch wraps around me,
In love that knows no boundaries,
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you,
You're the answer I've been needing,
Life has a whole new meaning, now, all because of you,
All because of you...
