There ain't a dream that don't
Have a chance
To come true now
It just takes a little faith baby
Anything that we want to do
We can do now
There ain't nothing in our way baby
Nothing our love couldn't raise above
We can get through the night
We can get to the light
Long as we got our love to
Light the way
With a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love baby love can
Move mountains

Ocean deep and mountains high
They can't stop us
Because love is on our side baby
We can reach the heavens and
Touch the sky
Just believe it, believe in you and I baby
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything, make it 
through anything
'Coz through it all love will always
Find a way

With a little faith, , , 

You believe in me
I'll believe in you
If we believe in each other
Nothing we can't do
If we got love that's strong enough
Love will find a way

With a little faith
