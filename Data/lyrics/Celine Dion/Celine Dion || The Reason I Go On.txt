
When I'm feeling down 
The mention of your name
It lifts my spirit up.
It makes me carry on,
When I don't have the strength
Your faith can heal me.
Like the sun that shines
You gave me light to see.

Catch me cause I'm falling,
I'm so lost, inside your love.
Can't you hear me calling
To your heart,
Cause your the one reason I go on.

Could I find the words to tell you how I feel.
With one look from your eyes.
I know what heaven's worth
So whats in everything
To hold and touch you.

Your the air I breathe,
The reason my heart beats.

Catch me cause i'm falling,
I'm so lost, inside your love.
Oo can't you hear me calling,
To your heart, cause your the one reason i go on.
The reason i go on, yeah.

Baby I'm just dreaming but my hope it keeps me strong.

Oh, catch me cause i'm falling,
I'm so lost, inside your love
Oo can't you hear me calling,
To your heart, cause your the one reason i go on.
