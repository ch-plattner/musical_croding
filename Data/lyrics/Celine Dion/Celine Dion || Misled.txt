I tought I knew you
Tought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm
But I guess you never can tell

Oh I learned early
Never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind

Lovin' you (was) so easy
It's hard to say goodbye
But if it's the way it goes it goes

[Chorus]
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled

Loving somebody ain't your average 9 to 5
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm movin', movein' on

[Chorus]
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled
