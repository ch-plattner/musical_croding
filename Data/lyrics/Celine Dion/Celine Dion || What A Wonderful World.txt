(Thank you...so very much!
I would like... on behalf of all the dancers,
The musicians, the singers, the technicians...
People you didn't even see during the show tonight,
Who are part of this amazing family!
I want you to know that we loved performing for you...
I loved singing for you... you were a great audience! Thank you very much!)

I see trees of green... red roses too
I see 'em bloom... for me and for you
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue... and clouds of white
Bright blessed days.... warm sacred nights
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.

The colors of a rainbow... so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces... of people going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin'.. how do you do?
They're really sayin'... I love you.

I hear babies cry... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more... than I'll never know
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself... what a wonderful world... oh yeah!
