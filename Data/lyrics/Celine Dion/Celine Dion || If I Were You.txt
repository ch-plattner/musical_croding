She can feel you
Drifting far away
But she can't see through
What you do not say
Take a step back
Don't lose your ground
Remember how you felt before
And if you care about her
Show her that you're sure

If I were you
My prized possessions
Would be the ones I'd hold so close
'Cause when you lose your love
You lose what means the most
If I were you
I'd hold affection

Higher than any star in sight
Take this to heart
And you'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I were you

Simple pleasures
The hardest to be found
Can't be measured
'Till they're not around
Maybe she'll go
Maybe she'll stay
But she'd rather go than fade away
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow
Is the saddest fate

[Chorus]

Take a step back
Don't lose your ground
Remember how you felt before
And if you care about her
Show her that you're sure

If I were you
I'd hold affection 
Higher than any star in sight
Take this to heart
And you'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I were you
Take this to heart
You'll never part
These are the things that I would do
If I were you
