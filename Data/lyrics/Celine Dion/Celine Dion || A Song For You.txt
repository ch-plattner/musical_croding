
I couldn't live 
I couldnt live without your love
for one kiss 
well I'd give everything up
there's no words I can describe
what I feel deep inside
so I let this song say it all

Then I hope you'll understand
once you've listened till the end 

Heard the music in my head
so before I could forget

I start singing 
yeah I was singing
this song 
for you

Just made up the words
la la la ohhh ohhh yeah
my heart with a melody

so I am singing 
this song 
for you
