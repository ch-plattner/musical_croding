You don't have to give me rings on my fingers
Promise me the moon and the stars in the sky
Or bring me roses just to show me you love me
That ain't gonna win this heart of mine
All the diamonds you can buy won't impress me
Pretty words ain't gonna prove your love
I need more than just tokens of affection
I'm not asking for too much now baby
I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the heart, , , whoa

I need real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me that real emotion
'Coz I need some
Need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine
Real emotion, real emotion

Show me something that my heart can believe in
Imitation love don't mean a thing
Baby it's gonna be the real thing or nothing
Show me what's it gonna be now baby
I'm not asking much from you
Just a love that's deep and true, , , whoa

I need real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me that real emotion
'Coz I need some
Need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine
Real emotion, real emotion

Not a cheap imitation of love
I need something that's real
I can feel in my heart baby
I've been waiting so long
For a love, for a love, for a love that's strong
I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the heart, , , whoa

[Chorus]
