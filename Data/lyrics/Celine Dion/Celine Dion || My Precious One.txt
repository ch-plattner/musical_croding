
My precious one, my tiny one, lay down your pretty head.
My dearest one my sleepy one, it's time to go to bed

My precious one, my darling one; don't let your lashes weep.
My cherished one, my weary one; it's time to go to sleep.

Just bow your head and give your cares to me.
Just close your eyes and fall into the sweetest dream, cause in my loving arms.
You're safe as you will ever be so hush my dear and sleep.

And in your dreams you'll ride on angels' wings.
Dance with the stars and touch the face of God
And if you should awake...

My precious one, my tiny one
I'll kiss your little cheek
And underneath the smiling moon
I'll send you back to sleep.
