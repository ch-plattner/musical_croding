It's so sad what we have become
Beautiful days we seem to leave so undone
And I don't know where we will go from here
All I know is that I can't seem to see the sun 
Through the sky from here

Everyone has a finger 
But they can't point me to the light
It can't be that hard to find 
After all we're so bright

I don't know if tomorrow has a day
I don't know if the rays will shine my way again
All I know is that I'm standing in a place where
My future is like the skies of L.A.
Skies of L.A.

Skies of L.A.

I don't know if my body can take much more
We're in the line of the richest riches
But my mind seems so poor

Everyone has a finger 
But they can't point me to the light
It should't be that hard to find 
After all we're so bright
I see so many visions 
But everyone seems out of sight
This is total neglection
Skies of L.A.
