
Surprise, surprise
I told you lies
I thought the truth would set you free
Surprise, surprise
It isn't all as it seems
But who knew you'd wake up from your dreams

If I told you myself
I could've saved you the hell
Now look who's sorry, God, I'm so sorry
It's never the right time
I guess it's do or die

Just when you think you've got me figured out
Just when you think you know me well
Baby, you've barely even broke the ice
My river runs wide
You're not in sight
But you're closer than you were

Tonight, I'm a chameleon
And every spot's hiding my scars
But I will survive
Cause I'll only let you in
When I can be sure of who you are

And you can call it a game
But it's me playing safe
And God I'm so sorry, I'm just so sorry
What can I say?
It's hard trying to stay alive

Just when you think you've got me figured out
Just when you think you know me well
Baby, you've barely even broke the ice
My river runs wide
You're not in sight
But you're closer than you were

You were tonight, tonight, tonight

And it's in your eyes
That it's all or nothing
What I can't disguise
Is that you're on to something
I let myself go, will you still want me?
Will I be enough? The fear of that haunts me
'Cause what if you walk away?

Just when you think you've got me figured out
Just when you think you know me well
Baby, you've barely even broke the ice
My river runs wide
You're not in sight
But you're closer than you were

You were tonight, tonight, tonight

Just when you think you've got me figured out
Just when you think you've got me figured out
Surprise, surprise
