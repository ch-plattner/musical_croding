
Somewhere tonite we come alive
Two hearts ignite we're one of a kind
Here we are undivided by anything
Just you and I
We've come so far no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wasn't to know?

We stick together we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one we do it in Unison
We come together and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one we do it in Unison

Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile
Never too shy playin' ever so wild
Here we are I'm relying on no one else
But you and I we've come so far
No one else could ever steal away what we
Confide who wants to know?

Rockin' as one there's no time to stop
I know what we've got we do it in Unison

Here we are undivided by anything
Just you and I
We've come so far no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?
