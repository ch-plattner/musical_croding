Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - 'til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I wanna know you
Lets talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Lets talk about love
