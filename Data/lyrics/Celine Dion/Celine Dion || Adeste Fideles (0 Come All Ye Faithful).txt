Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels!

Glory to God -
Glory in the Highest

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning
Oh Jesus, to Thee be the glory giv'n
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.
