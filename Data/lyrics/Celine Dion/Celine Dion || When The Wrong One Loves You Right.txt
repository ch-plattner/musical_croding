
i don't care, what they think
how they feel, or what they say
your're everything, i ever knew
i always wanted, baby
i've been warned, so many times
they tell me i've ignored the signs

but nobody knows you like i do
the only one for me is you

getting tierd, of hearing that
you're dangerous, but they wont stop
until i leave, they wont belive
that being with you wont break my heart
so worried 'bout, the road ahead
they can't see that, your my best friend

there never gonna take me from you
there's nothing they can do

how can i walk away
when the feeling's so strong
i know you're where i belong
they say i let my heart 
make up my mind
that's why i'll never say goodbye

i can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it
when the wrong one loves you right
(oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
can't run-can't hide-can't say no
when the wrong one loves you right
(oh-oh-oh-oh)
when the wrong one loves you right
