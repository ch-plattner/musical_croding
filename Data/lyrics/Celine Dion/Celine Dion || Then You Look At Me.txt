
Laugh and cry
Live and die
Life is a dream we're dreaming

Day by day
I find my way
Look for the soul and the meaning

Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore

People run
Sun to sun
Caught in their lives ever flowing
Once begun
Life goes till it's gone
We have to go where it's going

[Chorus]

And you say you see
When you look at me
The reason you love life so
Though lost I have been
I'll find love again
And life just keeps on running
And life just keeps on running
You look at me and life comes from you. From you.
