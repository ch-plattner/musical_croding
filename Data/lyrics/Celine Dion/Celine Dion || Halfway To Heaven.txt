
Come and go with me
Wherever I am I want you to be
Walking with your hand in mine
Feel so fine

When I'm close to you
I know what it means to want to be true
Never felt this way before
Is there more

Are you feeling the same as me honestly
Don't you think it's unreal
I'm not dealing in fairy tales
If this fails
I don't know what on earth I will do 'cause I'm
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love

When we reach that place
I'm dying to see the smile on your face
I'm so sure you'll want to stay
That's okay

I have so many dreams to share
Please be there
Let me share them with you
If you're looking for happiness nothing less
Come with me, baby I'm looking too and I'm
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling now
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love

I don't want to give my life in moderation (baby no)
I'm prepared to give myself up to temptation it's time
I could use a little love and inspiration (baby now)
Come and share the joy and join the celebration
It's time
Hoping and praying that soon you'll be saying be mine

I don't want to give it up
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love
You're makin' all my senses come alive
