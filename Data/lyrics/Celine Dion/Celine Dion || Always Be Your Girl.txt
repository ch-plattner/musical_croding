I listen to my heartbeat and I try to follow where it leads me
That's right, I don't wake up in the shadows anymore
I can finally breathe

I did a little deep-down searchin'
Took a little time to work it through
But I found everything the day that I had you

I once was the lost one
Like a wayward child
Now you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl

I'm pickin' up all the pieces
When I put 'em back together I'm like new
'Cause my greatest wish has already come true
We'll always be connected, baby
Like a button to a sleeve
And this lullaby will send you off to sleep
It's hard to imagine my life before you
'Cause you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl

I'll be holdin' the wrap if you come on and fall
There's love after love after all
We'll always be connected, baby
You're like a button on my sleeve
And this lullaby...

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I will fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it better than it was for me
You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world since you're my boy
I'll always be your girl

Your girl
