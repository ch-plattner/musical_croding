
Seven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass,
It's been nearly an hour since I thought of you.

But you're not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least by that I'd know that you're ok.
A guy like you ain't meant to go away.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess we're like water and a flame,
Water and a flame.

I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out,
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a guy that looked like you,
I did not know just what to do
It took a pile of will to break my step
I realize what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess we're like water and a flame,
Water and a flame.

And if you see me comin',
Look away, look away.
And if you're mind is made up,
Look away, look away.

And if you're worried about me,
I'm okay, I'm okay!
Yes I am!
Oooooo.
Ohhhh.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong,
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess we're like water and a flame,
Water and a flame.
