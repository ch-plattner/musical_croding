Did you ever fall in love
At the right time or place 
Does it always have to move
At its own kinda pace

When you're driving on cruise control
Coming up a bumpy ride 
And your heart is back in shape 
Then it hits you with no chance to hide

But don't you miss out on the way 
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
But I didn't do that 
(You gotta) Give it a shot 
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(But I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Tell me that you played it safe
Coz you're afraid to hurt your neck
On the rollercoaster train,
Never knowing what you get

You think you wanna be cynical,
Wanna date the best in me
Giving up the greatest trash,
Who knows what it turns out to be

Don't you miss out on the way 
Don't find a reason to say 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
(But I didn't do that)
(you gotta) give it a shot
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(but I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Ooohh

It's meant to be,
But don't think about it
Let love run free,
Coz you're on your way

Follow your heart where it's calling on you, 
Don't you say...

But I didn't do that, 
I didn't do that baby
Gotta believe it...

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
Oh!, but I didn't do that 
You gotta give it a shot 
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that 
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Didn't do that
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back
