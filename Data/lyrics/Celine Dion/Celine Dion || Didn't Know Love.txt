
I thought I had it long ago,
I held on, but it let go.
It kissed me on a subway train
And I melted...

It got my hand it brushed my cheek,
It moved right in, it cut me deep.
You know it even had a name,
I really felt it.

I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known,
It's making me weak,
Making me strong,
It's making me 'fraid I'm gonna wake up
And find it gone,
I didn't know love.

It's a blessing, it's a curse.
You know you've found it when it hurts.
It can drive you off a cliff,
But it's worth it.

Careful where you spend the night,
It's complicated when it's right.
You can make me such a mess,
Yeah you're perfect!

But I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever know,
It's making me weak,
Making me strong,
It's making me 'fraid I'm gonna wake up
And find it gone,
I didn't know love.
I didn't know love.

Now you're lying in my arms, beside me.
In the past I'd settled for a touch,
I'd tell myself it was enough,
I was lying, lying, lying.

Coz I didn't know love,
Mmm...

I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known.
It's making me weak,
Making me strong
It's making me 'fraid I'm gonna wake up and find you gone.

I didn't know love,
I didn't know love,
I didn't know love.
I didn't know love.
