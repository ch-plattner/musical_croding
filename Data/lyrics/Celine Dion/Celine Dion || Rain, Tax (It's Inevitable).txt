
I did not know there was a plan
Somewhere a perfect man
I don't believe in the stars
Then you smiled at my pretense
As you broke down my defenses
Just want to be where you are

Love ain't like fashion
The look remains the same
I'll wear your heart forever
'Cause some things never change

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks
(It's inevitable)
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
(It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you

Thought that life was logical
Love was a miracle
That happened to someone else, not me
Baby, I must've said a little prayer
Suddenly I looked up and you were there
And the rest is history

I don't want to be an island anymore
Just resign yourself
'Cause there's one thing for sure

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks
(It's inevitable)
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
(It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you

It had to be you
It had to be you

Say you'll be here forever
You and me here together
When will you see what I want
What I want is you

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks
(It's inevitable)
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
(It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks
(It's inevitable)
Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks
(It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you
