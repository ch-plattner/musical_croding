I was walking dead
Stuck inside my head
I couldn't get out
Turn the lights down
The voices inside so loud

Need a jump-start, catatonia
I couldn't feel,
I wish that I could disappear
The voices inside so real

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night.

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
We lovers again tonight.

Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah, yeah.

You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive
You loved me back to life,
Back to life, thought I died.
The voices inside so quiet.

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night.

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
We lovers again tonight.

Strong hand, thick skin and an open heart
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask
You never gave up on me, yeah

Life, life
From the coma.
The wait is over.
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
We lovers again tonight

Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Yeah, yeah...
