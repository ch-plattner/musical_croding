
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
some place better than where you're been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend
I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
coming closer, sweet release
I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you
I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend
A hot dry win blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
coming closer, sweet release
I am calling you
can't you hear me
I am calling you
