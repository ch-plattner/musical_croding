Sometimes tears say all there is to say
Sometimes your first scars won't ever fade away
Tried to break my heart 
Well it's broke
Tried to hang me high 
Well I'm choked 
Wanted rain on me
Well I'm soaked 
Soaked to the skin 

It's the end where I begin 
It's the end where I begin 

Sometimes we don't learn from our mistakes 
Sometimes we've no choice but to walk away, away 
Tried to break my heart 
Well it's broke
Tried to hang me high 
Well I'm choked 
Wanted rain on me
Well I'm soaked 
Soaked to the skin 

It's the end where I begin 
It's the end where I begin 

Now I'm alive
and my ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain
I've been holding on 
The cure for a heart 
Is to move along, is to move along
So move along
[X3]
What don't kill a heart
Only makes it strong 

It's the End where I
End where I 
End where I begin 

Sometimes we don't learn from our mistakes 
Sometimes we've no choice but to walk away, away
