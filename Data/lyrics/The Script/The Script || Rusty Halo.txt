It's been a long time coming
Ye it's been a long time coming
But you know you had it coming
You know you had it coming

Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running

Now I'm looking up the bible tryna find a Loophole
Yeah I'm living for revival, dying for a new soul
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo

It's been a long time coming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo

Now I'm running for the light in the tunnel but it's just the train
Yeah I'm looking for the right type of pleasure but all I find is pain oh
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo

It's been a long time coming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

I gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo

[2x]
Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
