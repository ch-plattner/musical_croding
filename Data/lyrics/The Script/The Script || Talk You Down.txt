
I can feel the colour running
As it's fading from my face
Try to speak but nothing's coming
Nothing I could say to make you stay

Grabbed your suitcase, called a taxi
It's 3 AM, now where you gonna go?
Gonna stay with friends in London
And that's all I get to know

Just a cigarette gone
No, you couldn't' be that far
I'm driving my car to where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down

Oh, we're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide

'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.

Taking shortcuts through the alleys
While you're racing through my mind
Cops can chase but they won't catch me
Not before I get to speak my mind
If there's still time

Just a cigarette gone
No, you couldn't be that far
I'm driving my car to where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down

Oh, we're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide

'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.

We're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head, oh.
We're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head.

Just a cigarette gone
No, you couldn't be that far
I'm driving my car to where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down

Oh, we're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide

'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.
'Cause if you go, I go.
