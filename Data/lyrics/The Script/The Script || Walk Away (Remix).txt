[The Script]
I don't know why shes with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
If I was her, by now, I would've left me
I woulda walked away
But now I broken the way
But still somehow she forgive me
She said a woman gotta do what she got to
Even if it means she denying herself the truth
Cause when you in too deep you wake up it's too late
Fallin in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me

[B.o.B]
Yo
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk
Why are we up this hour knockin pictures off the wall?
Tell me what does that resolve
I guess its my fault
The truth is never easy when you gotta get it off
And girl I'm so exhausted
Yes, all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way I that am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
If this ain't what you want then you should leave

[The Scrpit]
But still she stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
But still she stays
Shes standing in the heart of darkness
Saying I know you got a soul even though your heartless
How could any woman in her right mind
Be so blind, to finding something to say
Instead of walking to me she shoulda (walked away)
She finds color in the darkest places
She finds beauty in the saddest of places
She's such a cute(?), head strong city girl
Coulda had the world
But ya falling in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me

[B.o.B]
As I fall, a thousand miles an hour
Downward, not a chokehold (?)
I guess its true, words have power
I guess what I said left a taste so sour
In your mouth ya wanted me to see what life's like withoutcha
So I lay awake, watchin' DVDs
Season 1, season 2, even season 3
I'm sorry that I couldn't be inside your fantasy
But if this ain't what you want then you should leave

[The Script]
But still she stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
But still she stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
I don't know why shes with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
If I was her, by now, I would've left me
I woulda walked away
But you fallin in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me
So walk away

[B.o.B.]
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk
And girl I'm so exhausted
Yes all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way that I am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
If this ain't what you want then you should leave

[The Script & B.o.B]
But still she stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
But still she stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk
Walk awayyy (walk awayyyy)
I see you walk away (walk away, walk awayyy)
But still she stays
