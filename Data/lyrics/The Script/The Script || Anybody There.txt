My head is saying no
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there under my skin

Well if this is the face of a sinner
And if heaven is only for winners
Well I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there

Thought that I'd let it slide
But it's me that's slipping in
Thought that I'd go for a ride
Before this crash I'm dying in

Well if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not so forgiving
Well I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there
I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there

My head is saying no
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there under my skin

Well if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not so forgiving
Well I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there
I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there
Oh, I don't care 'cause I won't know anybody there

Is there anybody there [3x]
