
When love’s a battle
And life’s a war
When I just can’t go on fighting anymore
When I’m surrounded
And they’re closing in
When I feel the bullets graze against my skin

This world’s a war zone
But I’ve got a shield
And I won’t surrender
'Cause your love feels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels

Hey hey
If hate is poison then loves the cure
And it’s you that drives the demons from my door
When they got me cornered
Close to giving in
Oh, I feel you round me like a second skin

This world’s a war zone
But I’ve got a shield
And I won’t surrender
'Cause your love feels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels

Through the flames and the fire I will go
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that I’m not alone
Through the flames and the fire I will go
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that I’m not alone

Oh, what a beautiful sight whoa
A hundred thousand soldiers in the sky whoa
I don’t need to worry tonight
With you by my side, yeah

Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels, angels, angels

Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels

Through the flames and the fire I will go
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that I’m not alone
Through the flames and the fire I will go
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that I’m not alone
