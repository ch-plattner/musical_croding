
We live today like there's no tomorrow,
We sell our souls and our time is borrowed,
We stole from heaven now there's hell to pay,

So you better hope that there's something higher we're getting old and we're none the wiser,
We better hope that there's something higher we're getting old and we're none the wiser, we're none the wiser.

We fill our minds up but our hearts are hollow
We hate the truth cos it's hard to swallow
We're judged on what we do not what we say,

So you better hope that there's something higher we're getting old and we're none the wiser,
You better hope that there's something higher we're getting old and we're none the wiser, we're none the wiser.

Tell me how long must we ride this rollercoaster,
Tell me how long till we're back on solid ground
If we don't stop to look a little closer, whenever I see, whenever I see we're slowing down,
Before I, before I how much can we take,
Before we die, before we die how much can we break, can we break?

We better hope that there's something higher, we're getting old and we're none the wiser,
What we don't know now we'll know, what we don't show now we'll never show
What we don't know now we'll know, what we don't show now we'll never show
What we don't know now we'll know, what we don't show now we'll never show
What we don't know now we'll know, what we don't show now we'll never show

You better hope that there's something higher we're getting old and we're none the wiser,
