I've been kicked right down
I've been spat in the face
I've been pulled, weighed down
To the lowest place
I've been lied to, shamed
I have been disgraced
Been ex-communicated from every holy place
I've been beat up and robbed
I've been left for dead
For the way I look 
For the things I said

When trouble thinks it's found us
The world falls down around us 
I promise baby you won't ever
You won't ever feel a thing

[Chorus:]
Cause I will take it on the chin
Eh, for you
So lay your cuts and bruises over my skin
I promise you won't feel a thing
Cause everything the world could throw
I'll stand in front. I'll take the blow for you.
For you.

I've been cleared on the street
I've been left in the cold
Had my dreams held up
Had them shot full of holes
I've been laughed at, burnt, beat and butt of the joke
I've been lit up in flames
I have gone down in smoke
I've been stabbed in the back
While they promised the earth
Tried to keep my head high
For all I am worth

Aside I'm double blazing
I know when war is raging
I promise baby you won't ever
You won't ever feel a thing

[Chorus]

Yeah.
And if I fall here
At least you know my dear that I would die for you
Promise you won't ever feel a thing
And if I fall here
At least you know my dear that I would die for you
Promise you won't ever feel a thing

[Chorus]

Yeah everything the world could throw
I'll take the sticks, I'll take the stones for you
For you
