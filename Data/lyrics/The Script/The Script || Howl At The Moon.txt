
When I was younger
I'd pray for thunder
A thousand angels banging on their chairs
The white of all the lightning was never that frightening
Like cameras all flashing in the air

And oh, after it would clear
The wonders of the universe they seem so near

Lying in my backyard
Head is facing skyward
I'd imagine all the things that I could be
A pilot or a fighter
An astronaut or writer
Anything except just being me

And oh, the bells would start to ring
Words came to my head and I would start to sing

With the moon as the spotlight
That shines on me
And the stars were the lighters in the air
And the wind screaming loud sounded just like a crowd
And I swore I was already there
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon

Now that I'm older
And life's a little colder
You're told you need to let go of your dreams
Everything changes
They stare at blank pages
I had the dream but couldn't find the key

But oh, some nights I hear the strings
These melodies in my head I have to sing

With the moon as the spotlight
That shines on me
And the stars were the lighters in the air
And the wind screaming loud sounded just like a crowd
And I swore I was already there

I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon

It keeps getting louder
It keeps getting louder
It keeps getting louder
It keeps getting louder
It keeps getting louder
It keeps getting louder

With the moon as the spotlight
That shines on me
And the stars were the lighters in the air
And the wind screaming loud sounded just like a crowd
And I swore I was already there

I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
I'd howl at the moon
