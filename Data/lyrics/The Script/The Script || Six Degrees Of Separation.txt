
You've read the books
You've watched the shows
What's the best way no one knows, ye
Meditate, get hypnotized
Anything to take it from your mind
But it won't go, ohhhh ohhh
You're doing all these things out of desperation
Ohhh ohhh
You're going through six degrees of separation

You hit the drink, you take a toke
Watch the past go up in smoke, ye
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
Well it's not, no
You're doing all these things out of desperation
Ohhh ohhh
You're going through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit you may have fucked up a little

(Oh no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)
(No no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)

You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Tarot cards, gems and stones
Believing all that shit's gonna heal your soul
Well it's not, no

You're only doing things out of desperation
Ohhh no
You're goin' through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit you may have fucked up a little

No there's no starting over
Without finding closure
You'd take them back, no hesitation
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

Oh, no there's no starting over
Without finding closure
You'd take them back, no hesitation
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit you may have fucked up a little

No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself
You're goin' through six degrees of separation

No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself
You're goin' through six degrees of separation

[x3: fading]
No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself

You're goin' through six degrees of separation
