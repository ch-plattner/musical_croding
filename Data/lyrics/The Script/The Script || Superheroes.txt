
All her life she has seen
All the meaner side of me
They took away the prophet's dream for a profit on the street

Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

All his life he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show

'Cause he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You see fire in their eyes

'Cause he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

(Power, power, power, power, power)
(Power, power, power, power, power)

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

(Power, power, power, power, power)
(Power, power, power, power, power)

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

She's got lions in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
'Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode

She's got lions in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
'Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode, explode, explode, explode

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

(Power, power, power, power, power)
Oh, yeah...
(Power, power, power, power, power)

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

(Power, power, power, power, power)
(Power, power, power, power, power)

Ooh, yeah
Whoa

(Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power)

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
