
I'm gonna leave this place
I made a snap decision
I'm gonna find another earth
And start my own religion
Yeah, I'm shooting through space
Where there ain't no division
I'm gonna see some shapes
You won't see on the television, no, no, ooh-oh, oh

The countdown started on the day we parted
Leaving you is hardest
Till the song kickin' in and I'm ready to go

I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission, yeah
I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm in a far off place
That's stranger than a distant land
I cut my parachute off
Oh, to see if I could stand
I'm headed for a great new world
Somewhere where there ain't no fears
It's gonna look and sound the same
Only difference is that you're not here
You're not here, no

The countdown started on the day we parted
I've been brokenhearted
Till the song kickin in and I'm ready to go

I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission
I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah [x3]

She said why [x4]
She said why you always getting out your face, boy
She said, you're never happy while you're livin' in this place, boy
She said, why you always leaving us behind, boy
You're always, Why you always out of your mind

I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission
I've got my moon boots on
Yeah, I'm a man on a mission
I've built a rocket to the sky
Gonna say goodbye
Gonna cut off all transmission
Yeah, yeah, yeah [x4]

I'm gonna leave this place
I made a snap decision
I'm gonna find another earth
And start my own religion
