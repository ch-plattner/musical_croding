I know you’re missing home
It’s been so long since you’ve been
And that life you had in Dublin
Now ain’t nothing but a dream
To be right there in the moment
You’d give anything to be

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

Your friends are on the phone there
It's so close to Paddy’s Day
And it kills you not to be there
But life got in the way
If I had to break the bank
Spend every penny on your dreams

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Let’s color the streets like our own
Let’s make this place feel like our own
It’s just you and me

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

And we travel on the subway
Like it was the Luas line
Chase the Hudson to the Liffey
Where we kissed for the first time
Turn the city into Dublin
Yeah, wherever we may be

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Let’s color the streets like our own
Let’s make this place feel like our own
It’s just you and me,

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Let’s color the streets like our own
Let’s make this place feel like our own
It’s just you and me,

It’s alright
‘Cause tonight
We’re gonna paint the town green

Paint the town green
Paint the town green
