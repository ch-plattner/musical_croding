If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

She said I Won the battle but I lost the war
And now my head is sore
And If I try to sail back in
She's gonna push me from the shore
Now I won't ever get the time of day
No way, no way, no
Not for what I said but for what I didn't say,
What I didn't say, so

If you see Kay
Will you tell her that I love her
And if you see Kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens, say I'm missing
Everything about her
Make sure you say I'm sweet FA without her
If you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

She got me saying sorry through the door
She don't care anymore
She says it's too late now
Should have thought of this before
But I ain't gonna take this as defeat
No way, no way, no
'cause I'm gonna shout it out to everyone I,
Every one I meet

If you see Kay
Will you tell her that I love her
And if you see Kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens, say I'm missing
Everything about her
Make sure you say I'm sweet FA without her

If you see Kay

Now I'm sitting here in disbelief
At how it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs
They say you love someone enough you gotta set them free
See she was born to leave this town behind
Knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied
Saying it's time to cut the ties
Time to say goodbye, so she left
But she never never left my, never never left my mind

If you see Kay
Will you tell her that I love her
And if you see Kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens, say I'm missing
Everything about her
Make sure you say I'm sweet FA without her
And make sure you say I lost my way without her
If you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay
