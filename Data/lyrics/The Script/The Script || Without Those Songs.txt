Would Dylan be just a poet?
Would Bono ever know it without those songs?
Would Marley be just a stoner?
Johnny Cash just be a loner without those songs?
Would Buddy Holly have disappeared?
Or would Lennon still be here without those songs?

What happened in their lives?
What happened in their hearts?
To make them want to write the words
Gonna tear this world apart
The beauty of their lives
Is when they're dead and gone
The world still sings along
When anything went right
When anything went wrong
They put it in a song

Would Elvis be just a look
Or the Rolling Stones be stuck without those songs?
Would Sinatra be just a gangster
Or would Jackson be just a dancer without those songs?
Would Madonna be just a face?
Or Nirvana be just a place without those songs?

What happened in their lives?
What happened in their hearts?
To make them want to write the words
Gonna tear this world apart
The beauty of their lives
Is when they're dead and gone
The world still sings along
When anything went right
When anything went wrong
They put it in a song
