Together we cry

Jenny was a poor girl, living in a rich world
Named her baby hope when she was just 14
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
When she gets that call, Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way, with nothing left inside
Together We Cry

What about the John Play, could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage tryna get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way, something for the pain
Man you wanna see this kid he was so fuckin' unreal
When he gets that call, he's too far gone
Can't get it together to sing one song
And they won't hear tonight the words of a lullaby

Together We Cry [X4]

Mary's ambition, she wants to be a politician
She's been dreaming about it since she was a girl
She thought, that she'd be the one who could change the world
Always tryna pave the way for women in a man's world
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar,
Checks that don't go very far now
Now she ain't making changes, she keeps her mind on her wages
The only rattling cages are her own

Together We Cry [X4]

There's so much sad gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for a world that's broken

Together We Cry

There comes a time when every bird has to fly
At some point every rose has to die
It's hard to let your children go, leave home, where they go, who knows?
Gettin' drunk, gettin' stoned all alone
Teach a man to fish, feed a man for life
Show your kids the truth, and hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better
Bet you're sorry now, I won't be coming home tonight

I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
To teach us how to fly
Together we cry, we cry, we cry

Together We Cry
Together We Cry

there's so much sad gonna flood the ocean
With all the tears from a world that's broken

Together We Cry [4x]
