Sometimes we fall down and can't get back up,
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough,
How come we don't say I love you enough,
Till it's too late, it's not too late,

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come, 
We could make a feast from these crumbs,
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun, 
So if your life flashed before you,
What would you wish you would've done,

Yeah gotta start,
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here,
This is all we've got and we gotta start thinkin' it,
Every second counts on the clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying,

We only got,
86,400 seconds in the day,
To turn it all around or throw it all away,
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em,
While we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying,

And if you're plane fell out of the skies,
Who would you call with you're last goodbyes,
Should be so careful who we let fall out of our lives,
So when we long for absolution,
There'll be no one on the line,

Yeah gotta start,
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here,
This is all we've got and we gotta start thinkin' it,
Every second counts on the clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying,

We only got,
86,400 seconds in the day,
To turn it all around or throw it all away,
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em,
While we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying,

Like we're dying oh - like we're dying [X2]

We only got,
86,400 seconds in the day,
To turn it all around or throw it all away,
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em,
While we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying,

You never know a good thing till it's gone,
You never see a crash until it's head on, 
All those people right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till It's gone,

Yeah gotta start,
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here,
This is all we've got and we gotta start thinkin' it,
Every second counts on the clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying,

We only got,
86,400 seconds in the day,
To turn it all around or throw it all away,
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em,
While we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying,

Like we're dying oh - like we're dying [X2]

We only got,
86,400 seconds in the day,
To turn it all around or throw it all away,
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em,
While we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying...
