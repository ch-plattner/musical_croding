
When's the day you start again
And when the hell does you'll get over it begin
I'm looking hard in the mirror
But I don't fit my skin
It's too much to take 
It's too hard to break me
From the cell I'm in 

Oh from this moment on
I'm changing the way I feel yeah
From this moment on 
It's time to get a real

Cause I still don't know how to act
Don't know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
Cause you're long gone 
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
But you're long gone, you moved on

So how'd you pick the pieces up yeah
I'm barely used to saying me instead of us
The elephant in the room keeps scaring off the guests
It gets under my skin to see you with him
And its not me that you're with

Oh from this moment on
I'm changing the way I feel yeah
From this moment on 
It's time to get a real

Cause I still don't know how to act
Don't know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
Cause you're long gone 
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
But you're long gone, you moved on

No I can't keep thinking that you're coming back
No
Cause I got no business knowing where you're at
No
And its gonna be hard yeah
Cause I have to wanna heal yeah
And its gonna be hard yeah
The way I feel that I have to get real

I still don't know how to act
Don't know what to say
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
But you're long gone 
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way
Still talk about you like it was yesterday
But you're long gone and moved on
But you're long gone, you moved on

But you're long gone, you moved on
eh eh, oh oh
eh eh, oh oh
But you're long gone, you moved on
