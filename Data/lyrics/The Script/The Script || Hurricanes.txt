
Neither one of us is getting out of here alive
Both of us are stranded and we won't make it back inside
The whole world is blowing away
We just watch it pass us by
Yeah, it swept up both our
Feet when we meet in the northern sky

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind, I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

We're heading towards each other at 150 miles an hour
Knocking us off course with the force once you feel the power
We're tryna get away, tryna clear the path
From everything we buried in the aftermath
Swell like a super cell, raging getting louder and louder

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

On my own I'm just another cold rainy day
Waiting for the wind to come along and take me away
But she's just a breeze on a sunny day
Unless the two of us together
Man, we're blown away

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

Away hurricanes away hurricanes
