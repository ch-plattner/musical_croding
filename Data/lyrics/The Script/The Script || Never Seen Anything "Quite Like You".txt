I think I want you more than want
And know I need you more than need
I wanna hold you more than hold
When you stood in front of me
I think you know me more than know
And you see me more than see
I could die now more than die
Every time you look at me

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you

When it's right it's more than right
Cause you feel it more than feel
I could take this moment now
Right into the grave with me

Oh well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight

In your eyes oh in your eyes
In our hearts yeah in our hearts
Sometimes words just ain't enough
For this love that's more than love

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
