They're kicking us out sayin' it's time to close
We're leaning on each other tryin' to beat the cold
I carry your shoes and I gave you my coat, yeah
We're walkin' these streets like they're paved with gold
Any old excuses not to go, neither one of us wanna take that taxi home

We were singin' our hearts out, standin' on chairs
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires
Laughin' our heads off, the two of us there
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires, millionaires 

Lost my heart and I hope to die, see in that sunlight hit your eyes
Been up all night but you still look amazin' to me, yeah 
Had the type of night you only dream about
If God came down he could take me now
Cos in my mind, yeah we will always be

Singin' our hearts out, standin' on chairs
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires
Laughin' our heads off, the two of us there
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires, millionaires 

Look at us, it's 6 in the mornin'
If time was money, then we'd be worth a fortune
I swear, you may think you're rich
You can have a million euros but you can't buy this

Look at us, it's 6 in the mornin'
If time was money, then we'd be worth a fortune
I swear, you may think you're rich
You can have a million euros but you can't buy this

And the band was on, playin' our song
We messed up the lyrics as we sang along
But we didn't care, cos it felt like we were the only ones there
Our feet were sore, our throats were raw
They're turnin' out the lights but we're shoutin' more, we're shoutin' more

Singin' our hearts out, standin' on chairs
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires
Laughin' our heads off, the two of us there
Spendin' our time like we were millionaires, millionaires

Look at us, it's 6 in the mornin'
If time was money, then we'd be worth a fortune
I swear, you may think you're rich
You can have a million euros but you can't buy this

Look at us, it's 6 in the mornin'
If time was money, then we'd be worth a fortune
I swear, you may think you're rich
You can have a million euros but you can't buy this

We're walkin' these streets like they're paved with gold
Any old excuses not to go, neither one of us wanna take that taxi home
