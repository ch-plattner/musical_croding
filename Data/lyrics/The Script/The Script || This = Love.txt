
It's in the eyes of the children
As they leave for the very first time
And it's in the heart of a soldier
As he takes a bullet on the frontline
It's in the face of a mother
As she takes the force of the blow
And its in the hands of the father, yeah
As he works his fingers to the bone, yeah

I'm standing under a white flag oh
Can you see me oh
Can you see me oh
I'm standing for everything we have oh
Can you hear me oh
Can you hear me

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down
And get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this, this is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down
And get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this, this is love

This is love
This is love
This is love

It's in the soul of a city
What it does after it crumbles and burns
And it's in the blood of a hero
To know where he goes he may never return

I'm standing under a white flag oh
Can you see me oh
Can you see me oh
I'm standing for everything we have oh
Can you hear me oh
Can you hear me

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down
And get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this, this is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down
And get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this, this is love

This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love

If you could be anywhere that you wanted to be
With anyone that you wanted to be with
Doing anything that you wanted to do
What would it be and who would it be with you
Time flies but you're the pilot
It moves real fast but you're the driver
You may crash and burn sometimes

This is why we do it
This is worth the pain
This is why we fall down
And get back up again
This is where the heart lies
This is from above
Love is this, this is love
Love is why we do it
Love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down
And get back up again
Love is where the heart lies
Love is from above
Love is this, this is love
