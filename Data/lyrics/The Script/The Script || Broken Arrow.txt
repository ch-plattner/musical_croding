
This time he's gonna wear an iron suit
This time she's gonna fix her heart and make it bulletproof
He says he's gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit
She says never never bite more than you can chew
But this time he's not gonna be another could have been
This time she's gonna get real, love the skin she's in
He says a winner never quits, quitters never win
She says this time that she is built to face anything
This time he's gonna stand for who he is
This time she's gonna live to work, she's not working to live
He says just because you say it's true, it don't mean it is
She says if it seems too good to be true, well then it probably is
This time he's hell bent, yeah he's heaven bound
This time she's gonna pick herself up, no more breaking down
He says he's gonna turn the wheel, turn this shit around
She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found, no

When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
You fall off course,
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound

This time he's gonna make it through the aftermath
This time she's gonna raise her head and choose the righteous path
He says one day we will look back and it will make us laugh
She says better to have and not need, than to need and not have
No matter what the cost, it's better to have loved and lost
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall
You have to choose something cause you can't have it all
No, he's not gonna be the last to the finish line
She says think big, cause even losers get lucky sometimes
He says it's gonna get better like a fine wine
She says it's hard to smell the roses when the sun don't shine
This time he's gonna find another way
This time she's gonna take it to the good ol' days
With no airs or graces, only warm embraces
We're just two little street angels with dirty faces

When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
You fall off course,
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound

Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound

Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,
Everything you've learned it's all programmed, all programmed
Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,
Everything we've learned it's all programmed, all programmed
When you hit the ground,
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound

Shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
You fall off course,
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound

Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when you're born hell bound
Broken arrow
