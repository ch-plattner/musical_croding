
We're late to bed
We're early to rise
Wipe the sleep from our eyes

We head to work
We catch a lift
We have a smoke and we start this shift?

We open up,
We start to wake
Maybe it's gonna be our day
And suddenly
We start to smile
The sun is out for a while

And you may see this place and find no worth
But it's a little piece of heaven here on Earth

Yeah, we always have a good time
Whether it's hail rain or it's sunshine
Yeah, we're all living the good life
Whether it's hail rain or it's sunshine

We reach the top
We took the fall
But we laughed through it all
Cause dreaming of them better days
Has always been our way

And you may see my friends and find no worth
But, no, I'll never go and change them for the world

Yeah, we always have a good time
Whether it's hail rain or it's sunshine
Yeah, we're all living the good life
Whether it's hail rain or it's sunshine

Yeah, we always have a good time
Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine
Yeah, we're all living the good life
Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine
