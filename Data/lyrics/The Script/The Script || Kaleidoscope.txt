
Give me highs, give me lows,
Give me thorns with my rose
I want everything
When you laugh, when you cry,
If you're sober or high,
I want everything

Give me love or hate,
You can bend me 'til I break
Give me fire, give me rain,
I want joy with my pain
I want your fears, your hopes,
The whole kaleidoscope

With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, oh oh ooh yeah

Give me nothing, give me faith,
I want give with my take,
I want everything
Give me life, give me death,
All your biggest regrets,
I want everything

Show me your fears, show me your scars,
I'll take whatever's left of your heart
Give me heaven, give me hell,
All the dreams you try to sell,
I want your fears, your hopes,
The whole kaleidoscope

With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, oh oh ooh yeah

Without you it's shadows, the night's black pitch,
There's a hundred thousand light bulbs but there ain't no switch
Living in darkness, fearin' the night,
Oh what a feeling when I see that light

With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, with you
Our colours come alive when I collide
With you, oh oh ooh yeah
