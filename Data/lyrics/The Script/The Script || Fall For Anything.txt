Girl that brings you down, down, down

Don't give yourself away
Don't live your life that way
Of course he's gonna say anything you want
Then leave quicker than he came
Now you've got yourself to blame
Don't put yourself back in the fire again

It's the same damn things you're so quick to believe
You do it over and over again
And it's the same mistakes that I'm watching you weave
You do it over and over again
So before they bring you down

You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Girl that brings you down, down, down

Please don't be so na√Øve, don't wait 'til your heart bleeds
Love wasn't built for speed, listen to me girl
He keeps fuckin' with your head, tryna get you into bed
And in the morning you'll just hate yourself

It's the same damn things you're so quick to believe
You do it over and over again
And it's the same mistakes that I'm watching you make
You do it over and over again and over again
So before they bring you down

You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Girl that brings you down, down, down

[3x]
And you give until there's nothing to give
Until there's nothing to give,
until there's nothing to give...

Before they break you down

You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Before they bring you down, down, down
Girl they'll bring you down, down, down
