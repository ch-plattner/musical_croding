My hands are cold, my body's numb
I'm still in shock, what have you done?
My head is pounding, my vision's blurred
Your mouth is moving, I don't hear a word

And I hurt so bad, that I search my skin
For the entry point, where love went in
And ricocheted and bounced around
And left a hole when you walked out, yeah

I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds?
I don't know how much more love this heart can lose
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds
Wounds!
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping
Exit wounds
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping

Marks of battle, they still feel raw
A million pieces of me, on the floor
I'm damaged goods, for all to see
Now who would ever wanna be with me?

I've got all the baggage, drink the pills
Yeah, this is living but without the will
I'm backing out, I'm shutting down
You left a hole when you walked out, yeah

I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds?
I don't know how much more love this heart can lose
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds
Wounds!
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping
Exit wounds
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping

[x4]
Lose your clothes and show your scars that's who you are

Marks of battle, they still feel raw
A million pieces of me, on the floor

I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds?
I don't know how much more love this heart can lose
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds
Wounds!
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping
Exit wounds
Where they're leaving, the scars you're keeping
