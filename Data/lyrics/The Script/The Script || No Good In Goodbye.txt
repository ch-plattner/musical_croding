
All the things that we've lost
Breaking up comes at a cost
I know I'll miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way I'm gonna lose
Can't take the ache from heartbreak

Oh, but as you walk away
You don't hear me say

Where's the "good" in "goodbye"?
Where's the "nice" in "nice try"?
Where's the "us" in "trust" gone?
Where's the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now I'm the "low" in "lonely"
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak

No, I can't take the ache from heartbreak

No matter how it falls apart
There's an "art" in breaking hearts
But there's no fair in farewell, no
And when I see you in the street
I pray to God you don't see
The silent "hell" in "I wish you well."

Oh, but as you walk away
You don't hear me say

Where's the "good" in "goodbye"?
Where's the "nice" in "nice try"?
Where's the "us" in "trust" gone?
Where's the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now I'm the "low" in "lonely"
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak

(take the ache, take the ache)
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
(can't take the ache from heartbreak)

If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines [4x]

Where's the "good" in "goodbye"?

Where's the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now I'm the "low" in "lonely"
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak

(take the ache, take the ache)
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
No I can't take the ache from heartbreak
(take the ache, take the ache)
(can't take the ache from heartbreak)

If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines
