I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man 
[2x]

I see you standing there but you're already gone
I'm holding your hand but you're barely holding on
I'm kissing your lips but it just don't feel the same
Am I dead there now, left living with the blame
Oh I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
Already see it, in your face
Already someone, in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking

I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man

We're in the same room just one million miles away
With all these books around but we ain't go two words to say
Am I a dead man now, left living with the shame?
I'm...

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
Already see it, in your face
Already someone, in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking

I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking

I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man

Already broken, already gone
Already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
Already see it, in your face
Already someone, in my place
I'm a breathing, talking
Dead man, walking
