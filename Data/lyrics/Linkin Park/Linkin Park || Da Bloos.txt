I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks

I said baby, I said baby
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks

Gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks
I'm gonna tie you up
Leave you down there by the railroad tracks
When the train comes by, it's gonna take you away
Ooh yeah
