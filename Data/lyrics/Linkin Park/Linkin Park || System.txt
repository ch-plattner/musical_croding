
You fell away, 
What more can I say? 
The feelings evolved, 
I won't let it out, 
I can't replace... 
Your screaming face, 
Feeling the sickness inside

Why won't you die? 
Your blood in mine…
We'll be fine…
Then your body will be mine

So many words 
Can't describe my face
This feeling's evolved
So soon to break out 
I can't relate
to a happy state
feeling the blood run inside

Why won't you die? 
Your blood in mine…
We'll be fine…
Then your body will be mine

Why is everything so fucking hard for me? 
Keep me down to what you think I should be! 
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry?

Keep on trying I’ll not die so easily

I will not die…

Why is everything so fucking hard for me?

I will not die…

Why is everything so fucking hard for me?

I will not die… 

Why won't you die? 
Your blood is mine…. 
We'll be fine…. 
Then your body will be mine [x2]
