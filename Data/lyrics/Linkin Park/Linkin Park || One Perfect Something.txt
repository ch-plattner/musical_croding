
It was nothing but a fantasy (I knew it)
But I had a lot of fun before (I blew it)
Isn't that what everybody says
That you can't eat the cake if you piss on it

I put my money on a card roulette
And I kept my smile as I placed my bet
I knew what I did when I went on the ride
It's a 5-align credit on the wild side

You showed me how
It was too good to be true
And that I should grow up
And start sniffing the glue

But it's all around me
To the left and the right
And it's eating me up
And spitting me out

If you've never seen a failure
(then here's one!)
I was doomed before I ever begun
I was on board drinking
When titanic went down
And the band played on as I ordered a round

That's just how it goes
Don't you think I know?
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

I won't stop the show
I just let it flow
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

I don't ever want to stand in line (you get it?)
Cause I could find a better waste of time (you bet it)
Everybody wants a piece of the pie
So I take what I want and I never ask why

If you wondered what would make me up
Then you'll self combust if you smell the glove
I'm a time bomb running out of batteries
And with fellows like you
I don't need no enemies

That's just how it goes
Don't you think I know?
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

I won't stop the show
I just let it flow
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

That's just how it goes
Don't you think I know?
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

I won't stop the show
I just let I flow
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

That's just how it goes
Don't you think I know?
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

I won't stop the show
I just let it flow
you don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face)

(Tell it to my face)
(Tell it to my face)
(Tell it to my face)
