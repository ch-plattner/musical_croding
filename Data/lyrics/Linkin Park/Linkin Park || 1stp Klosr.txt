
I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
’Cause I’m one step closer to the edge
And I’m about to break

I’m about to break
This room to breathe
This room to breathe
This room to breathe

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I’ve said before
All these words, they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You’ll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren’t so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I’m about to break

Everything you say to me
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I’m about to break

These are the places where I can feel torn from my body
My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like
I’m about to break
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate, I have never missed
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring

Shut up when I’m talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up when I’m talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
I’m about to break

Everything you say to me
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I’m about to break

Everything you say to me
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I’m about to

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
’Cause I’m one step closer to the edge
And I’m about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I’m about to break
I need a little room to breathe
’Cause I’m one step closer to the edge
And I’m about to
