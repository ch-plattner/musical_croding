It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 

I've been taking into crates ever since I was livin in space 
Before the ratrace, before monkeys had human traits 
Mastered numerology and bigbang theology 
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it 
And chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of the emcees that hate us 
So try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity let icons be bygones 
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this 
I've tried threats but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplis 
(Mixed media) 
The stamp of approval is on this 

It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 

Akira, put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones 
Never satisfy my rhyme jones 
Sprayin bright day over what you might say 
Blood type krylon
Technicolor type A 
On highways right with road rage I'm patient to win 
The cage and the tin to bounce all around 
In surround sound devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings 
Overall the same things sing songs karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stand at attention (Attention) 
Meant to put you away with the pencil 
Pistol, official, 16 line rhyme missile 
While you risk it all, I pick out of your flaws 
Spin, blah blah blah blah 
You can say you saw 

It's high voltage you cant shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you cant shake the shock
