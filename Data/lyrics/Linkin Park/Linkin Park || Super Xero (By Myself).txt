
What do I do to ignore what's behind me?
Do I follow my fate and escape blindly?
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I let it go and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them redhanded?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live life in lonliness?

The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I'm lost within
I put on my daily fa√ßade but then
I just end up gettin' hurt again

[pre-chorus:]
By myself (Myself)
I ask why (but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

[chorus]:
I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer...

[pre-chorus and chorus]

How do you think
That I've lost so much
I'm always afraid
That I'm out of touch
How do you expect
That I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you (know)
I can't tell you how to make it (go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (try)
I can't seem to convince myself (why)
I'm stuck on the outside
[x2]

[chorus]

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure from with...(in)
