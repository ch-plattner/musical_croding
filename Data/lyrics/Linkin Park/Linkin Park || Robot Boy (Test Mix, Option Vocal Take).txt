
You say you're not gonna fight cause no one will fight for you
Cause you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you say that faith is a lie and fear is your only truth
And you're sure that everyone else is feeling the way you do
You say you've hurt for so long that pain isn't something new
But don't think the things that they've done predict what you're going to do
The truth is that trust is a gift it's something we all can lose
So hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to
Hold on, It's not where it goes it's where it can lead you to
