A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
Uh, this song's about jellyfish
And their bellyfish
Ain't no foolyfish
I don't droolyfish
Goes like this:

Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
Peanut butter jellyfish
Put me onto your sandwich

Said jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

My friends are fish and they go to school
They think I'm crazy and they think I'm cool
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

Got no eyes, I got no head
I've got no house, I got no bed
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish
Jellyfish
