
Listen,
My blood feels like it's sitting still in my veins
My motivation was gone before it even came
Today and yesterday, they both seem the same
And no matter how I try I just can't change
Give me one reason I should go outside
Everything I'll be the same no matter what I try
Some people'll live and some people'll die
Some people'll build their whole life on a lie
I used to blame you for the things that I thought you'd say
So now I can't blame you for going away
Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin
Repeating the same thoughts again and again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back, We want our own mistakes, to take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back, We want our own mistakes, to take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back, We want our own mistakes, to take our own path
We wanna do it again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back, We want our own mistakes, to take our own path
We wanna do it again
