It goes a one, two, three...

I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don’t need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don’t run the track no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my dad, he built rockets
I put ’em both together, now tell me what I got, it's
A pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it ’cause you clearly can’t stop it
Like that
It ain't over ’cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or if you’re right
’Cause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights
Except for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain’t standing next to you
I’d be laying on the ground before you’re even in my view
Like that
