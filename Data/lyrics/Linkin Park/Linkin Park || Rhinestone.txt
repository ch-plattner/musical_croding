From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stop to just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I've frightened the sky)
And I'm far from a rapist (Thinking why did I try)

From the thread to the needle; middle to end
Where skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully; the power of suggestion
Then, with the eyes tightly shut looking through the rust 
And rotten dust, a spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stop to just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I've frightened the sky)
And I'm far from a rapist (Thinking why did I try)

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up...
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Moving all around, swinging of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, cars, chainlinks, and concrete
A window then grows, and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with a needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the chain
When brains lose not knowing they were part of the game
And in the insides grow, the box stays the same in shame
Shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stop and just what I thought)
The sun has escaped us (So I've frightened the sky)
And I'm far from a rapist (Thinking why I did try)

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up...
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up...
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up...

(In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up...
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies keep piling up...)
