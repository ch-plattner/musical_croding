
Back, before I said goodbye,
Just as the first day turned to night,
Just as the concrete turned to dust,
And the steel turned into rust,
All I could think was I need a way to dig through the damage,
Couldn't think of a way to get through this,
Now I see you takin advantage,
And I found another reason to do this.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

Now, that I said goodbye,
Just as the darkness turned to light,
Just as the next light turns to day,
And the world gets underway,
All I can see is the anticipation,
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops,
And I waited patiently taking it in,
Ready for the first of the face offs.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

-NO!
