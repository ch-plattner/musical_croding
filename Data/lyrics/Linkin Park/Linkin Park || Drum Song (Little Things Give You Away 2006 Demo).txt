You don't believe in me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
Don't even care what you're breaking
And I'm not mistaken

The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

You don't believe in me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
Don't even care what you're breaking
And I'm not mistaken
The little things give you away
