We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, the early morning sings no more

We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more
The winds have torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more

We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more
The winds have torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more

'Cause time has torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more
