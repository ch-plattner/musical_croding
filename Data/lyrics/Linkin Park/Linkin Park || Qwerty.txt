
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take what I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday

There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow so it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home

And like that
Broken down
A victim of your plight

Fire so out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul

And like that
Broken down
A victim of you lies

You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your
Lies
You hide behind
Lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

I don't know what I thought I might say
Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought you might say so

I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow and you want to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallow me whole
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home

And like that
Broken down
A victim of your lies

You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You crossed the line
Wrapped inside your lies
You hide behind
Lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what would take me?
Analyzing by the power of your soul

Broken down, a victim of your
Faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

You hide behind
Lies
You don't know
Why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your
Lies
You hide behind
Lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies
