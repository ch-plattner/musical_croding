
You've been taking it all this time,
You left my trust on the firing line.
As the promises break, the only mistakes,
Giving you what was mine.
Your words are clear but their meanings gone.
The notes are right but the tunings wrong.
And when you tell me again that I should give in
I can only take it so long long long long

A%#! 
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

Fear is dancing inside your lies exposing secrets that you've disguised
And I'm biting my tongue as you become victim of a compromise
'Cause I know who you really are, not a scratch where you can take a scar
And it's time that you seek the truth without me 
I can only get you so far far far far

A%#!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

Throw it all away, all away, all away

A%#!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away
All away, you're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!
