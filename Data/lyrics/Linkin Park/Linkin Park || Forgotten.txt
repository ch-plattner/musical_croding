
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I’ve forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won’t escape me 
But why should I care 
[Chorus x2] 

There’s a place so dark you can’t see the end 
Skies cock back and shock that which can’t defend 
The rain then sends dripping / an acidic question 
Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
Then with the eyes shut / looking thought the rust and rot 
And dust / a small spot of light floods the floor 
And pours over the rusted world of pretend 
The eyes ease open and its dark again 

[Chorus x1] 

In the memory you’ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 

Moving all around / screaming of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind 
Street lamps, chain-link and concrete 
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats 
On down the street till the wind is gone 
The memory now is like the picture was then 
When the paper’s crumpled up it can’t be perfect again 

[Chorus x2] 

In the memory you’ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 

Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I’m telling you that 
I see it right through you 
[x7] 

In the memory you’ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
[x2]
