Man, the other day
I was trying to figure out how many letters was in the alphabet
It took me all day, but you know I did it
You wanna know how many letters there are?
26 letters in the alphabet!

26 letters in the alphabet
I wear a shower cap so I don't get wet
I put on my shoes so my feet don't hurt
And go to the floor with Ernie and Bert

When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

I got lots of friends, so I don't need pets
26 letters in the alphabet
Ernie got wasted and Bert went flat
They got kicked out and they can't come back

So they're standing outside, singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Yeah, they're standing outside, singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Yeah, you know they outside

Do the Ernie (Who's inside?)
Do the Bert (Who's outside?)
Shake your milky (Who's upside?)
Chocolate shirt (Who's downside?)
