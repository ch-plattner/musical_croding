[Verse 1]
Ridin' with a head full of buckets of red
And when I said is still stuck in my head
I'm full of red, thoroughly bled,
And led to the land of the middle combats
Comin' another front tack, can never run from that
From planets to a size as I'm milkin' the horizon
Smaller than the flies and, of a lyrical land
Of the power that I've got in my cynical hand
With the pen, once again swimmin'
In the centre of the hit or the miss
Readin' all my thoughts gettin' lost in the mist
Realise the one that the size of the fist
And the killin' of the killer with a flick of the wrist

[Chorus]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that its not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2]
And the second is gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
And turn into your half-life
Somethin' that math can't write
You can't fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me
Way back, would split up with my friends
So you can see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that?
Play back the thing now, gettin' lost in the chaos
Tossin' it down,
Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
Singin' the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine

[Chorus]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that its not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

[1:49]
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds, soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds!

[Chorus]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that its not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
Burn!

Singin' the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
Singin' the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
