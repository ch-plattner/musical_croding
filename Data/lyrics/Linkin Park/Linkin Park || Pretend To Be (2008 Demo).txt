You say that you're proud of me
Ooo, oo, oo, oo
And take somethin' out of me
So, oo, oow
Predictable
Why do I have to see this through
why do I have to take this
isn't there something I can do
to make myself finally say this

[Chorus]
No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be 

You're stuck with apologies
Ooo, oo, oo, oo
And take another shot of me
So, oo, oow
Predictable
Why do I have to see this through
why do I have to take this
isn't there something I can do
to make myself finally say this

[Chorus]
No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be 

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be 

Oo, Oo....

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be 

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be
