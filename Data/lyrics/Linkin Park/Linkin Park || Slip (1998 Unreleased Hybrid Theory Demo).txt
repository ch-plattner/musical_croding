
In the center of the silence 
The violent thoughts are thrown through
The thick smoke of flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back and I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back and I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

Sometimes you got no control of where you go
Taken down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost you want to hide your face
You don't recognize the place your in
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes the light's so bright it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay (Run away)

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back when I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

Follow the link in the chain without a name
Steal the light that darkens these remains
Take it away to the place you've been trapped
Break all you know to bring it all back

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back when I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them
Alone with me
