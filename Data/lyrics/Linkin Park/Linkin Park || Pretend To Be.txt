
You say that your proud of me
Ohhhohhohoh
And you take something out of me
So predictable
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn’t there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You’ve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see,
You’re not the one that you pretend to be

You start with apologies
Ohhhohhohoh
Then take another shot at me
So pretendable
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn’t there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You’ve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see,
You’re not the one that you pretend this
No
You’ve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see,
You’re not the one that you pretend to be

Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh

No
You’ve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see,
You’re not the one that you pretend this
No
You’ve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see,
You’re not the one that you pretend to be
