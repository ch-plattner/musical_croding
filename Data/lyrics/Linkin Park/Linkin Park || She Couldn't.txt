Won't be long till everybody knows.

I've seen her smiling,
The sunlight shining for her now.
She couldn't stay here,
She knows you won't let her down.

You know she couldn't stay here with you.
You know she had to go.
Even though she couldn't stay here with you,
You know you're not alone.

[2x]
No matter what you think you did wrong,
(Won't be long till everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along.
(Won't be long till everybody knows)

I've seen her shining,
The sunlight's crying for her now.
She wouldn't stay here,
She knows you won't let her down.

You know she couldn't stay here with you.
You know she had to go.
Even though she couldn't stay here with you,
You know you're not alone.

[2x]
No matter what you think you did wrong,
(Won't be long till everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along.
(Won't be long till everybody knows)

(Won't be long till everybody knows)
(Won't be long till everybody knows)
(Won't be long till everybody knows)

[2x]
No matter what you think you did wrong,
(Won't be long till everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along.
(Won't be long till everybody knows)

[Repeat until faded out]
No matter what you think you did wrong,
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along.
(You know she had to go)
