In the dark days, I'll part ways with the blame.
Trying to maintain, but it's still all the same. It's all a game.
Hear my name in the rain and the pain, I'm wearing my face with a tear stain
Your faint fondness, honestly it's time to give you a piece of my mind and show you that you're blind.
And in the design of the world I called "mine" know that you can't stand on both sides of the line.

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problem's have two faces
Pass all the blame over to me, it will come eventually
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

With my eyes shut, I'm seeing the truth in your words
They're absurd, slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit, the lies that you tell
The stories you sell, knowing you well, I keep distance
And every instance you keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel, just another spoke in the wheel
Kneel here or nothing, thrown down and trembled by your ego
And eaten away by my own version of the real

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me, it will come eventually
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

(Who's to blame?)

Nothing, thrown down
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel
(Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own
(Pass the blame cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real

Nothing, thrown down
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel
(Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own
(Pass the blame cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real
