
All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, to look behind.

All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, to look behind.

If you go, there's no turning back.
If you go, there's no turning back.
If you go, there's no turning back.
there's no turning back!

No, no, no, no, no, no...
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!

All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind.

All of these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, CAN'T LOOK BEHIND!
