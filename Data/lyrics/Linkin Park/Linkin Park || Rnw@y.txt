
Gra—
Grafitti sky

I don’t think you’re all ready
Yo, I don’t think you’re all ready

Grafitti decourations
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Still giving me away
The lessons I’ve forgotten
In spite of all I’ve learned
Now, I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to runaway (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Paperbags and angry voices
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Won’t seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now, I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to run away (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Going to runaway
Going to runaway (way)
Going to runaway
Going to runaway (way, way)
Going to runaway

Hey, y’all not ready
Hey, yo

I don’t think y’all ready for what I’m about to do
All you new-skool dudes ain’t even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zue Lue
Cool Herc and Jazzy J.
They paved the way
Let me spit it for y’all who said I wasn’t going to make it
Every time I blaze it, y’all the first to hate it
My team reigns supreme to stay strong
Got the true series, son
They scared to put us on
Can’t get with hybrids
Get off your hiatus
To many y’all’s dying for it
So, I got to blaze it
Still ripping BK, Brooklyn, B and on
Hell-fighting family, aliennation
Banging hits in the backyard while LP’s on
I’m a little communicate
Phoenix Orion

I want to runaway (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind
