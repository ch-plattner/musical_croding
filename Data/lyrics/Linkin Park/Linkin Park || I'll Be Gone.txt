
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now, it's time you let me know.
Let me know

[Chorus:]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now. Bitter sweet
And 'cross that horizon this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go

[Chorus:]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.

[Bridge:]
And tell them I couldn't tell myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me.

[Chorus:]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
