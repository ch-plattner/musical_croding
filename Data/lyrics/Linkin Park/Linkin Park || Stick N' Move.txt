Renound MC's surround as the beat breaks down 
In 2 elements clobbin' up those that have been blessed 
And it's the M-I see the way it ought to be ponessed 
Yes, yes am I the one to keep you on your toes 
Most...Definitely in my b-boy pose, its the..electric boogie with the slight twist 
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this 

Now see what I have, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 
Now see what I had, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 

MC's dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic 
Now it's like You Sit, You Stay 
Cobra path lifestyles I'm kickin' 
Stickin' MC's real quick 'cause times tickin' 
At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom 
Sendin', I shot of verbal heat up in 'em
The ending will come, grab your family and run 
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots from the sun 
Record in the world, four-thousand-eighty-one 
Question my intentions and your whole world is done 
Like wars to Rome, turn your eyeballs into Saturn 
Full metal jacket fully auto rhyme pattern 

Now see what I have, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 
Now see what I had, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 

Stick it, rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it, rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it, rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it, rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it 

Now see what I have, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move 
Now see what I had, I want you 
Be with me or Stick n' Move
