Of course you know what a fuse is... 
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder 
When you strike a match and light it 
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end 
At which there is, a little surprise 

Krypton, short suit MCs you'll be ripped on 
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you just slipped on 
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong 
Rock on, sing songs mightier than King Kong 
A Donkey, you think you want me or want this 
Want some, hold your reputation for Ransom 
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics 
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic 
Galactic, space now yeah that grabs attention 
Crack heads nodded like a pest can't even mention 
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections 
Kid steps this he need witness protection 

Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here 
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here

It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific 
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum 
Hear one, lalala loose frind me fearsome 
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone 
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth battalion 
Shallow the one who's run like rebels 
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level 
In intensity, send back the tax that you sent to me 
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me 
MP3 versus R33 MCs, Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze 
We're MCs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout you want these 
Please, don't even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it down like pens 
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the back of an MCs hand 
With the strength that he had a bridge you don't want that close body fields in hand to hand combat 
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords 
Come deford shots get rid don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked

Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here 
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here 
You want these MCs lyrically back smacks 

Go ahead
Suit yourself

Why wait, I didn't look down myself 
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself
Why wait, I didn't look down myself

Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here 
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here 
You want these MCs lyrically back smacks
