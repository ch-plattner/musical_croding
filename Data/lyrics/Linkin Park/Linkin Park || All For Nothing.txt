
Yeah
Uh
So whatcha waiting for?
Anticipating more
Why you debate what it can take to instigate a war?
Yeah I've been hating on the time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time
You're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4!

And if I do what you demand.
You say
You'll let me understand.
You say
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away.
You say
I"ll have no debt to pay.
You say
I'm gonna get what I deserve
Woah

Your word
Obeyed
My debt
Repaid
Our trust
Betrayed
All for nothing
All for nothing

Came back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya
I really don't know ya
You're talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
Your're joking I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw yah
I'm disgusted wonder what's gonna make you tuck your tail below ya
And no I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five star general infantry controller, need a lesson, let me show you.
Have you checking your composure while I make you step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4!

And if I do what you demand.
You say
You'll let me understand.
You say
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away.
You say
I"ll have no debt to pay.
You say
I'm gonna get what I deserve
Woah

And if I do what you demand.
You'll let me understand.

Your word
Obeyed
My debt
Repaid
Our trust
Betrayed
All for nothing
All for nothing

All for nothing
All for...
Oh oh oh oh
