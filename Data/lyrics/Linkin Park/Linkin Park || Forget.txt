
I cannot deal... again
I don't want to show my face to
the world today
It's like two different people live
inside of me
And you're so perfect
You left me living inside of this hole
I, tearing away from my soul
I, feel myself losing control
I'm living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your life
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
I've got to know
Living for nothing
I don't want to have to beg for
another way
All I ever really wanted was a
chance to say
That you're not perfect
You left me living inside of this hole
I'm tearing away from my soul
I, feel myself losing control
I, living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your live
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
I've got to know
Living for nothing
I don't wanna show my face,
show my face...
You left me living inside of this soul
I, tearing away from my soul
I, feel myself losing control
I, living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your life
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
I've got to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal (I cannot deal)
You left me all alone
I cannot deal (I cannot deal)
And I think for nothing
I cannot deal (I cannot deal)
You left me all alone
I cannot deal (I cannot deal)
And I live for nothing
