
Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never cease to amaze in minds
So I just sleep sleep sleep please don't
Wake me till the morning after [2x]

Cut and bruised by the fall again
Lick my wounds like a dog again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see I see please let it be but don't
Wake me till the morning after [3x]

Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when I'm
awake and alive alive alive
alive and I'm dreamin'

Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when I'm
Awake and alive alive alive
Alive and I'm dreamin'
