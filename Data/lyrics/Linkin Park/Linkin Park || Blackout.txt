[C. Bennington:]
I'm stuck in this bed you made,
Alone with a sinking feeling.
I saw through the words you said,
To the secrets you've been keeping.
It's written upon your face,
All the lies how they cut so deeply.
You can't get enough you take,
And take and take and never say.

No / you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down / You push it back down 
No / you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down / Black out / Blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault,
And swear that I am mistaken.
You said it's not what it seems,
No remorse for the trust you're breaking. 
You run but then back you fall,
Suffocate in the mess you're making.
You can't get enough you take,
And take and take and take and take,
Fuck it
Are you listening?

No / you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down / You push it back down 
No / you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down / You push it back down 
No / you've gotta get it inside 
You push it back down / You push it back down 
No / you'll never get it inside 
Push it back down / Black out / Blood in your eye

[M. Shinoda:]
Floating down / as colors fill the light 
We look up from the ground / in fields of paperwhite 
And floating up / you pass us in the night 
A future gazing out / a past to overwrite 
So come down / far below 
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down / far below 
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

[M. Shinoda and C. Bennington:]
Come down, oh.
Come down, oh.
Come down.
Come down, oh.
Come down, oh.
