
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend
Is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain
I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost
Wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh
Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end
And if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh
Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh
