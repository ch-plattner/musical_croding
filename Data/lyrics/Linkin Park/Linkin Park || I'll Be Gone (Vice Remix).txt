[Chester Bennington:]
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now
No deceiving now, it’s time you let me go
Let me go

I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

[Pusha T:]
King Push
Dope game keep callin'
Dope boys keep fallin'
Askin' me "What's my legacy?"
I just wanna die ballin'
I just wanna die pourin'
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together
Lonny, Lisa, meet Lauren (Wooo!)
Then I be gone, keep it movin', what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion (Yuugh!)
I'm stylin' on 'em, I'm swervin' on 'em
I know it's wrong, but life's a bitch and she turn me on!

[Mike Shinoda:]
Yeah, and to each his own
Hatin' ain’t something that we condone
Is the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit 'til your speakers blown
And y'all wanna cop a plea
Who you gon' talk to? Not to me
Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes 'til you talk to me
Word to Pusha, word to Vice
Built a track once and killed it twice
Built a stage up and killed the lights
Opening act was like "Fuck my life"
Y'all can love it, ain’t nothing wrong
Forget the hatin' that y'all be on
Enjoy it now because after long
Keyser Söze, I'll be gone

[Chester Bennington:]
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone

I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!
