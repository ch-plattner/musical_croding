before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is to fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, My pride is broken!

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is to fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is to fast
You just won't last

I won't believe a word you say
I'll cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
Swimming through a sea of hurt
My life, My pride is stronger.

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is to fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is to fast
You just won't last

Its time to sink or swim
Its time to sink or swim
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim!
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim!
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim!

Forfeit the game

Forfeit the game
