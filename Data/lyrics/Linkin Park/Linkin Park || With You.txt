
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy

And I’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant and I can’t bring you back

[Bridge:]
It’s true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

[Chorus:]
(I’m with you)
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
(with you)
You
Now I see
Even when I close my eyes
(with you)
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
(with you)
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn’t real
Now I'm trapped in this memory

And I’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you’re close to me
You’re still so distant and I can’t bring you back

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus:]
(with you)
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
(with you)
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes
(with you)
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
(with you)
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes
