
Come on

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

I’m with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isn’t real
I’m trapped in this memory
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

I’m with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, I won’t let you control my fate
While I’m holding the weight of the world on my conscience
No, I won’t just sit here and wait
While you weighing options
You’re making a fool of me
No, you didn’t dare try to say that you don’t care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No, it ain’t like me to beg on my knees
Oh, please, oh, baby, please
That’s not how I’m doing things
No, I’m not upset
No, I’m not angry
I know love is love, 
Love and sometimes it pains me
With or without you
I’ll always be with you
You’ll never forget me
I’m keeping you with me
No, I won’t let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
No, I’m not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I won’t let you go

No, no matter how far we’ve come
I can’t wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we’ve come, I
I can’t wait to see tomorrow

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
