
Landing in the Devil's drop, I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top, a push from death below
Brother fell protecting us, somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us in fields of earth and coal

Sailing out away from this, to ports of foreign shores
Let us not forget to miss the ones we can not hold

Landing in the Devil's drop, I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top, a push from death below
Brother fell protecting us, somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us in fields of earth and coal
