
I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame or the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly but it can get worse
'cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk

Ya'll oughta stop talking
Start trying to catch up mother fucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker

Lauryn said money change the situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a mother fucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma say it for the record
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Ya'll oughta stop talking, start trying to catch up mother fucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker

When they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone [x3]

And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker
