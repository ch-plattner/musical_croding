
Oh my sun, it won't shine,
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires, they won't burn,
But to blacken the memories I've earned.
And these walls, are so thin,
But they somehow keep holding me in.
'Cause I've pushed, and I know,
What's to come at the end of this road!

'Cause it goes through...

Well my sun, it won't shine,
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires, they don't burn,
Except to blacken the memories I've earned.
And these walls, are so thin,
But they keep on holding me in.
'Cause I've pushed, and I know,
That there's nowhere left to go!

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through...
