
Hear the voices in my head
I pretend it's all okay
(Do you hear the voices in my head?)
Always
When you consider a war
Cos you don't get what you want to
Remember the fact
You don't know what I'm in for
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me
And there's nothing undesired
Hey, don't try to understand
They take the upper hand
(Do you hear the voices in my head?)
Always
(Always, oh yeah)
[Chorus]
I try so hard but I can never find
The answers lost upon the other side
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out
Didn't mean to break in on the outside
I try so hard but I can never find
The answers lost upon the other side
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out
Didn't mean to break in on the outside
Here, I'm locked inside my head
You can't help me understand
(Do you hear the voices in my head?)
Deny the things I say, always
When you dream of a fan
Cos you don't know where they come from
Consider the facts
When they're moving in behind ya
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me
And there's nothing we deny ya
[Chorus]
Do you hear the voices in my head? [4x]
[Chorus (2x)]
