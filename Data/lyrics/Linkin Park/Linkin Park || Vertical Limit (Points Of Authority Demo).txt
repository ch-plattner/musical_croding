
Forfeit the game
Stop the talk show
Draw doubt the what
Your talked to know
Forfeit the game
'Cause tomorrow
When it's all done,
you reap what you sow

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

[Chorus:]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you have been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken

[Chorus]

Forfeit the game
Stop the talk show
Draw doubt the what
Your talked to know
Forfeit the game
'Cause tomorrow
When it's all done,
you reap what you sow

[Chorus]

[Chorus:]
You like to think you're never wrong – Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone – Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you – Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you have been through
(You live what you've learned)
