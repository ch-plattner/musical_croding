Bubbles, bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, bubbles
I ride my car on bubbles, bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles

Bubbles, bubbles
I blow a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I show a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I ride a plane on bubbles, bubbles
I go insane on bubbles
On bubbles

'Cause it's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S

It's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S
And an S

Oh bubbles, oh bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, and bubbles
I drive my car on bubbles, on bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles, yeah
