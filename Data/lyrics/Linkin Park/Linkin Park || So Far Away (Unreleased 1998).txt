[Verse:]
Save me now from this mess that I've created
All The souls have gone and I'm stranded here with doubt and fear alone
Tell me how I'm in fault for all this madness
I don't know what's wrong, but I cannot help but try to push it

[Chorus:]
So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I don't want to say it anyway

[Verse:]
Save me now I'm the mess I have created
And my soul has gone and for some reason all I do is push it

[Chorus:]
So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I don't want to say it anyway
So far away

It's so far away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I don't want to say it anyway

So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I don't want to say it anyway
