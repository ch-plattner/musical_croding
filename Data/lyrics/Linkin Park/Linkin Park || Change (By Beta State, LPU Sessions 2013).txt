When I'm sinking in a ship I can't control
And I'm sick with a smile I try and hide
Broken pieces of a lie, I can't let go

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began (and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began I swear, I'm gonna change

Here, I wait swimming in a sea of dark
I'm lost in the current of my faults
Here, I sink holding on with all I had
The tide will rise I'm gonna own what's mine

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began (and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began I swear, I'm gonna change

All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began (and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began I swear, I'm gonna change

I swear I'm gonna change

(all I want to do is break free)
(all I want to do is break free) I swear I'm going to change
