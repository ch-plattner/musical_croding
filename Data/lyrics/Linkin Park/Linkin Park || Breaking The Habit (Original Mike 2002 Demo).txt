Down on the floor
Back behind the door
I try to catch my breath again
I can't ignore
What's back behind the door
Wondering what's next again

I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

Memories consume, pacing in the room
Cleaning broken glass again
Suddenly soon you're leaving from the room
It's happening so fast again

I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

Crashing into walls
It never was your fault
So here we are again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight
