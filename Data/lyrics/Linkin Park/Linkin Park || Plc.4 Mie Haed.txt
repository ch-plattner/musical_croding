
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
But the sun doesn’t give the light to the moon assuming the moon’s going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me about things that you want back from me

I’m sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I’m so sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
You’ll see it’s not meant to be
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
You’ll see it’s not meant to be
I want to be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Two, two, three, three
Yo, yo, yo
Give me Energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep all the dram
Used to be a team, passed that baton
But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on
I don’t really give a dang
You p****d on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk
Now the battle’s on

So sick of you stressing
Sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place
To feed your face
If you don’t, we gon’ bump
Get it up here, crunk

You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best
Go, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me (get away from me), go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
Get away from me
