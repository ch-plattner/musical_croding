Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

Hey boy, what's going on
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumours- hey
How's your family
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to you and I

Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
'Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name

Should just hug you goodbye (baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise (so I guess)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(I'll come and love you to sleep)
And we can revisit us one more time
(revisit paradise for a while)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight (by your side)
(lullaby)

I should just hug you goodbye (see I know I should but boy)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(you just look so good)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(so I'll sing that song)
And we can revisit us one more time
(you like to hear me sing as we revisit us)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

(It feels, feels good)

I should just hug you goodbye
(I can't walk away
But I just can't walk away from paradise
From paradise so I'll take you home and sing to you baby)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(though I know that I should just)

I should just hug you goodbye
(oh I can't, ...cause you)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(you and I both know)
And we can revisit us one more time
(nobody else in our lives holds a candle to you and I)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

I should just hug you goodbye shhh!
(so hush pretty baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(mmm,it's just me and you yeah, as we relive the splendor of you and I)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(I'm gonna sing our sweet lullaby)
