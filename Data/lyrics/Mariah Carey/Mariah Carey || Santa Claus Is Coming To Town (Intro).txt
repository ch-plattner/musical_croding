You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice

Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout

I'm telling you why

Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town
Santa claus is comin' to town

The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland
All around the christmas tree

So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa claus (is comin' to town)
Santa claus (is comin' to town)
Santa claus is comin'
Santa claus is comin'
Santa claus is comin'
To town
