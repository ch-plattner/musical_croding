
Gypsy, sittin lookin pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go

Oh
I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Whoah can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Oh

You're such a secret
Misty eyed and shady
Baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle
Your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see
Just tryin' to say to you

You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Can't you see

No
No
No

You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You're bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache

You're bringin on the heartbreak
You're bringin on the heartache
