Walkin' on the wild side
Crusin for a goal
Baby baby baby, i'm out of control

Singin with the lampstands,
Hairdryer on the hair
Dancin on the light floor
Watching you over there

Its a ladies night
And i know it gon' be hot
Im'a gon bump and grind, and rock and roll
SEE ARE YOU EYE ESS EE CONTROL.
Bump and grind (SEEARE YOU EYE ESS EE)
Cruise control
Bump and Grind

With cruise control

Handle on da gearstick, flickin' it slow
Baby i'll be your gurlfriend so be lettin' me know
Later on at night i'll be tellin you soo
When you watch me on the dancefloor rockin it slow

Its a ladies night
And i know it gon' be hot
I'ma bump and grind and rock and roll
Baby Baby, throw me
C.R.U.I.S.E CONTROL

Oh Oh Oh yeah
Oo Oo Oo oh yeah
