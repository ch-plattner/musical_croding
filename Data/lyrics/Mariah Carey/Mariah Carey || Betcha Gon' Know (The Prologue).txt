Oh welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Oh welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel

Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going bout a hundred
Mascara runnin
Laughing out of anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroom

Betcha Gon' Know oh how it feels
(when I get you back)
Betcha Gon Know oh how it feels
(when your heart's been cracked)
Betcha Gon Know oh how it feels
(when we fade to black)
How it feels for real

And you see your whole world collapse
Imma la-la-la-la-la-laugh
Imma la-la-la-la-la-laugh
Imma la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face boy
Betcha Gon' Know oh how it feels

So I pulled to the side
Of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up
What my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze
Morning dew and sun rays
As I drive I hide my eyes
Behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house
Slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door
But you're there wide awake
You're like "Where you been?"
I'm like "Sorry, I fell asleep of Jasmine's sofa.
I could've swore that Rae Rae
Called you and told ya"
You're like "You okay"
I'm like "I'm alright.
Little sleep and I'll be fine."
But if you only knew
What was in the back of my mind
You already stung
But you really gon find out in time

[Chorus]

This is for real, for real, for real 
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real 
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real 
60 minutes for real

Baby, I had all the guns but not a word from you 
You got me all crazy, somewhere down the line your gon get what you deserve..you fucking jerk 
Your were supposed to save me, my sweet baby 
Now we are fading away..but your gonna know how this feels 
Even if it's the last thing I ever do 
To be continued...
