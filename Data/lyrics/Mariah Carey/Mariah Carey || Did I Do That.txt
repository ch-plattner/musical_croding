I really hope
When you hear this song
That you're happy
With somebody new
Baby because
I found a love I can call my own
And I owe it in part to you

[Mystikal:]
Can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

We can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

Can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

We can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

[MC:]
Yeah
Mhhhh

Don't you know that you seem
Just a little crazy
You had my trust and intimacy
But you threw it away just threw it away
And now it's all in the past
When I think of you
I just laugh
My friends must have thought
I was high to have given so much
To someone not worth my time

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
Oh
(Did I do that)

You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

You were so insecure
And your crew was so immature
Conversations painfully weak
You were much better off
When you didn't speak
But boy to tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being somehow destined for me
That had me in a daze
But we're not the same in truth

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
No
(Did I do that)

You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

I really hope when you hear this song
That you know it was meant for you
(You you you you you)
Though your attention span's not that long
Try to do the best you can do

[Mystikal:]
Can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

We can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

Can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

We can't stop now (uh) 
We can't stop (uh)
You can't stop (uh)
Don't try (uh)

[MC:]
No
We can't stop now
No

(It's funny how sometimes)
Funny how sometimes
(You can really lose your mind)
You can really lose your mind
(And do things you would never do)
Do the things you would never do

(You rhapsodize)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
(Fool)

[Master P:] It ain't my fault

[MC:]
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
(Do the things, do such stupid things)

You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And the things you would never do
I was such a fool
But I won't be a fool no more

You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

I said it ain't my fault

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And the things you would never do

I won't be a fool no more
