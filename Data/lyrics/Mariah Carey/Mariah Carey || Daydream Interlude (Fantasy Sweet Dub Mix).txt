
So sweet
In my daydreams
And every night you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep, but it's a fantasy
Every night you creep into my dreams
It's so real
In my daydreams
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet

In my daydreams
It seems so real
You touch me
You come into my room
Come to me
But it's just a fantasy
It feels so sweet
But it's just a dream
Oh baby it's just a sweet fantasy

And daydream is all that I can do
I feel raptured over you
In silence I keep it to myself
Come and take me
Don't want nobody else

Take me down
Take me down
And a sweet and sweet
And a sweet so sweet
And a sweet and sweet
And its deeper than reality
It's just a sweet
It's just so sweet

You're like the kiss of life
You're like the kiss of life
Building in the sky
Boy you're just a fantasy
Oh baby, you come into my room
But you're just a fantasy
