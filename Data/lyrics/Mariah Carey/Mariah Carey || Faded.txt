Eh Eh Eh

You're f-a-d-e-d, my love, my love

It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you, but that was then
I can't forget

My heart's hung over but ain't nothing different
I close my eyes, nothing but faded pictures
Of you, of you...

Faded, baby you're faded
Baby you're faded
Faded

You come and you go
You're just an echo
A whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here
So intangible, just like an echo

Still try and pretend it's possible
To bring us back to life
But we continue to subside
Hanging on for life on this roller coaster ride

I call your name, baby, subconsciously
Always somewhere but you're not there for me
Boy you, boy you...

You're faded, baby you're faded
Baby you're faded
Faded (boy you just come and you go)

You come and you go
You're just an echo (just an echo, just an echo)
A whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here
So intangible, just like an echo

Baby, faded
You're always somewhere but you're not there for me
Not there for me, not there for me
You're always somewhere but you're not there for me
Not there for me, not there for me
