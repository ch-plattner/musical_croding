
See it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved

So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

What can I say, I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

And in my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so

Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
(if she hurts you or misleads you) Is call me and let love rush in
(you can just call me baby) 
If you really need me (if you really need me baby)
Baby just reach out and touch me(reach reach baby)
(reach, baby)
You don't ever have to be
(don't ever hesitate to call me)
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you(if she hurts you)
(she's a dam fool)
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
(all you gotta do is call me boy, I got you)

If you really need me (yeah:.)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(if you're listening to me baby)
You don't ever have to be (like you used to)
Downhearted again
(before I even knew you)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(then you know I'm singing to you)
Baby all you ever need to do
(so I just wanted you to know)
Is call me and let love rush in
(that "anytime you need a friend")

If you really need me (I'm here)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(you can still believe
You don't ever have to be in fairy tales)
Downhearted again (yours and mine)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(so if by chance you take a listen)
Baby all you ever need to do
(I'm quite sure you "know is call me and let love rush
In that this one's for you)
(cause I'm giving "my all")
