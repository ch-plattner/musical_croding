[Verse 1:]
Yet another early morning and you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See I, know you see me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me take a breathe (let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you fed up it's over.
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot, baby

[Chorus:]
It's a wrap for you baby (it's A Wrap)
It's a wrap for you boy (it's A Wrap)
Oh, baby

[Verse 2:]
If I ever misrepresented my self-image
Then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent
But I learn my lesson
Boy, you're sorry
Buh buh buh
All out in the open
Go make me go call Maury Povich

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me take a breathe (let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you fed up it's over.
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot, baby

[Chorus:]
It's a wrap for you baby (it's A Wrap)
It's a wrap for you boy (it's A Wrap)
Oh, baby

[Bridge:]
Put all of your shit in the elevator
It's going down like a denominator
Trying to keep holding on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gonna wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain't coming back
It's the Martini I mean it baby
It's wrap

When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong (you're dead wrong)
So just scoo do do doot, baby
Boy I ain't playing a game.
I told you, I told you
If you fed up one more time it's over (it's wrap)
So get out of my face, it's over
Been sitting here all night, leave me alone.
Since one o'clock A.M. been drinking patron
Let the credits role, it's a wrap
