
Once upon a time
We swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us and we changed
Then you sat alone and pried
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way

We went
Round for round
Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

This was a love phenomenon
No one could explain
And I wish I could press reset
And feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
Wanna pause it
But I can't make it stay (Just gotta let it play)

We went
Round for round
Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

No need to call my phone
I changed my number today
And matter fact
I think I'm moving away
Sorry, the frustration's
Got me feeling that way
And I just keep having
One last thing to say

I just wanna hold you
Touch you, Feel you
Be near you, I miss you
Baby baby baby
I'm tired of tryna fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you
(I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U.)
