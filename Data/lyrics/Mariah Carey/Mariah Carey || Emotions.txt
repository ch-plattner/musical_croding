[Chorus:]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]

In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

[Chorus]
