
Baby don't tell me you miss me you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me
Tonight tonight 'cause I've heard it all before

Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore

[Chorus:]
Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby no no no

Baby don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight tonight 'cause I can't take any more

Just turn around
Don't break me down
Baby I don't love you like before

[Chorus]

So hard for me to let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby give me one more chance
I know that we can make amends
Just let me love you one more time
Don't say it
Oh darling gonna lose mind
Don't say it babe

Baby don't tell me you miss me you love me

[Chorus]
