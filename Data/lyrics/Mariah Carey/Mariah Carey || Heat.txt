
That's Mariah... 

Heat, heat, heat 
Heat, heat, heat 
Next time I'm gonna come on harder 
Can't step on this heat Don't Bother 
Next time I'm gonna, next time I'm gonna 
Can't step on this heat Don't Bother 

I see you put your favorite 
Dress on again 
I guess you thought 
That you would stick 
but now you're ready ?
You got your tag tucked in 
Strugglin' 
Tryin to look cute in your 
Best friend's boots 
But they don't hardly fit 
Why you back again 
Tryin' to steal man 
I told you once before 
But you don't know me 

I ain't who you think I'm is 
I will snatch off all this ish 
You think I won't come out of 
These heels and make it clear, ho? 
(I ain't the one) 
You think I won't f*ck up my hair and take it, b*tch? 
Keep your hands off of my boo 
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do 
What makes you think you 
Fly enough to take my man? 
(Not, y'all ain't the one) 

All these J-Ho want what's mine 
But they done lost they minds 
They on him like the ice-cream man 
Night and day 
Why I gotta fight to keep 
'Em all away 
They cryin' but they know 
They can't have none 
Obsessin' but they messin 
With the wrong one 

I ain't who you think I'm is 
I will snatch off all this *ish 
You think I won't come out of 
These heels and make it clear, ho? 
(I ain't the one) 
You think I won't f*ck up my hair and take it, b*tch? 
Keep your hands off my boo 
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do 
What makes you think you 
Fly enough to take my man? 
(No, I ain't the one) 

Next time I'm gonna come on harder 
Can't step on this heat Don't Bother 
(Heat, heat, heat) 
Next time I'm gonna, next time I'm gonna 
Can't step on this heat Don't Bother 
(Heat, heat, heat) 

You think I won't come out of 
These heels and make it clear, ho? 
(I ain't the one) 
You think I won't f*ck up my hair and take it, b*tch? 
Keep your hands off my boo 
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do 
What makes you think you 
Fly enough to take my man? 
(No, I ain't the one) 

Oh, oh oh 
Cause y'all ain't the one
