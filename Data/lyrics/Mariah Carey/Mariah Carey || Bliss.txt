
Touch me baby
It feels so amazing
And you stimulate me
And you make me want you
More and more

What do I do
What do I say
Does it feel good
To you this way
I wanna be
All that you need
Boy what's your fantasy?
Better hold on, ready or not
Baby my love ain't gonna stop
Take it down low
Make me get high

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you

Baby don't you rush me, no
You got to take it slow
Juts ket the feeling grow
Until it overflows
Anyway you want it now
Just gotta tell me how
To give you everything
You've even dared to dream

Isn't it bliss
To you right now
Don't be subdued
Say it out loud
Ain't it a sweet
Luscious delight
When you're immersed in my
Ocean of love

Coming on strong
Baby I've been waiting so long
Revel inside of paradise

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you

So
Gimme some pure delectable love
Like I'm gonna give to you
Keep coming around
'Cause I won't run out
I can't get enough of you
My love goes on

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you

All my love's for you
