You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in thtat sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control

[Chorus:]
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face I go off
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

[Chorus]

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

[Chorus]
