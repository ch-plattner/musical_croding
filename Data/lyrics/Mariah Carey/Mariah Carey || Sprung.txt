Babe, when you look my way 
You keep on blowin' my mind 
You keep on makin' me high 
Keep givin' me butterflies 

Every little thing you do just lifts me off of the ground 
Heart leaps when you come around 
See, I'm just breakin' it down 

You've got everything I need 
Just want you to want me 
You just can't imagine boy 
I'm on a tangent 

Cause I'm sprung over you 
And ain't nothing I can do 
Turning me upside down 
Boy, you got me twisted out 
Thoughts of you fill my head 
Toss and turn in my bed 
Cause I'm sprung over you 
And I don't know, don't know what to do 

Oh, it's hard to make believe 
This's just a casual thing 
You so ? to me 
Feels like I'm leaving a dream 

Baby, please don't wake me up 
I'm lost in reverie 
Drifting (?) 
I'm right where I wanna be 

You got everything I need 
Just want you to want me 
You just can't imagine boy 
I'm on a tangent 

Cause I'm sprung over you 
And ain't nothing I can do 
Turning me upside down 
Boy, you got me twisted out 
Thoughts of you fill my head 
Toss and turn in my bed 
Cause I'm sprung over you 
And I don't know don't know what to do 

I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby 
I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby 

Cause I'm sprung over you 
And ain't nothing I can do 
Turning me upside down 
Boy, you got me twisted out 
Thoughts of you fill my head 
Toss and turn in my bed 
Cause I'm sprung over you 
And I don't know don't know what to do
