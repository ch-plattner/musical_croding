[Verse 1:]
I saw you yesterday, 
And I heard what you had to say, 
All those ugly ways you 
Think about me, yeah. 

But I know it's okay, 
Gonna keep a smile on my face, 
Hate don't change the way 
I feel about my inner being. 

[Refrain:]
'Cause I won't let 'em dim my light, and I'm holding 
My head up high, 
Even though my exterior 
Is not impeccable to me, 

I don't know if my 
Wrongs is right, 
But I'm gonna keep living my life. 

Defame my name, 
And doubt me, 
I don't care what they say 
'bout me. 

[Chorus:]
Imperfect; 
that's all that I'll ever be; 
And god knows that's alright with me, 
'Cause I know there's 
No one greater 
And everybody's imperfect, 
When you tryna live in harmony, but the song of life 
Is out of key; 
Just be perfectly imperfect. 

(Imperfect) [x4]

[Verse 2:]
As I look at the TV screen, 
Internet and magazines, 
So much insecurity surrounds me, 
wish I could change some things, 
gotta steal with my self-esteem, 
Folks so superficial 
Makes it hard to just survive. 

[Refrain:]
'Cause I won't let 'em dim my light, 
and I'm holding my head up high, 
Even though my exterior 
Is not impeccable to you, 
I don't know if my 
Wrongs is right, 
But I'm gonna keep living my life 

Defame my name and doubt me, 
I don't care what they say 
'bout me. 

[Chorus:]
Imperfect; 
That's all that I'll ever be; 
And god knows that's alright with me, 
'Cause I know there's 
No one greater 
And everybody's imperfect, 
When you tryna live in harmony, but the song of life 
Is out of key; 
Just be perfectly imperfect. 

(Imperfect) [x4]

[Bridge:]
I may not walk like a super model, or look as flawless as they do;
I don't know where you get off judging, 
'cause I'm imperfect just like you. 

So I don't care about your status, so I'll swear up to here I've had it; 
Ain't trying to win no beauty pageant, 'cause in my heart is all that matters. 

[Chorus:]
Imperfect; 
That's all that I'll ever be; 
And god knows that's alright with me, 
'Cause I know there's 
No one greater 
And everybody's imperfect, 
When you tryna live in harmony, but the song of life 
Is out of key; 
Just be perfectly imperfect. 

(Imperfect) [x4]

Oh... 

That's all 
That I'll ever be; 
And god knows that's alright with me, 
'Cause I know there's 
No one greater 
And everybody's imperfect, 
When you tryna live in harmony, (tryin', tryin') 
but the song of life Is out of key; (it's alright) 
Just be perfectly imperfect. (Baby, baby, baby!) 

(Imperfect) [x8]
