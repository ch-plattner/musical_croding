[Verse 1:]
I thought I'd be with you but you never tried to holler 
We can spend a couple milli actin silly in Milano 
Boy hit your horn (beep beep), I'll follow 
Have your whip in driveway by tomorrow 
Secretly, I know you want to hit it like the lotto 
And after that, we can ketchup like tomato 
We can make love in Italy in the grotto 
Fresh off the jet, got the men they screaming bravo 

[Chorus:]
Steppin' in my Jimmy Choo's 
Yeah, I got it all cute for you baby 
Nothin' like them other girls 
I would never be rude to you baby 
Can't wait, just say 
That you wanna be more than just friends 
Boy, I'ma love you until the end, the end, the end, the end, the end 
(More Than Just Friends) 
Boy, I'ma love you until the end, the end, the end, the end, the end 
(More Than Just Friends) 
Boy, until the end 

[Verse 2:]
Boy, you got me all mixed up like Cerrato 
You got me spinnin' round for ya like a little model 
Steady feenin for ya like them fries at McDonalds 
I wanna be all on your lips like gelato (ice cream) 
Permanently paint me in your picture like piccasso, 
Love me down till I hit the top of my soprano. 
We can pop bottles while we hittinâ€™ on the (?) 
Then, baby, come and pluck this thing like a cello, cello, cello. 

[Chorus:]
Steppin' in my Chrissy Liu's 
Yeah, I got it all cute for you baby 
Nothin' like them other girls 
I would never be rude to you baby 
Can't wait, just say 
That you wanna be more than just friends 
Boy, I'ma love you until the end, the end, the end, the end, the end 
(More Than Just Friends) 
Boy, I'ma love you until the end, the end, the end, the end, the end 
(More Than Just Friends) 
Boy, until the end 

[Break:]

Is it you, is it me, we should say how we feel for each other. 
Baby boo, I need your touch, never wanted somethin so much, friendship just aint enough, 
I wanna be with you until the end.
