[Verse 1:]
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh 

Here's your standing O 

Boy, you remind 
me of a love that seemed so sublime. 
Your kisses told me oh so many lies 
shades on like I be stuntin' through the night 

But I decided with the eyes 
to keep the world from knowin' what's inside. 
I didn't know oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
I was a show oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 

[Bridge:]
And your words they had no meaning. 
How didn't I forsee this? 
Happiness and congrats. 
Know that 
I pretend I mean it 

[Chorus:]
So cheers, toast, bravo to you. 
Cuz you're the man of the hour. 
I'ma have to send you some flowers 
Ohhhhhh 
Cheers, toast, bravo to you. 
The man of the hour. 
You played the one that loved you the most 
so here's your standing O 
oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
Boy so Heres your standing O 
oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it (so heres your standing O) 

[Verse 2:]
Here's your standing ovation. 
Doctor, I was too patient. 
Even when you wasn't enough, 
I'm the one that taught you how to love. 
And boy I gave you all of me, 
parts of affection you couldn't see. 
As you embrace her in your arms give her "my all" 
give her more than you gave to me. 

When you had nothing I gave. 
When you were weak I made you brave. 
You went and leave me with the scars on my heart, 
it's funny how ya'll forget it sll. 

[Chorus:]
So cheers, toast, bravo to you. 
Cuz you're the man of the hour. 
I'ma have to send you some flowers 
Whooooooa 
Cheers, toast, bravo to you. 
The man of the hour. 
You played the one that loved you the most 
so here's your standing O 
oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
Boy so Heres your standing O 
oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh 
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it (so heres your standing O) 

[Break:]
Round of applause to the 
biggest fool in the world 
give 'em all that you got 
and they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl. 

Round of applause to the 
biggest fool in the world 
give 'em all that you got 
and they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl. 

Standing Ovation 
congradulation 
Damn I was down for it 
gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it. 
Standing Ovation 
congradulation 
Damn I was down for it 
gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it. 

All you did was pound on it, 
gave you my heart 
and all you did was pound on it 
all you did was pound on it
