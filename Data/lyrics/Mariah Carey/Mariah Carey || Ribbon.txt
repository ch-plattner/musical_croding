
It's only been 20 good minutes since I kissed you 
Come back boo, I miss you 
Wish I had 20 million hours to caress you 
And undress you, to be continued 
Boy you, you don't know how it feels when you whisper in my ear 
Boy you, you give my body chills whenever you are near 

And boy I got your lovin' on my mind 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
You got me wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
You got me wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 

Wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 
Wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 

Sometimes we argue and we fight 
But they better know that that's my baby 
You might even think he cute 
But everybody knows that I'm his lady 
Every time you see us, we super fly 
So proud he's by my side 
He knows I'm ride or die 
You don't know how we roll 
Holla at your people 
Boy you, you don't know how it feels when you whisper in my ear 
Boy you, you give my body chills whenever you are near 

And boy I got your lovin' on my mind 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
You got me wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
You got me wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 

Wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 
Wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 

Boy I'm all wrapped up in you 
You make me feel so unloose 
Tell me what I'm suppose to do 
When you're not around 

Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah) 
Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah) 
Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah) 
Oh, baby (Yeah hey) 
Oh, boy you got me, you got me, you got me 

And boy I got your lovin' on my mind 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
You got me wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 
I got your lovin' on my mind 
Wrapped up, packed up 
Ribbon with a bow on it 

Got ribbon with a bow on it baby 
Boy you don't even know the things you do 
I could spend my whole life with you 

I got your lovin' on my mind 
Baby I could spend my life with you 
It's been 20 good minutes since I kissed you 
Come back boo I miss you
