I lay awake sometimes
Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
And lost the will to fight

And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me is languishing
And I'm too frozen to run

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

'Cause, you see
I've got a lot to dream
There's more than this for me

An angel lands with broken wings
He warms me with his eyes
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart
Unravels as he smiles

See I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learn to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know I'm gonna be fine, that's right

'Cause, for real
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me

But I keep goin' 'cause every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

'Cause, you see
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me
