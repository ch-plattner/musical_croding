[Intro:]
I can't wait to H A T E you
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you go
I can't wait to (boy you should know now)
H A T E you! cause right now a need you
Can't wait to make you go

I can't wait to hate you
Make you, pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seem like such a lost cause

Hey baby! I think of you
I want's to be you little baby!
I still love you
Oh, can't wait to hate you
I just can go on
Cause I gave my heart to you

Was a love phenomenon
No one explain
And I wish
I could press reset
I feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
Wanna pause it
But I can't make it stay

We went round for round til'
We knocked love out
Laying in the ring
Not making a sound yeah yeah

And I just wanna hold you
Touch you, feel you be near you
I miss you baby baby baby
I'm tired of tryna fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

[Chorus:]
I can't wait to hate you
Make you, pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seem like such a lost cause

[Rap:]
Oh shawty hate me?
Now longer wants to date me
She said that I'm a lost cost
She even hate my...
Try to keep it real
Everytime she tried to shake me of
I'm Ok!
I'll be good!
Everyday flameon!
H A T E on young juice
But you can't leave the 'ju-man' lone
Everytime I come around
You sneak and try to use your phone
Girl you should know that
Juman ride ride on these chrome
It's ain't jewelry
Dirty pinky
Half million on my home!

Hey baby! I think of you
I want's to be you little baby!
I still love you
Oh, can't wait to hate you
I just can go on
Cause I gave my heart to you

[Chorus]
