"I was like, why you so obsessed with me?"

So, Oh, Oh-O- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
So, Oh, Oh-O- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
So, Oh, Oh-O- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
So, Oh, Oh-O- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
Will the real MC please step to the mic?
MC- You need an MC, place to be.
MC the MC.

All up in the blogs, sayin' we met at the bar,
When I don't even, know who you are.
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up in your car,
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's.
I'm up in the A, you're so so lame,
And no one here, even mentions your name.
It must be the weed, it must be the E,
Cause you be poppin' hood, you get it poppin'.

Ahhh Ohhhh.
Why you so obsessed with me?
Boy I want to know, lyin' that you're sexing me.
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me.
Ohh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress,
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this.

You're delusional, you're delusional,
Boy you're losing your mind.
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know,
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex,
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex.

Ooh Ohh Ohh.
Boy why you so obsessed with me?
So, Oh, Oh-Oh- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
And all the ladies sing,
So, Oh, Oh-Oh- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
All the girls sing.
(Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed.)

You on your job, you hatin' hard,
Ain't goin' feed you, I'mma let you starve.
Graspin' for air, and I'm ventilation,
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'.
Tellin' the world how much you miss me,
But we never were, so why you trippin'?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation,
I'm the, press conference, you're a conversation.

Ahhh Ohhhh.
Why you so obsessed with me?
And boy I want to know, lyin' that you're sexing me.
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me.
Ohh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress,
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this.

You're delusional, you're delusional,
Boy you're losing your mind. (Mind)
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know,
Why you wasting your time? (Mind)
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex,
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex.

Ooh Ohh Ohh.
Boy why you so obsessed with me?
So, Oh, Oh-Oh- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
And all the ladies sing,
So, Oh, Oh-Oh- Oh. So, Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh.
All the girls sing.
(Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed.)

Ahhh Ohhhh.
Why you so obsessed with me? (He's all up in George Foreman).
And boy I want to know, lyin' that you're sexing me. (Lying that you're sexing me.)
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me. (Ay)
Ohh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress, (Ohh)
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this.
(Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this.)
(Fade out)
You're delusional, you're delusional, (He's all up in my George Foreman).
Boy you're losing your mind. (Mind)
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know,
Why you wasting your time? (Mind)
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex,
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex...
