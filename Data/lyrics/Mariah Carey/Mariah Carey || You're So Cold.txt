
Lord only knows
Why I love you so
You're a heartless man
I don't understand
Why you gotta be
Why do you need to be
So cold

[Chorus:]
So cold
How can you be
So cold
So cruel to me
Ice cold
Don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside
You're so cold

You play games with my mind
Cheat and lie time after time
And I know you'll never change
But I just can't break away

I don't know why
I let you treat me the way you do
You're just no good for me
I wish I never fell for you

[Chorus]

So many times
You keep me waiting aound endlessly
You just laugh as I drown in despair
Never a worry, never a care

I don't know why
I let you hurt me the way you do
You've got a spell on me
I'm hopelessly in love with you

[Chorus]

Made of stone
Oh you're wicked to the bone
I give you my heart
You tear me apart
You're like a devil
In disguise

[Chorus]
