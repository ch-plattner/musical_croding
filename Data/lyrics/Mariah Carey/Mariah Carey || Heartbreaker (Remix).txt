[MC:]
Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go 
No no 
I should 
I can't leave you alone 
'Cause your soul is haunting me 
Caught up in the midst of you 
And I cannot resist
At all 

Boy if I do 
The things you want me to 
The way I used to do 
Would you love me baby 
Holding me fellin me 
Is what you know to break my heart 

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Give me some real love,
Need someone to give me some real love,
Need someone to give me some real love,
Need someone to give me some real love

Why
When I met ya that night baby 
I didn't know it wouldn't last 
I give my love to you honey 
Wish I could take it all back 

See I have never met a guy
That was better at telling lies
Should've known you'd break my heart

[Da Brat:]
If Da Brat gave a fuck about a nigger
My heart would be broke
Should have know you were star struck when I left you so
I gave you my heart and you broke it again 
I'm a fool when you smile at me I'm convinced 
I get caught up in you when I just can't resist 
I know you lie to me 
It just drives me nuts 
This one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs 
You set it up impressin me with gifts and rings 
I wish love was dollars cuz money ain't a thing 
Cuz when I think of MC blew the party 
I got a ready to play somebody 
Is that tell me you 
Is that for each member of my crew 
With that I'm gonna heartbreak you 
Now you flat on your back 
You really don't know 
So I'd advise you not to trust me yo 

[Missy Elliot:]
Baby, I'm the real thang 
So what ya got me sweatin you consistantly baby 
Baby, I got the good thing 
So why you makin love to me you crazy baby 

I like the way he used to spank me 
He used to lie me on my back take that
He used to have me in the sac legs back? 
But now he be buggin lately 
Hey boy why you actin stinky 
I keep it stiff like wood baby 
So if you wanna keep a good lady 
You need to stop with all the heart breaking

[MC:]
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
