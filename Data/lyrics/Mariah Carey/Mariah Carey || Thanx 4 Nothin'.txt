Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanx for nothin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playin' a game

I can't even know what to say
I've been hurt I've been played
And I'm so shamed
I can't even cry it's that deep
You just lie and you cheat
Like it's nothin'

See you said that you loved me too
And so I trusted you
But I guess that subconciously I knew
But I didn't wanna face the truth
That I was only being used
And you was just frontin'
Hey boy, thanx for nothin'

I never knew enough about you babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
Cause you were just playin' a game

Nothin' anyone could do to convince me babe
I was livin' in a lie just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanx for nothin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playin' a game

Every day and every night
I stay by the phone
Never go no place so just in case
You call I'll be home
Seems like what I do is
Think about our pseudo romance
While you're somewhere burnin' diesel
In the streets havin' laughs

Somebody say you know what I'm going thru
You been left with nothin' too
Too much you can't count on one hand
Singing 3, 4, 5, 6
7 days a week you're drowning in tears
He was so insincere
Now you're layin' up in bed
Every night singing
Hey boy, thanx for nothin'

I never knew enough about you babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken hearted and shattering
Cause you were just playin' a game
Nothin' anyone could to convince me babe
I was living in a lie just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So thanx for nothin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So thanx for nothin'
