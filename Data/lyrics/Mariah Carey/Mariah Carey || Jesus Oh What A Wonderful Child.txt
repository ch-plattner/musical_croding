[Chorus:]
Jesus, Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly, meek, and mild
New life, new hope, new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King

[Chorus]

He was herald by the angels
Born in a lowly manger
The virgin Mary was His mother
And Joseph was His earthly father
Three wise men came from afar
They were guided by a shining star
To see King Jesus where He lay
In a manger filled with hay

[Chorus]

Oh Jesus
Jesus
Mary's baby
Lamb of God
Heavenly child
Jesus
Jesus
I love Him
Oh Jesus
All mighty God
King of kings
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus
Wonderful, wonderful one
Oh, oh
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Son of God
Oh Jesus
Glory...
To the new born King, yeah...
