
I get shy around you
Don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
'Cause you do something to me
That I can't describe baby

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Boy I'm entangled up in you
These feelings I just can't elude
'Cause you're so captivating
That I inadvertantly

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Said I'm insecure when I'm around you
Don't know what to say or do
Catching feelings boy, in spite of myself
I can't think of nobody else sugar
You're the star of all my dreams
I just wanna be your everything
Boy you know you really got me
Baby yeah

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Said I'm insecure when I'm around you
Don't know what to say or do
Catching feelings boy, in spite of myself
I can't think of nobody else sugar
You're the star of all my dreams
I just wanna be your everything
Boy you know you really got me
Baby
