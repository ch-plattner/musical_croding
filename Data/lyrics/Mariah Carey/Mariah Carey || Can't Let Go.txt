There you are
Holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I
Cherish you right
Don't you know
You were my life

[Chorus:]
Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone

[Chorus]

Do you even realize
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try
To deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

[Chorus]

No I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let you go
Even though I try
I can't let go of something that I need so badly
You're all I know
I can't let go
