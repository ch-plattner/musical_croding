Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life
Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath he said
You gotta get up
You gotta get on
You gotta get down girl
You know you drive me crazy baby
You've got me turning to another man
Called you on the phone
No one's home
Baby why ya leave me all alone
And if it wasn't for the music
I don't know what I'd do 

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far no
Because I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind?
You've got your women all around
All around this town, boy
But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
But when I turned on my radio
I found out all I needed to know
Check it out 

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

Hey listen up to your local DJ
You better hear what he's got to say
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
And if your man gives you trouble
Just you move out on the double
And you don't let it trouble your brain
Cause away goes troubles 
Down the drain
I said away goes troubles
Down the drain 

Last night a DJ saved my life
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix 

[Repeat]
