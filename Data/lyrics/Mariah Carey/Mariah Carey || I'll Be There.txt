You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Chorus:]
I'll be there to comfort you
I'll build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness well it's all I'm after
Just call my name
And I'll be there

I'll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Chorus]

If you should ever find someone new
I know she better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't
Then I'll be there

Don't you know baby
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there

I'll be there baby
You know I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there

Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name
And I'll be there
