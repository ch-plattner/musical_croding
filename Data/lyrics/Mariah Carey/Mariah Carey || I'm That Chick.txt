Like Pac, all eyes on me
That's right you are intrigued,

You know this
What it be,
I'm like the lottery,
Hot Bentley with the keys,
Take me for a ride.

Light in the sky, let's fly high,
Boy I got you caught up inside of my haze,
And you're gonna be gone for days

I'm like that ooo weee,
You're fiendin to blaze up,
And taste me,
Got flavor like ice cream,
'Cause I'm that chick you like.

And you know you need this man,
And you know I got this man,
Gonna be your everything,
I'm that chick you like.

La da da ooh we-ee

I do's it naturally
Hypnotize like Biggie,
But you ain't havin' dreams,
I'm that chick you like.

Nah you ain't seeing things,
Or hallucinating,
I brings that levity,
Take me for a ride.

Light in the sky let's fly high,
Boy I got you caught up inside of my haze,
And you're gonna be gone for days

Boy just relax,
And unwind,
Pull me in and
Breathe, once you do,
There ain't no rules,
It's up to you
Ain't no rules,
It's time.

Just keep on kissin' me,
Hold on and baby we
Could party all night through the night
All right

I'm like that ooo weee,
You're fiendin to blaze up,
And taste me,
Got flavor like ice cream,
'Cause I'm that chick you like.

La da da ooh we-ee

I'm like that uptown haze,
Them real thugs blaze,
We'll touch the sky,
'Cause I'm that chick you like.
