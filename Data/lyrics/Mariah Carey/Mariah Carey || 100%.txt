
I am a dream, just beginning
Truth is I prayed when you'd open my eyes,
And you revealed something to me,
Suddenly I am no longer confined

My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
100 Percent and I ain't stopping til I reach the finish

I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm givin everything I got
I'm a go getter
100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it 100 Percent
So go on put your ones up

If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent

You can only do it if you do it like I did
Cause suffering ain't easy
But if you can turn your wounds into living proof
That you've survived the fight and you no longer defined

My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break thru the door til I get in
Everything that I got Ima give it
100 Percent and I ain't stopping til I reach the finish

I'm a believer not just a dreamer
I'm givin everything I got
I'm a go getter
100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
(Nothing can discourage me)
