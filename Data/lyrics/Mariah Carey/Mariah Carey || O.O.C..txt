Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

Baby, no matter how long it be
We never lose that chemistry
And it's the strongest thing
I've ever experienced
So sorry, what ever happened to empathy
I know you motherfucker feel like we
When you're messin' with the one
True lover that make you O.O.C.

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control baby

Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

Baby, everytime you touch me
Still get that electricity
And after all this time
It don't even make no sense

So s'cusa me, te quiero mucho papi
Je ne sais pas mais c'est la vie
When you're messin' with the one
True lover that make you O.O.C.

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control baby

Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

You're out of control
I'm out of control
Bounce on 'em, just bounce on, come on.

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control baby

Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control baby

Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be.
