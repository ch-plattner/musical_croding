
See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize
(I should be your girl)
but I ain't wastin' no more time
cause I've got to make you mine

[chorus]
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

See I used to be afraid
But now baby I can't wait
I just gotta have your love
And enough's enough's enough

[chorus]
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

[Rap]
