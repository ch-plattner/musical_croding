[Ja Rule]
Yeah, heh

[Mariah (Ja Rule)]
I never (who would've thought baby)
Thought I'd be (missin' you baby)
Without you (I need you baby)
By me (why me?)
I never (who would've thought baby)
Thought I'd be (missin' you baby)
Without you (I need you baby)
By me (why me?)

[Ja Rule]
Love what your body does to me
On me, askin' me, off that ecstasy
Reminiscin' how we used to smoke and freak
Then fall asleep, lockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losin' touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, now

[1 - Mariah]
Baby if we got together again
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You're never gonna let me go baby

Promise I will be by your side
I'll be everything you need to get by
What I broke you know we finally mend (?)
Baby if we got together again

[Nate]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hessitate
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait
And if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby, what would you do?

[Repeat 1]

[2 - Mariah (Ja Rule)]
Baby if we got together again (who would've thought baby)
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend (missin' you baby)
I would love you unconditionally (I need you baby)
You're never gonna let me go baby (why me?)

Promise I will be by your side (who would've thought baby)
I'll be everything you need to get by (missin' you baby)
What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)
Baby if we got together again (why me?)

[Ja Rule]
Why would you wanna go through the pain?
The lovin' another name
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame
We can't even get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit, the flesh is weak
But the game is strong
We go my way, your way baby, we movin' on
It's true, gon' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

[Mariah (Ja Rule)]
I never thought (baby there's nothin' to lose)
Thought I'd be (you know my soul's so cold)
Without you (and my love is pain)
By me (spit it one more time)
I never thought (my baby)
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
By me (no doubt, whoa)

[Repeat 1]
