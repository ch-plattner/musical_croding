
I can't imagine
Looking in someone else's eyes
What we have surpasses
Even paradise

It's hard to fathom
Reaching for someone else's hand
What we share is magic
Heaven had a plan

[Chorus:]
Sent from up above
So much love
In my life
I can't get enough
Of your touch
Feels so right

Unending passion
Somehow the fire never dies
What we share is everlasting
Love without demise

He made it happen
Placed so much joy into our hands
What we dreamed
We finally captured
Heaven took command

[Chorus]
