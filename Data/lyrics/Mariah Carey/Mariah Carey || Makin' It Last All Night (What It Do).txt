Got me fly and sexy
Something in you gets me
So tingley inside
Visions of us in the cut tonite
And I find you so appealing
Definitely feeling you...
If you didn't know
Boy you're the secret I've never told

Betch think I'm teasin'
But I ain't got no reason
To deny
The way I feel inside, tonight
I just want to touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like I want you
Over and over and over and over again

What it look like
Me and you making last all night
What it do (what it do)
My heart is beating faster all the time
What it look like
Boy you don't even know everything that flows through my mind
What it do (what it do)
Ooh, boy what you gonna do about it

[JD Rap:]
Listen I got stacks like
The international house of pancakes
Your man great, got more Rovers then a Land makes
I make hits and i don't care about your damn hates
Can't stop doing it , i just do it for the fans sake
You know this man take trips to japan
Tell him to try to run out away
What would I land on
'05's my year
'06 ain't stoppin'
You woke up again and your chart I'm toppin'

Thats how i do it
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freakin' you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freakin' you

Tonight, I need your body (i need your body baby)
Tonight, you got my time (every little second of my time)
Tonight, you won't be sorry (no you won't be sorry baby)
Tonight, you gon' be mine
(C'mon)

Betch think I'm teasin'
But I ain't got no reason
To deny
The way I feel inside, tonight
I just want to touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like I want you
Over and over and over and over again

What it look like
Me and you making last all night
What it do
My heart is beating faster all the time
What it look like
Boy you don't even know everything that goes through my mind
What it do
Ooh, boy what you gonna do about it

What it look like
Me and you making last all night
What it do
My heart is beating faster all the time
What it look like
Boy you don't even know everything that goes through my mind
What it do
Ooh, boy what you gonna do about it
