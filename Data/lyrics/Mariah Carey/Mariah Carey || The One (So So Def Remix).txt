Uh, uh, uh, uh, So, So, Def

[Mariah (JD):]
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love (come on)
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad, cause I know that you're the one (M-C)

[Mariah (JD):]
I'm going through a situation that I can't help (yeah)
Wanna get a little closer but I promised myself (haha)
That I would never give my heart away again babe, baby, baby, baby (ok)
See, I know it's hard but you gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the ish that you get when you have it
Ain't worth it, I've been there so many times (yeah)
I should know better but I (aha)
Can't stop what I feel when you're next to me
I really think I

[JD:] Now how you gon' tell me that I'm not the one
[Mariah:] Baby I need to be sure before I give you my love
[JD:] But you'll never know until you give me a chance
[Mariah:] But there's a lot of things about me I don't think you understand
See I've been cheated on
[JD:] Baby I have too
[Mariah:] And I've been treated wrong
[JD:] I know what you've been through
See I've been there, done that, back again, aha
And all I'm looking for is my special friend
[Mariah:] But I've been lied to and cried to some cold lonely nights
[JD:] I've been played and betrayed and this [?] ain't right, tell me what you wanna do
[Mariah:] Baby I'm just so confused, cos this time it might be true
That baby you're the one

[JD:]
Come on, M-C

[Mariah (JD):]
See the problem with relationships
In general, is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I know everyone out there can relate
So the question is (what)
One, do I really wanna trust this feeling (aha)
Two, do I wanna let it pass me by
Three, do you think it's only superficial
Four, could it actually be different this time
Someone to love me (come on)
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

[Bone Crusher (JD):]
It's just me and you, baby
You're just so sexy and you're driving me crazy
You smell so good, I wish you would
Meet me in the streets, we can tour the hood
And I'll show you all this heaven sent loving is good
And the feeling loving the greatest wood
If it's love that you looking for, baby it's me
The vanglorious man B-C
Cos I love to love you baby
And miss Mariah love me baby (yeah)
It's me and you against the world
I'll protect you baby girl (I like this)
This connection, made in heaven (aha)
Everyday I count my blessings
It's never enough I need second helpings
[?] heaven sent this
Cos I'm here for you baby
