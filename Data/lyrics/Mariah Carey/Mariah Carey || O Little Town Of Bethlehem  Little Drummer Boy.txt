Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum

Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum

Oh, little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless
Sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years 
Are met in thee tonight

Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Then he smiled at me

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep
The angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
Oh, morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing
To God the King
And peace to men on Earth

[Adlib:]
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
And then he smiled at me
Let the whole world sing
