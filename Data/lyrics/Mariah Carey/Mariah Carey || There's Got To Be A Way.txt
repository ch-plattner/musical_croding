
A broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other
Isn't there enough to share

[Chorus:]
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change

In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we accept each other
Can't we make ourselves aware

[Chorus]

And maybe then the future will be a time
Without war, destitution, and sorrow
And hungry children won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just love each other
Isn't there enough to share

[Chorus]
