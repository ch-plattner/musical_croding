Won't you talk to me
This is so out of hand
Out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned

Won't you look at me
You're avoiding my gaze
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways

[Chorus:]
It isn't fair
It isn't right
If it's really gone
Then tell me tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Let me go

Won't you speak to me
I'm just here holding on
'Cause baby I really don't need to wait around
If the feeling is gone

[Chorus]

I don't need no apologies
I'm not looking for no sympathy
All I'm asking for
Is for your honesty
Won't you give it to me
Give it to me now

It isn't fair
It just isn't right
'Cause if it's really gone
You've got to say the word tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Baby if it's over
Won't you let me know
Baby if it's over
If it's over
Over - let me go
