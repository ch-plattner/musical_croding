You're with me
Till the bitter end
What we had transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Till my heart can mend
And be brave enough
To love again

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays reserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

Oh, never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember

Love
(You're never too far away)

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
And There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away, yes

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
Cause you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Oh
See lord knows (lord knows)
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't you let anyone
Tear them away
(You've got to, you've got to)
(You've got to, you've got to)
You've got to hold on
And there will be tomorrow
And in time you'll find the way
(You'll find the way)
Then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And then you cast your fears aside
Because you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And then you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you

(Love)
Nobody can take your place (ah)
Never too far
