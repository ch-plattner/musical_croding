Tryin' make it through the pain
Yet, we intentionally hurt each other
Playing silly games

But when it comes down to win or lose
Don't give up the fight
Cause strength is what we need
And love can save our lives

Bring it on home
You can bring it home
Bring it on home
I know we gon' bring it home

So when your down and frustrated
Let em all keep debating
Because we gon win
And everybody be prepared to do the best that you can
do cause I know we goin in

Bring it on home (bring it on, bring it on home)
You can bring it home
Bring it on home (yeah, yeah)

I know we gon bring it home

Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it on home
Cause we gon, we gon, we gon, we gon, we gon
We going in

Everybody say yeah, yeah
Go to bring it home
Yeah yeah
I know we can bring it home

We gonna, we gonna, we gonna win
Go on and bring it home
We going, we going, we goin win
Go on and bring it home

Bring it on home
You can bring it home
Bring it on home
I know we gon' bring it home

(Come on everybody....)

Bring it on home
You can bring it home
Bring it on home
I know we gon' bring it home
