Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

It was a summer's day
You went walking by
She didn't notice as you turned
And you discreetly winked your eye
And I remembered you
From back in the day
You were the boy I couldn't breath without
The one that got away

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Now that I found you
How can I let you go
You know I got my man at home
But baby, I still need ya so
And I know you ain't
Never leaving that girl
But everytime you touch me, baby
It feels so incredible

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Secret lovers

You and me, you and me, you and me, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby¡¡¡
