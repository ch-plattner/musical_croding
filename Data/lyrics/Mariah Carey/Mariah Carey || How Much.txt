MC
Uh baby I don't think you know
Just yes
How much I love you
Have you ever felt lonely
When you know you gotta leave me
That's
How much I love you
Oh baby I don't think you know
Just yes
How much I love you
([U:] Na na na)
Have you ever felt lonely
([U:] Yeah)
When you know you gotta leave me
That's
How much I love you

[MC:]
The way I feel for you
I can't describe
[U:]
It's almost too intense
To verbalize
[MC:]
Essentially you're all
I'm living for
(And) basic'lly each day
I need you more
(And more)

[both:]
Have you ever been so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you

Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
(The end)
Just me and my boyfriend

[MC:]
Don't underestimate the love in me
(U: Da da da da)
It's obvious these feelings run so deep
I fall and fall for you day after day
(U: Da da da da)
Nobody else could ever take your place

[both:]
Have you ever felt so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
([MC & U:] Da da da da)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you

Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

You don't gotta waste your time and worry
(I dont waste your time)
You don't gotta look for reassurance
(Look around)
'Cause clearly you're the only one that's getting this and
(Sugar)
Sugar I don't need nobody else
But you
And honey I ain't letting go too soon
Because I can't get enough
Why you asking how much?
It's more than you can handle baby

Have you ever felt so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(I love you baby)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you
(I love you baby)

Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

Have you ever felt so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you

Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

Have you ever felt so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you

Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
