Here comes Santa Claus 
Right down Santa Claus Lane 
Vixen and Blitzen, and all his reindeer 
Pulling on the reins. 
Bells are ringing, children singing, 
All is merry and bright. 
Hang your stockings with Christmas cheer, 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. 

Oh ho ho 
Who would I go 
Oh ho ho 
Who would I go 
Up on a house top 
Click click click 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. 

So gather 'round 
Gather 'round 
Until night becomes the day 
Gather 'round, gather 'round 
We're gonna have a good time and celebrate
