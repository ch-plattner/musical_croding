
Baby I know this, know this, know this
Aint gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
Aint gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss

Feel so empty inside
Since our last kiss goodbye
Picture you in my mind 
And I can't seem to rationalize
The way we let it end
It just don't make no sense 
This can't be happening
I need you back again

Everybody asking questions
Like we're some kind of obsession
For the millionth time asking I'm like
"Uhh let it rest"
Can i get a minute to breathe
They're like "Nope, 
What's up with you and so-so?"

But in my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me

Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still
Somethin' somethin'
Oh this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

Ooh you said you'd never leave me
So I'll keep believing
That eventually
We gon' kiss away the hurt
Do it like it were
And wake up how we used to be

Never let it go, get it right
Bring it back home, stay for life
Call it what you want, it's in your eyes
We gon' make it thru this i'll prove it
Somethin' bout our love 
Will not fade away
Always everlasting and

In my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me

Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still
Somethin' somethin'
Oh this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

Baby I know this, know this, know this
Aint gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
Aint gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss

In my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me

Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still
Somethin' somethin'
Oh this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss
