
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye 
O come ye to Bethlehem
O come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

And He shall reign forever and ever
And He shall reign forever and ever
For the Lord God, King of kings, reigneth
Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

O Sing 
Choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing Hallelujah
Heaven above
Glory to God
In the Highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

And He shall reign forever and ever
And He shall reign forever and ever
