
I'm over here
Looking at you
You're over there
Watching me too
Both painting pictures of
Of how we'll kiss and f***

So what we gonna do
(So what ya gonna do? What ya gonna do)
Tell me why we're standing here
The moment's passion's all so clear
You've got my mind blown
And baby, I'm ready to go

But uh
If it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

(Let's make it)
Hot as you can stand it
Something like volcanic
You know it seems organic
Just like the stars and planets
Yeah, we are
So what you gonna do
(So what ya gonna do? What ya gonna do)

Tell me why we're still in here
There's nothing for us to fear
I could tell with my eyes closed
Now baby, I'm ready to go

But uh
If it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

If it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me, baby
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

[Snoop Dogg:]
Everytime I fall though
Want me to speak on the word or two
It's the D-O-double-G
And I do it so lovingly
Diggin' this track by the Neptunes
Babygirl, follow me to the rest room
Now get buck wild
Shhh, don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go round and round
Do you want me to
Don't say you won't
I know you do
Most girls play shy
It won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow-wow

But uh
If it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

If it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me
