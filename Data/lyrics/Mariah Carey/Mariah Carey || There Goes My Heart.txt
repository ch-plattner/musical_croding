
You know me well,we go too far back
How could anyone else compete with that
So I just can't help feelin' sentimental
'Bout this in our past

We promised to keep it casual
But at times it can be so difficult
This relationship, so untypical
And I can't understand
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love ma and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

[Chorus:]
There goes my heart again
Baby why can't we be just friends
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

When I fell you stare catching me off-guard
Boy it's just not fair, 'cause you know for sure
How to lure me in with that magnetic smile
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

[Chorus]

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try so very hard not to bend

There goes my heart again (There goes,there goes baby)
There goes my heart again (No, no, no)
There goes my heart again (There goes baby)
There goes my heart again (There goes)
There goes my heart again (First you love me then you leave me baby)
There goes my heart again (I try to keep it causal)
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again

One, two, three, four, five, six, seventh heaven
