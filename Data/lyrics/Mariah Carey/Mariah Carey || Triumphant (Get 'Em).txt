Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

They told me get 'em, I got 'em,
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I ain't never asked for no handouts
You won't carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they ain't mad at me,
I'm on fire and I'm gon' burn
And they ain't gon' learn,
I remember they said that it ain't my turn
But it ain't confirmed, then the table's turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I ain't gon' stop, 'cause I'm gon' climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Path that I choose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell tryin' to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it's hundreds and millions, this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the born achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby still know who you are
So you gotta keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the rope
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
(Get 'em, get 'em, get em)
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
(Stay on your toes)
Don't let 'em ever count you out
(No, no, no, no)
(Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em go)
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

They told me get 'em, I got em
They told me get 'em, I got em
They told me get 'em, I got em
They told me get 'em, I got em
They told me get 'em, I got em
They told me get 'em, I got em
