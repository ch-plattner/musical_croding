[Chorus:]
So far so far you're slipping away away
Slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby I'm so afraid
So far so far you're slipping away away
Slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

I keep on reaching and I
I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me baby

I keep on yearning and I
I guress I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes

[Chorus]

I keep denying that our
Our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play

I can't remember when you
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
Your silence chills me to the bone

[Chorus]

Away away away away away
Further further
You're so far

Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be
Baby you're slipping away from me

So far so far slipping away away
Slipping away from what we had
I tell you I just don't understand
You're so far
So far so far slipping away away
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading so fast
It seems you know you're slipping away from me

Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be
Baby you're slipping away from me
