
Don't be afraid to fly
Spread your wings
Open up a door
So much more inside

Don't
Be afraid to fly
Come spread your wings and just fly with me and you'll see why
It's alright to
Fly
Fly
Just fly
Just fly
Don't be afraid
Don't let your spirit die
Just

[Chorus (repeat):]
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to fly
Fly
So much more inside
Come spread your wings and just flutter right into the sun

Don't be afraid to fly
Don't be afraid to just fly
You
You have become a butterfly
Don't be afraid to just fly
(Spread your wings)
Prepare to fly

Butterflies
Are free to fly
Fly away
Bye bye
Butterflies
(You have become a butterfly)
Are free to fly
Fly away
Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye bye
Butterflies
Are free to fly
Bye bye

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
(Spread your wings and fly)
For you have become a butterfly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Bye bye
Fly away
Fly
Bye bye
Fly away
Fly
Butterfly
