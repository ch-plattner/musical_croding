Today a child is born on earth
Today a child is born on earth
Today the glory of God
Shines everywhere
For all the world

[Chorus:]
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is our light and salvation
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations

Behold the Lamb of God has come
Behold the Lamb of God has come
Behold the Savior is born
Sing of His love
To everyone

[Chorus]

Today our hearts rejoice in him
Today our hearts rejoice in him
Today the light of His birth
Fills us with hope
And brings peace on earth

[Chorus]

Today a child is born on earth
Today a child is born on earth

He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day
