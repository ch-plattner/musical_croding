
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

[Verse 1]
I'm riding home in pain again baby
But that don't mean s*** to you
You're currently engaged
In an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say "players only love you
when they're playing games"
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away
Like my friends all told me to

[Chorus]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

[Verse 2]
See I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high
When he goes down low
But see it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherf***** does
Is this just an impossible dream baby
To elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

[Chorus]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

[Twista]
Now you know roll a beemer and a benz 
When I'm dishin out ends
Why you trppin on a player baller
Havin good conversation while we rollin on 2-4's
And I know you got doubts 
But why you listenin to what people talkin bout 
You ain figured out why they call ya 
The hefas steady hatin cause you rollin on 2-4's
See how yo money flo 
You dressed in designer clothes from head to ya toe 
You ain't satisfied well tell me what you lookin for 
(I'm lookin for my one and only) 
Well I'll be yo one and only if you give me a chance 
I'll make a change for you girl 
I know I ain been the mos faithful n**** in the world 
But lets stay togetha so we can shine like pearls 
Spit it to her while I fill her got her hot like fire 
To kiss yo lips I desire 
Twis and Mariah togetha like them grips on ya tires 
(Lookin for my one and only) 
Well come here shawty well let me make it better 
We can do whateva while we sittin on sued and leather 
Flickin through the city while we ridin on chrome 
Lets kick it in the Chi 
I know I messed up wit you an i ain gon lie 
I know you was feelin you really know yo guy 
But baby girl I ain't mean to blow yo high 
Let me pick the pieces up and but um back togetha 
Cause I wanna be wit you don't wanna leave you lonely 
Ride wit you like a hommie neva no fony

Every time--oh-mmm
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so loney
Why--

Every time I turn around
Agh--ha ha ha ha

Whey can't I find my one and only
Still lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
