
Baby, I had enough of danger
And people on the street
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go

'Cause teacher,
There are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made my cry
So I don't wanna learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For a love, tell boy,
Who's teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me NO
So you think that you love me, NO
That you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher,
There are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made my cry
So I don't wanna learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For a uptown boy,
Who's teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Who is that teacher
I'm the student
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy I'm just gonna say
You are my teacher
You are my leader

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong
You're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher,
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have
Is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Cause it ain't no joy
Just uptown boy,
Who's just isnt willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just want one more try
