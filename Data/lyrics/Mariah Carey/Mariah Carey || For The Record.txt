
For the record
You oughta know
You wasn't thinking
When you let me go

But whatever
That's how it goes
Win some you lose some
And others you hold in your heart

Why it gets so hard
Tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go
No, no, no

Suddenly you're here
And it's so surreal
And I don't know
What the deal

Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Them other irregularities
They can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me

People see ya know
Asking all about
Me and how they always thought we
Were so perfect together

Let's re-write the end
Start over again
And it's gon go better now

Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

For the record
You'll always be a part of me
No matter what you do
And for the record
Can't nobody say
I didn't give my all to you

And for the record
I told you underneath the stars
That you belong to me
For the record
It's obvious that
We just can't let go of us, honey

Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

For the record, baby
Now you know, baby
