[Intro:]
Mine (ma-ine)
Mine
Mine (you're ma-ine)
Mine

[Pre-Chorus:]
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself dying for your touch
Spring time eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Chorus:]
You make me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Post-Chorus:]
I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine (baby you're mine)
I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine

Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want you badly
Wanted to let you have me

Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crushed me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly
Now I'm lying here falling apart

[Pre-Chorus:]
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself dying for your touch
Spring time eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're Mine

[Chorus:]
Boy you make me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby we were the best
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine

I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine (baby you're mine)
I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine

[Bridge:]
Oh
You make me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that
My baby we were the best
I suffer in dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to
Give you up
You're mine

[Post-Chorus:]
I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine
I can't seem to give you up
You're Mine
