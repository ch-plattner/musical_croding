
Reflections of your love 
Have come to wither 
I thought I'd done my best to memorize 
A picture fades of you and I together 
I haven't come to terms 
With how we said goodbye 

Did you really care
Care at all for me
Did you really care
Did you care at all for me

A displaced little girl 
Wept years in silence 
And whispered wishes you'd materialize 
She pressed on night and day 
To keep on living 
And tried to many ways 
To keep her soul alive 

Did you really care 
Care enough for me 
Did you really care 
Did you care at all for me 

If I'm not quite good enough 
Or somehow undeserving of 
A mother's love 

You could have had the decency 
To give me up 
Before you gave me life 

Don't you even care 
Just the slightest bit for me 
Cause I really need to feel you cared 
Even once upon a time for me 
I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me 
I need to understand 
Why you left me there so helplessly 

Don't you even care 
Care at all for me 

Reflections of your love 
Have come to wither 
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
