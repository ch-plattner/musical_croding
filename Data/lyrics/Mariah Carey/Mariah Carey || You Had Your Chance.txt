
Well it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

Where were you when I needed you most
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance
