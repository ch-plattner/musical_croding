
See I'm going through a situation
That I can't help
Wanna get a little closer
But I promised myself
That I would never give my heart
Away again
Oo oo babe, I know it's hard
Butcha gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get
When you have it
Ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel
When you're next to me
I really think I

Finally found somebody
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

(Baby you're the one)
(Baby you're the one)

See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do
Anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I, know everyone out there can relate
So the question is
One: do I really wanna trust this feeling
Two: do I wanna let it pass me by
Three: do you think it's only superficial
Four: could it actually be different this time
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

Finally found somebody (The only one)
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love (No, no)
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (I just don't wanna be hurt)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(But boy I think you might be the one)
Finally found somebody
That could be the one (Maybe I've found)
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (Boy I'm so afraid)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
('Cause I know you're the one)

Oh baby
Sweet darling
I
I think I finally found

Finally found somebody (The only one)
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (No)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
(I don't wanna be hurt anymore)
This is bad 'cause I know that you're the one
(But I think you might really be the one)
Finally found somebody
Could be the one, but I promised myself (Finally found)
That I wouldn't give in to love
(I promised myself not to give in)
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
This is bad
(Anymore this is bad)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
('Cause I know that you're the one)
Finally found somebody
Could be the one
(I finally found somebody that could be the one)
But I promised myself
(But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love)
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
(And I'm scared)
And I'm nervous
(And I'm nervous)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Please, please baby baby)
