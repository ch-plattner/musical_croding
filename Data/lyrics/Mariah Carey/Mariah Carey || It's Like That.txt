[Jermaine Dupri:]
Dis is, the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
Da da da da, I like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
Like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all) MC

[Mariah Carey:]

[Verse 1:]
I came to have a party
Open off the Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watchin me
So what's it gonna be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feelin me

[Bridge:]
Cuz it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just makin the most of life

[Chorus:]
Everybody is livin it up (Uh)
All the fellas keep lookin' at us (cuz)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)

[Verse 2:]
You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it
Let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me

[Bridge:]
Cuz it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
Just makin the most of life

[Chorus:]
Everybody is livin it up (Uh)
All the fellas keep lookin at us (cuz)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)

[Bridge:]
Cuz it's my night (it's my, it's my night)
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
Baby, I'm making the most of life

[Chorus:]
Everybody is livin it up (I said everybody)
All the fellas keep lookin at us (lookin at us)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all), that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that y'all (that y'all)

This is my night
