[SDD:]
Yo 
What's happenin'?
What you're cryin' for?
You know you look too damn good to be cryin'
Come here
([MC:] Do do do do do yeah yeah)
How about a player
DPG style
You know
You know

[MC:]
When I think of our untimely end 
And everything we could have been 
I cry, baby I cry

Ok
So it's 5 AM and 
I still can't sleep 
Took some medicine 
But it's not working 
Someone's clinging to me 
And it's bittersweet 
'Cause he's head over heels 
But it ain't that deep 
I finally changed my number 
Got a different pager 
Then last saturday 
Your cousin called to say you're 
Tryin' to reach me 
Probably because you see that 
I'm with someone new 

Late at night like a little child 
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home 
On my tippy toes 
So that he won't know 
(So that he won't know)
I still cry baby 
(I cry baby)
Over you and me

Sipping Bailey's Cream 
By the stereo 
Trying to find relief 
On the radio 
I'm suppressing the tears 
But they start to flow 
'Cause the next song I hear 
Is a song I wrote 
When we first got together 
Early that september 
I can't bear to listen 
So I might as well drift 
In the kitchen 
Pour another glass or two 
And I try to forget you 
(You)

Late at night like a little child 
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
(In my new friend's home on my)
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
(So that he won't know I)
I still cry baby 
Over you and me
(You and me)

[SDD:]
Baby hear me when I say
Let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time 
And worry how he handle thangz
(That ain't right) baby hear me when I say 
A playa feelin' good today (u know ur 2 fly 2 be cryin')
Don't even waste your time watch how I handle (watch) thangz
Man ur a fool for this
([MC:] For this)
But on the real dog I'm cool with this we do and this
[MC & SDD:]
D-O-DOUBLE G-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry!

[MC:]
(It's late)
Late at night like a little child
(I'm like a little child)
Wandering around alone
(Wandering around alone)
In my new friend's home
(Do do do do do)
On my tippy toes
(Tippy toes)
So that he won't know 
(So that he won't know)
I still cry baby
(I was babbling)
Over you and me
(Over you and me)

Why is it 5 AM and
I'm still struggeling and
Walking 'round no
Do do do do do do do

(On my tippy toes)
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know 
I still cry baby 
(I still cry)
Over you and me

I don't get no sleep
I'm half awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfectly

I cry
I cry
I cry
Oh
I gotta give me some sleep
Cry
Cry
Cry
Cry
Baby and I
Cry
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know 
I still cry
You and I
Over you and me

Late at night like a little child
(Oh like a little child)
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
(Do do do do do)
(In my new friend's home)
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
(So that he won't know)
I still cry
(Do do do do do)
(Do do do do do)
(Do do do do do)
(Do do do do do)
(Do do do do do)

I
Cry
Cry
Cry
Cry

Late at night like a little child 
Wandering around alone 
In my new friend's home 
On my tippy toes 
So that he won't know 
I still cry baby 
Over you and me

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Cry baby 
On my tippy toes 
So that he won't know 
I still cry
Mmmh
Baby and I
