
We were two little people wrapped up in this big ol' world
Drifting 'round in space out of place, just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart and saw all my dreams come true

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love you like summertime, love you cherry wine
Love you like free money, like a preacher loves Sunday
Love you like a freeze pop, love you like a milkshake
Love you like a high school girl on a first date

Love you like shooting stars, love you like a muscle car
Love you like were destined
Love you like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible, yeah

Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door, I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird I'mma hum those three words
I love you, I love you, I love you

Freeze the time, let the world go by
If your mine say you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy, take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love you like sunsets, bubble baths on the jet
Love you like Kool Aid, Louis Millionaire shades
Love you like Sugar Daddies, love like a pimp caddy
Love like a holiday, Duncan Hines, yellow cake

Love you like it's 5 am and I'm off work
Love you like Louboutin heels and a miniskirt
Love you like an Asscher cut pink and white engagement ring
Love you like laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci

And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci

And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci
Forever your lady
Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci

And I'm forever your lady
Oh, you did the impossible
I'd almost given up, the impossible
