Eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh 
Na na na na 

[Verse 1:]
I thought we had something special 
We had something good 
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood 
If you see me walking by you 
Boy don't you even speak 
Pretend you on the sofa 
And I'm on the TV 
Might see me on a poster 
See me at a show 
But you won't see me for free 
Boy this ain't no promo 

[Bridge:]
No shame now 
Where ever you be laying you can stay now 
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down 
On the plane now 
And don't keep calling from your mama's house 

[Chorus:]
When I break I break 
Boy up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break, uh 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break 

You ain't never gunna feel this thing again 
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I see seen all your friends 
I break 
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad 
Take a look at my bags baby 
I break 

I don't crack no 
I shatter 

[Verse 2:]
So look who's crying now 
Boohoo hoo 
Talking about your missing your 
Booooo ooo 
And no you and getting it 
I know you ain't hittin' it 
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spitting it 

Ah ha ah ah ah ah 
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me 
I'm going bye bye bye ye ye 
So pay the consequences because you acted all ignorant... 

[Bridge:]
No shame now 
Where ever you be laying you can stay now 
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down 
On the plane now 
And don't keep calling from your mama's house 

[Chorus:]
When I break I break 
Boy up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
When I break I break 

You ain't never gunna feel this thing again 
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I see seen all your friends 
I break 
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad 
Take a look at my bags baby 
When I break I break I break 

[Breakdown:]
And no super glue can fix this shit 
When I break I break I break 
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break I break I break 
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic 
Can fix this when I break, I break 
If we were two Lego blocks 
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 
Couldn't put us back together again 

[Chorus:]
When I break 
Boy up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break, uh 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break 

You ain't never gunna feel this thing again 
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I see seen all your friends 
I break 
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad 
Take a look at my bags baby 
I break 

When I break I break 
Boy up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break, uh 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face boy 
Up out my face 
I break
