Whoaaa

They can say, 
Anything they want to say,
Try to bring me down,
But I will not allow anyone to succeed hanging clouds over me,
And they can try 
How to make me feel that I, 
Don't matter at all,
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or loose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's, 
There's a light in me,
That shines brightly,
They can try, 
But they can't take that away from me
From me

No no nooo

Oh they, 
They can do
Anything they want to you, 
If you let them in,
But they won't ever win,
If you cling to you pride, and just push them aside,
See I, 
I have learned,
There's an inner peace I own,
Something in my soul that they can not possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

'Cause there's, 
There's light in me me, 
That shines brightly, yes
They can try,
But they can't take that away from me

No oh oh,
They can't take this 
Precious love I'll always have inside me,
Certainly the Lord will guide me where I need to go

Woah, woah
They can say 
Anything they want to say,
Try to bring me down, 
But I won't face the ground,
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach,
Although they do try,
How to make me feel that I,
Don't matter at all,
But I refuse to fall,
Tell me what I believe or loose faith in my dreams,
'Cause there's a light in me,
That shines brightly yes

They can try but they can't take that away from 
Me
From me
No no nooo
Me
