La da do do do
Yeah eh eh eh

On amends
Touch good morning
I was gone
Game over
Not too tight
A fitting moment
Back at me
Far from solace
So I left the bitterness behind
All that sadness and distress of mine
And we found ourselves out spending (yeah)
Hovering above the roof laying over (laying over)

Jump bumpin
Wanna play
Skydiving
You had me
But ain't no intimacy

This single
Won't nothing
Eternal
Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is highly skydiving

You got me lifted baby
Our love is highly skydiving

So they say you got some chick
That keeps you warm at night, along for the ride but
If you ask me that's bullshit
Because obviously heaven sent you for me
See they never told me about love or life
But I'm learning each moment we fly
We were laying as though no consequence
We're in tenderness beyond intense
