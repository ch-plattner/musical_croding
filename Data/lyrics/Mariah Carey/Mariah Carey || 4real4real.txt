Its for real, for real
For real, for real
For real, for real
(turn me up)
For real, for real, for real, for real
Its for real, for real (Oh Uhh)

Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real

Sometimes you be blowin' my mind
If you wont mind, I'll take my time with you
But on the low I'm shy,
Though I front like I'm so next level fly
With them other guys

I really wanna reach out and touch you
If you could only realize how much I like you
Come up knocking at your door,
Give a girl a heave-hoe
And give a demonstration of what it's like

Man it's for real, for real
A 100% for real, Hotter then cable TV
Like something out of your dreams
It's for real, for real a million % the deal
So I'll just keep it to me, and eventually you'll see
I'm for real, for real.

Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby I'm for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby I'm for real, for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby it's for real, for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real

Oh! my friends say I'm waisting my time on you
Tryin' to spurway with screams
Wanna make ya less then ya seem
But I'm not that one, to listen to dumb chicks
That wanna be, were I'm gonna be (yeah)

Baby I wanna reach out and just touch you
If you could only realize how much I like you
Lay my self right next to you
Fall asleep watching cartoons
And wake you up with something good
Cause it's so sweet.

Man it's for real, for real
A 100% for real, Hotter then cable TV
Like something out of your dreams
It's for real, for real a million % the deal
So I'll just keep it to me, and eventually you'll see
I'm for real, for real.

Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby I'm for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby I'm for real, for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby it's for real, for real)
Baby it's, Baby it's for real, for real, for real
