Friends tell me I am crazy
And that I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
But that's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me

[Chorus:]
People always talk about reputation
I don't care about the other girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you're a user
But I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me

And you may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me

[Chorus]

Just be good to me
Just be good to me in the morning
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening
Be good to me

I'm not the jealous type
I won't tie you down in the evening
I'll be around
I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
And we'll be together
Be together

Just be good to me
Just be good to me in the morning
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening
Be good to me

Be nice to me
Be sweet to me
Just be good to me
