
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
And oh baby you know, all that love-making we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B. was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care say "yeah, yeah, yeah"
Sing it like they used to do
This one's for me and you, oh

[Chorus:]
La-di-la-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know, make love
That's how you do it
Just like we did it back then
And this is dedicated to you

I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that love-making we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
And all your friends from way back then
Tell me can you visualize
36 chambers high
Feels like we're there, yeah yeah yeah
The remix of a fantasy, I hear 'em singing back to me

[Chorus]

[Nas:]
Nah, we don't wish today's game was old again
We just wish it wasn't full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Who's the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
'87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do doo-wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Money Earnin' Mt Vernon
Let's go

[Chorus]

Oh baby you know
Dedicated to you
Dedicated to you
Dedicated to you
[6x]
