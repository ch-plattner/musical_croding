You make the beat go
You make the beat
You make the beat go

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout I love you

Got me lost in the clouds
Slowly, keep me here always
You’re the only thing that’s true

Beautiful as the sun
Shadows of my new baby

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout I love you

Baby, communicate without saying a word
Heavenly, it’s more than a state of mind
Now that you’re in my life
And you…

Beautiful as you lay
All my tears dissipate, cause

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout I love you

You make the beat
You make the beat go

Beautiful as you lay
All my tears dissipate

Cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout I love you

You make the beat
You make the beat go
On and on and on and on
