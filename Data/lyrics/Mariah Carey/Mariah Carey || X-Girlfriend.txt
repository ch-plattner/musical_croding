Whoa
Nooo
No no

X-girlfriend you can't have him
It's about time
That you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go
X-girlfriend you don't listen
(X-girlfriend)
Stop trying
He's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go

Hey x-girlfriend
It's too bad when you had him
Y'all thing didn't work
But he's all mine now
So stop pursuing him
Before you get your feelings hurt
See our love is hot
And no, it won't stop
'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you
It don't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep trying
To get wit him

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I anwser I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again

X-girlfriend you can't have him
It's about time
That you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go
X-girlfriend you don't listen
(X-girlfriend)
Stop trying
He's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go

Hey x-girlfriend
Whatever your name is
I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do
Are very offensive
And sometimes straight up rude
All those late night calls and notes
On his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom
As much as you want
And he won't really care

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I anwser I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again

X-girlfriend you can't have him
It's about time
That you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go
X-girlfriend you don't listen
(X-girlfriend)
Stop trying
He's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go

I understand why
(I understand why)
You want him back
But you don't know
Our love's too strong
For you to penetrate
It's too late
He's not your baby nomore

X girlfriend
X girlfriend
(It's tumblin' down)
X girlfriend
(X girlfriend)
(Don't listen)
X girlfriend
See I'm not gonna give in

X-girlfriend you can't have him
It's about time
That you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go
X-girlfriend you don't listen
Stop trying
He's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore
Don't you know?
You gotta let him go 
Let him go
Let him go

X-girlfriend you can't have him
It's about time
That you found you a new man
He's moved on
