When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

[Rap 1:]
Show your respect
Whenever you hear me or see me
This is the emancipation of Mimi
Hot like a real fever, the real diva
So successful, yet still so eager
No matter what they say, it's on for ever
It's our time right now, more than ever
'Til the death, we gon' get it on together
And MC, you know we belong together
Come on

[Chorus:]
I lost a part of me
When you left boy can't you see
Boy come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When the times get rough
Who's gon' talk to me
'Til the sun comes up
Who's gon' take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 1:]
I only think of you
On two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke
If I could be wit' you
Only you can make it right
Make it right, make it right

[Rap 2:]
We belong together
Like the sun in the summertime
Bounce in a lemon range
Skip in a Hummer lime
P and Kiss in and out
Mariah on the other line
Baby I'ma come back
Believe it'll come a time
We belong together
Like peanut butter and jelly
Februaries and skellies
After-parties and tellies
Feelin' you in my stomach
Like you a part of my belly
Baby I'ma come back
With every part of you ready

[Chorus:]
I lost a part of me
when you left boy can't you see
Boy come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When the times get rough
Who's gon' talk to me
'Til the sun comes up
Who's gon' take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2:]
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me
"If you think you're lonely now,
Wait until tonight"
Boy, I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life
Baby

[Rap 3:]
Let's go
You gonn' need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past
Just let it be bygones
Matter of fact I know a fly song
That we could vibe on
Let's get it straight
If it's the 6 or the quarter to eight
Then I'm thowin' Babyface or Shai on
Yeah and Kiss ghost and MC
Get close and toast to the diva and MC's
The trees will blow
Big cups, Pino Grigio
Take it easy, yo
We belong together, we know that
Now I think that it's about time we show that
Even though every moment won't be a Kodak
Sometimes we argue
I spazz out, grab my bozak
Come back not 'cause I have to, I want to
No, I don't just wanna have you
I want you

[Chorus:]
I lost a part of me
When you left boy can't you see
Boy come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When the times get rough
Who's gon' talk to me
'Til the sun comes up
Who's gon' take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
