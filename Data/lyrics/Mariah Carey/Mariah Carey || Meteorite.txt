
Gotta get up
Cause you know the world is waiting
Can you keep up
Everyone you see is racing

And you, know what you are
It's true
You will go far

Cause you got the night to light up the sky
Meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star
Your fame is the flame
They watch you burn up, turned up, turnt up all the way

Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite

So here we go,
Oh wasn't it what all you saying
Put on your show
Try to make it entertaining

And you know what you are
It's true
You will go far

Cause you got the night to light up the sky
Meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star
Your fame is the flame
They watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way

Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite
Meteorite-ite-ite

Cause you got the night to light up the sky
Meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star
Your fame is the flame
As they watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way
Yeah you got to burn up all the way
Yeah you got to turn up all the way
Yeah you got to turnt up all the way
Like meteorite
