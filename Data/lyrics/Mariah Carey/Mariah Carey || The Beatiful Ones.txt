
Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be
Baby, baby, baby
Is it him or is it me
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby

Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight
Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones
They hurt you everytime

Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always everytime

If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh baby, baby, baby
If we get married
Would that be cool
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose

Do you want him
Or do you want me
'Cause I want you...
