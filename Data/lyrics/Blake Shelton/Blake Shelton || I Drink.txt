
He'd get home at five-thirty
Fix a drink and sit down in his chair
Pick a fight with momma
Complain about the kids gettin' in his hair
At night he'd sit alone and smoke
I'd see his frown behind the lighters flame
Now that same frowns in my mirror
I got my daddy's blood inside my veins.

[Chorus:]
Fish swim, birds fly
Daddys' yell, mommas' cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink.

Chicken TV dinner
Six minutes on defrost three on high
Beer to wash it down then another
Some whiskey on the side
It's not so bad alone here
It don't bother me that every nights the same
I don't need another lover hangin' around
Tryin' to make me change.

[Chorus:]
Fish swim, birds fly
Lovers leave, by and by
Old men sit and think
I Drink.

I know, what I am
But I don't, give a damn.

[Chorus:]
Fish swim, birds fly
Daddys' yell, mommas' cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink.

I Drink.
