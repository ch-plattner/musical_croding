Body by Bowflex
Hair by Hollywood salon
Bag by Louis Vuitton

High heels, Manolo Blahniks
Tanqueray gin and tonics
Sunglass by Gucci
Never been to Chatter, hoochie

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country in her

Friday, Soho
That's where all the cool, cool people go
Shake your pelvis
That's how you get behind the velvet

Disco at the Air Bar
But what I really miss is a guitar
With a whammy bar
Going wah, wah, wah, wah

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her

Ah, hang on!

She's got a little country, got a little country
I said, she's got a little country, got a little country in her
Got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country

Giddy up!

She's runnin' with the big dogs, she's livin' on the high hog
We're rolling in the hay every night
She's even saying yeehaw ridin' that hillbilly seesaw
We're having us a ball and holding on tight

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her
