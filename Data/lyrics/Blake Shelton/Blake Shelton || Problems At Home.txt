
Fires are burning up the forests
Down along the Amazon
There's children starving in Guatemala
They're just barely hanging on

[chorus]
And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And Lord while you're listening
Could I mention some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

A teenage boy in Mississippi
Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for Mama to use

[chorus]

My wife is crying; Our baby's fighting
A battle that she may not win
The doctor's doing all that he can
God now it's all in your hands

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong

Now I'm just one man, a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem right here at home
I've got a problem right here at home
