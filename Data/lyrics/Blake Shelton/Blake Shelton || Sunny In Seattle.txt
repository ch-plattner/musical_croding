
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearin' those boots and jeans
When Memphis ain't got the blues
That's when I'll stop lovin' you
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in new Orleans

Baby, I don't mind you askin'
If there's gonna come a day
When I'll say goodbye
Maybe, I guess anything could happen
But it's as close to never
As you're ever gonna find

When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearin' those boots and jeans
When there's no tequila in Mexico
That's when I'm gonna let you go
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

Darlin', some things won't ever change
My love is one of those things

When New York is a one horse town
That's when I won't need you 'round
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
