
It brings back an old feeling
Running into you like this
I'm really not afraid of hurting
But I can't stand the awkwardness
Do I laugh
Do I cry
Do I dare look in your eyes

Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you

You seem to be a bit distracted
I wish that I could feel the same
You never were too good at acting
Baby some things never change
I can't keep from letting go
It's something that I can't control

Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you

You stand there looking sweet and innocent
But how can you be so cruel and confident
At my expense

Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at....

Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' blow
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you

Oh yeah, everytime I look at you
