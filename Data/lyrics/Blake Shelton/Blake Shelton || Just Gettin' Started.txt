Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song
(One, two, three, four)

There's a seven-forty-seven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn

And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started

We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whiskey power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home

Cause we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started

Yeah, don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight

And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started

Oh, yeah, we're just getting started
