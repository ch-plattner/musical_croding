
The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road but here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel
Of fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair
And your kiss, Girl, that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know

And I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

And I'll ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
On a ride that won't let me go
