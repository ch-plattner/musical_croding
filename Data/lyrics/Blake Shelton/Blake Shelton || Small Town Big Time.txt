Yea, Hollywood Boulevard
Looking down, seeing stars
90210, Rodeo is Rodeo
Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, and hang with my friends

With them red Maserati's and them tuned up bodies
And everybody gonna be the next somebody
Yea, this place is a trip
Hey but meanwhile back in the sticks

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or keeping the buzz sipping on a little moonlight

Yea, they know how to rock
Out in the boondocks
Cause believe me I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere

Yea, two lane town squares
Cotton queens, county fairs
With a water tank
Got 100 girls' names under the paint

Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, I miss my friends

With them pick 'em up trucks and them dirt road ruts
And all them country girls get to strutting their stuff
East, west, north or south
Yea you better believe that right about now...

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or lighting it up with a KC spotlight

Yea, they all got the swerve
Down back in their hometown
I wish that I was there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
And twisting it up and dodging them blue lights

Yea, they know how to kick it
Way out past the limits
Cause baby I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere

Yea, somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
I wish that I was there
Yea, I wish that I was there
