
You make the coffee
I try and doctor it up
A little cream and some sugar
And I think about us
Ain't it just like me
Not to say what I should
It ain't that bad
It just ain't that good

There's no way you don't notice
The silence we share
Afraid what's come between us
Has always been there
Just somewhere the truth
Got misunderstood
Naw, it ain't that bad
It just ain't that good

So we go on 
Goin' through the motions
Holdin' on
To some crazy notion
That we're not afraid of bein' alone

Yeah, we go on
Goin' through the motions
Holdin' on
To some crazy notion
That we're not afraid of bein' alone

I've packed up and left you
In the back of my mind
I'm sure you've done the same
A couple of times
The truth is by now
I thought one of us would
Guess it ain't that bad
It just ain't that good

No, we don't say goodbye
Though we probably should
Guess it ain't that bad
It just ain't that good
