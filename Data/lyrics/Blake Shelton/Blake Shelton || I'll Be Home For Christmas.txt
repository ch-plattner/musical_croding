
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Instrumental break]

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

If only in my dreams
