You told me I'd regret it
On the day I left you
I had the nerve to laugh
As I walked away
Well, its been six months
And eighteen days
Feelin' nothin' but This empty pain

And I just had to tell you

Even if there's nothin'
Left to say

[Chorus:]

I felt the burnin' on the hurtin' side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longin' on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I was gonna show you
That I didn't need you
Now I need to show you I was wrong
Here I am knees to the floor
I don't wanna live like this no more
I'm heartbeat in misery
Now all my pride is gone

[Chorus:]

I felt the burnin' on the hurtin' side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longin' on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
