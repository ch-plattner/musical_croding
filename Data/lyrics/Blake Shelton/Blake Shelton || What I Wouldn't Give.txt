
Leave the radio on just to hear a voice other than mine
Cause I can't bear to hear the cold truth running through my mind.
Cause everything I did wrong just keeps haunting me, it won't let me be
Lying here without you, girl I'm starting to see why you gave up on me.
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in my life I'd do it right this time.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give.
It kills me to think how much you tried to make things work.

I wouldn't listen to you, all I would do is put myself first.
I took you for granted and I pushed you away a little more each day.
Somewhere inside this hell I have seen my mistakes oh but now it's too late.
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in life, I'd do it right this time.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again cause of what I wouldn't give... cause of what I wouldn't give...
