If I was a cloud, I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun, I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon, I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star, charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star

If I was your man, the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man, we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man

If I was a song, I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream, I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream

If I was your man, we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby

If I-I-I-I-I was your man

you would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man

And if we were love, we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love

If I was your man, sweet lovin' man
If I was your man
If I was your man
