You get coffee
You get paid
You get off
You get gas
You get beer
You get drunk
You get weird
You get drove home
You get up thrown

You get hungry
You get chicken
Your guitar needs pickin'
You get tan
You get pale
You get sick
You get well
You get dressed up
You get messed up

Everybody say, God Almighty it's Friday
Everybody get sideways to have a little fun
Everybody's livin'
Everybody's tryin'
Everybody's dyin'
To get some

You get lost
You get saved
You get waxed
You get shaved
You get high, real high
Forget your next line
You get drive-thru, dollar menu

Everybody say, God Almighty it's Friday
Everybody get sideways to have fun
Everybody's livin'
Everybody's tryin'
Everybody's dyin'
To get some

[Guitar]

You get the girl
You get the one
You get her home
You get'r done
You get hitched
You get mad
She gets a lawyer
She gets half
You get banged up
You gotta raise up
That red Dixie cup

And everybody say, God Almighty it's Friday
Everybody get sideways to have a little fun
Everybody's livin'
Everybody's tryin'
Everybody's dyin' to get some
Everybody's dyin' to get some
Dyin' to get some
