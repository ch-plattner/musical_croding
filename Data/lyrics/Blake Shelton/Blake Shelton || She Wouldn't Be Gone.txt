
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you 
Took you home set you on the counter 
Oh, at least a time or two 
Maybe she'd thought it through. 

Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view 
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you 
I could have done that a whole lot more 
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish 
Thought about her more, thought about me less 
Joked and maked her laugh, held her when she cried 
A little more that.. maybe I... 

Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway 
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be 
Going any place she might go beating on the dash 
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face 
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe... 
She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone.. 

She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change 
She was leaving 
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out, 
God, I believe her now 
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend 
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin, they ain't sayin... 
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late 
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes. 

Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I"ll.. 
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway 
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be 
Going any place she might go beating on the dash 
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face 
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe... 
She wouldn't be gone.. 

I wouldn't be beating on the dash 
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face 
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe... 
She wouldn't be gone.. 

Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you 
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two 
Maybe she'd thought it through...
