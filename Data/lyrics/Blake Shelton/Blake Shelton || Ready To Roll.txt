Fingers to the bone I need
A little hit of you and me
A little time alone

All day I've been thinking about
Quitting early skipping out
Hollin' ass to hit the couch
And hang with you at home

We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Let other fools go paint the town
We'll just hold this sofa down
Till Monday morning rolls around
I'll tell you what let's do

You go grab those tater chips
I'll whip up some party dip
And well kick back and take a trip
Sip a beer or two

We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Yeah we got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Yeah I'm ready to roll
Ready to roll
