
Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're goin'
They leave a lot of good things behind

Guess you could call me a dreamer
And I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
And do all the things they tell me to
Yeah I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last
Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

Oh yeah whisper baby
