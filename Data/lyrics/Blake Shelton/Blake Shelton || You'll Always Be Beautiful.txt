You always get dolled up for your party 
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year 
'Cause you always forget that you're so small 
You can't take all that alcohol 
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car 

But you'll always be beautiful 
You'll always be beautiful 
To me 

I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before 
Your headaches and your fussin' and cussin' the sun 
The makeup you had on your face 
Is now all over your pillow case 
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball 

But you'll always be beautiful 
You'll always be beautiful 
To me 

So baby don't you ever doubt 
When father time starts drawing out 
Those lines around your eyes 

'Cause you'll always be 
You'll always be 
Beautiful 
You'll always be beautiful 
To me
