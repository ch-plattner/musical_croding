
There a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane blacktop
Where all the folks come to hear country music play
And every year the city's gettin' closer, Lord knows it won't stop
And old Hank the bartender gave us the bad news today, yeah he said

[CHORUS:]

This land was our land but Lord now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
'Til we've sung the last country song

There's 300 acres of cotton corn and a little bit of gravel
All bought up by a builder from downtown
Tomorrow when the earth starts a-shakin and the walls start to rattle
A big bulldozer's gonna take Hank's roadhouse down, so everybody sing

[CHORUS]

Will we play "Swingin'" or "He Stopped Loving Her Today"
It's really sad to see it end this way

[CHORUS]

'Til we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song
