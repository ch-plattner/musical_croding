
If time has no end and if time has no end 
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity 
A cirlce an enternal loop 
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth

Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 

Before we were babies 
There's nothing we recall and when we go back 
Will it fade to black and that's all 
Or could we be destined for some other time and place 
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased

Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 

Will we see Jesus comin as the sunshine fills the night 
Or when we die will we fly into the light 
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away 
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe 
Someday we'll know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday
