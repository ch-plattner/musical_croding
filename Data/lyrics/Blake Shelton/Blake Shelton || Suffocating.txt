Pain is growing like a vine stanglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating

When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still suffocating

The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from a storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating

When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still suffocating

Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
'Cause nothin's changed, nothin's changed

When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still

Suffocating
