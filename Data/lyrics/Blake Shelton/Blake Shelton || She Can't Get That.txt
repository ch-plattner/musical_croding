
He meets her at the front door, he can tell she's had a hard day at work
She's been needing him and he's sure been wantin' her
He touches her with tenderness, takes her in his arms and takes it slow
What a shame she can't get that at home.

[Chorus:]
What a shame she can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house 
And love ain't all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants 
What a shame she can't get that at home.

After the lovin', they lie there and talk for a while
She loves how he listens and he sure loves to see her smile
He wants to keep her but he loves her enough to let her go
What a shame she can't get that at home.

[Chorus:]
What a shame she can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house
And love ain't all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home.

He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home...
