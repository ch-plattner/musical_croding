
There's so many things we can do this Christmas
Just once I wanna go on a ride in a one horse sleigh
Go caroling down the street while everybody listens
Singing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingling all the way

And if snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us
Call up the neighbors and call up a bottle of cheer
Um, there's so many we things can do this christmas
ha ha, Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Oh yeahâ€¦

[Instrumental]

Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
