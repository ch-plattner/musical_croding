And all my friends are cruisin' 'round town.
Checkin' out the pretty girls
Hey! And what do they say
They say hey, hey,
Park that Deere, come out and play,
Kick that tire, wipe my perspire
Cause my whole life is hay.

Growin' like weeds, stick out your teeth
Playin' underneath the baby Jesus
Blowin' out the truck, headin' down the highway
Lookin' pretty soft up in the loft
Come on baby kick your cowgirls off
I'm pickin' you up after I draw my pay
And we'll be rollin' in the hay

Hey, hey, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet
Different strokes for different folks
A little fella walks up in a pink beret
He says "Hey" - Hey, hell that's OK
Turn the guitars up and raise them cups
Hell my whole life is hay.

Growin' like weeds, stick out your teeth
Playin' underneath the baby Jesus
Blowin' out the truck, headin' down the highway
Lookin' pretty soft up in the loft
Come on baby kick your cowgirls off
I'm pickin' you up after I draw my pay
And we'll be rollin' in the hay

Put it on a flatbed and go for a ride
Under the moonlight, you by my side
Give it to the cow, make it go moo
Koo-koo-kachoo, kick it off your shoe
Break a camel's back, jack
Then you put it in a stack yeah.

Growin' like weeds, stick out your teeth
Playin' underneath the baby Jesus
Blowin' out the truck, headin' down the highway
Lookin' pretty soft up in the loft
Come on baby kick your cowgirls off
I'm pickin' you up after I draw my pay
And we'll be rollin' in the hay

My whole life is hay
Rollin' in the hay
Hey!
Now come here, hey, hey
Hey!
