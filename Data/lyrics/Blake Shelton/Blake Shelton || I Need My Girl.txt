
I don't need another drink of Johnny Walker Red
And I don't need another drag off a Marlboro cigarette
And I don't need me telling myself everything's gonna be alright
And I don't need me lying here alone again tonight

I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl

I don't need those buddies of mine taking me on the town
Or a TV preacher warning me bout the road I'm going down
I don't need to let I'm Sorry not roll off my lips
And I don't need to let my pride talk me out of this

I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl

Like I never needed anything before
Like my life depends on you walking through that door
I need you, girl
Oh, I need you, girl

I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl

I just need my girl
Just need my girl
I just need my girl
