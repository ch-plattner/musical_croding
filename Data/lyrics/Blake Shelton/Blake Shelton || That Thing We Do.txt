
Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
An old dirt road

I wanna see your bare feet on my dash
The night wind blowing your hair back
Slide across that seat
And sit real close

Baby, let's go

Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck

We'll kick 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do

We'll take some blankets and we'll make a spread
I'll tuck you into my pick-up bed
We'll watch the country stars
Puttin' on a show

I want to see your bare skin in the moonlight
Kiss your lips, girl, and hold you all night
Make a lot of love
And make it real slow

Baby, let's go

Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck

We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do

We've been runnin' 'round doin' this and that
It's time we got back to what we're good at

Snugglin' up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck

We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
Yeah, we'll be doin' that thing we do
Doin' that thing we do

Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
