[Blake:]
Well the moon just came over the tree tops 
And the whipper wheel started to sing 
So I slipped down the hill 
Got into the still 
And drank til my ears started to ring 

I followed a trail to through the hollow 
To a shack back in the woods 
Its my eighteenth birthday 
Honey come out and play 
Its time that we got to no good 

[Duet:]
Now I aint afraind to be lonely 
But I still wanna learn about love 
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild 
Come lay down on my bare skin rug 

[Miranda:]
My dress is torn up and tattered 
My daddy left a long time ago 
And my hair just hangs down 
I never made it to town 
Momma said thats where bad people go 

But me and my sister been talkin' 
Shes eighteen one year older than me 
She laid down with a man 
I want to understand what she says 
I'll never believe 

[Duet:]
Now I aint afraind to be lonely 
But I still wanna learn about love 
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild 
Lay me down on your bare skin rug 

[Blake:]
Now I need a woman 
[Miranda:]
And I need a man 
[Duet:]
We aint got nobody 
An' we aint even kin 

Now I aint afraind to be lonely 
But I still wanna learn about love 
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild 
Lay me down on your bare skin rug 
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
