
You say you don't know what you were thinking,
Well neither do I.
And after the time we spent together,
You think you deserve another try.

Well girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye

And say you're sorry,
Oh, you're sorry,
You want it back the way it was.
Well I'm sorry,
But sometimes sorry,
Just ain't good enough.

You say you never meant to hurt me,
Well that might be true.
But do you really think I should forgive you,
For what you put me through.

Oh, I remember every time you said you loved me
But I know now your love was just a lie

And you say you're sorry,
Oh you're sorry,
You want it back the way it was.
Well I'm sorry,
But sometimes sorry,
Just ain't good enough.

Oh, girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye

And say you're sorry...

Oh, you're sorry,
So sorry,
And you want it back the way it was.
Well I'm sorry,
But sometimes sorry,
Just ain't good enough.
