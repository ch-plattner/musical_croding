
I never liked the taste of whiskey til I kissed it off of her lips
Never knew just what was hitting me, getting me tipsy
But there I sit, Levi's on a dogwood branch
Yeah, she was taking me under
I might have lost my innocence
But she was saving my soul that summer

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

She might have been a falling angel
Nah, I didn't care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered, sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
That's the way I could spend forever

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

Oh yeah, just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine

Yeah, that'd be mine
Oh, just a little bit south of heaven
