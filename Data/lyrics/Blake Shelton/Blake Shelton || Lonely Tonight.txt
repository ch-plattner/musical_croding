I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be
Sitting at home all alone like me

Nothing on TV, nothing to do
Nothing to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinking 'bout it now because...

...I could be there in five?
One more, one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those "kiss-me" eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be,
Baby, I want you, and you want me

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

I can be there in five
One more, one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Oh, I need you and I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight... tonight... tonight
Yeah... yeah.
