And I've been in it all day
Putting up with that prick of an owner's son
Making me some hillbilly pay

Working right through lunch, busting my hump
Helping his daddy stay rich
So when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
I told that little son of a bitch

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me son
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Yea I've been dragging home almost every night
'Bout the time that you're going out
Wearing something way too short and tight
Leaving me and the dog on a couch

Yea, now word's getting round you've been sneaking downtown
Dancing way too risky
Well I got a few dirty dance moves too
And a cute little one finger wave

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Here it comes

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been busting my ass, you don't care about that
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Oh yea
Woo!
Yes I do
Look at that thing
You know you're number one, baby
