Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wander the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much 
You're missed

[Chorus:]
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry, dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all
Two distant hearts can do
Oh-ooh, at least were underneath 
Underneath the same moon

Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear 
Oh I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Oh hold on please
Won't you wait for me

[Repeat Chorus]

la la la 
la la la
la la la 
Oh-ooh At least were underneath
Underneath the same moon

Shadows of the night
Moving all around
Moving on the ground 
They follow me around
