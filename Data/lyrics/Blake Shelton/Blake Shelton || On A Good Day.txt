On A Good Day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On A Good Day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On A Good Day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm gonna be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' On A Good Day.

So set em up 
Here's a hundred dollars keep em comin' Joe (whoa whoa)
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother 
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On A Good Day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' On A Good Day.

On A Good Day, I would never crash a party
Knowin' she'd be there with someone else
And On A Good Day, I would have stopped before I started 
To make a major fool of myself
On A Good Day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' On A Good Day.

Yeah I only see you Joe
When I'm not havin' A Good Day
No I'm not havin' A Good Day.
