
Little by little, now babe
I've come a long, long way
Picking up the pieces
That you threw away
Did you give it up
Did I let you down
Either way, it doesn't matter
Cause I'm finally comin' 'round
I hope you find where you belong
Hello - goodbye
Life goes on

In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But, I could never let her stay
Cause, love
Your sweet love
Still gets in the way

Minute by minute
I hear the voice in my heart
And make a new start
So, I think a little less
I drink a little more
Cause, all in all she's everything
That I've been waiting for
She smiles that smile
I face the fact
Love's a give and take thing
And I can't give it back
