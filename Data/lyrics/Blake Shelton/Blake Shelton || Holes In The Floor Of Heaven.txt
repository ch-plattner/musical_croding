One day shy of 8 years old, grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy, blowin out that birthday cake.
How I cried when the sky let go, with a cold and lonesome rain,
Momma smiled said don't be sad child, grandma's watchin you today.

[Chorus]
'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven and her tears are pourin down
that's how you know she's watchin, wishing she could be here now.
and sometimes if your lonely, just remember she can see,
there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watchin over you and me.

Season's come and seasons go, nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love, met a girl who took my name.
Year by Year, made a life in this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together, lord I sure do miss her now!

[Chorus]

But there's holes in the floor of heaven, and her tears are pourin down.
That's how I know she's watchin, wishing she could be here now.
And sometimes when I'm lonely, I remember she can see,
there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watchin over you and me.

Well my little girl is 23, I walk her down the aisle,
Its a shame her mom can't be here now, to see her lovely smile.
They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts comin down.
She takes my hand says daddy don't be sad, 'cause I know Momma is watchin now.
And there's holes in the floor of heaven, and her tears are pourin down.
thats how you know she's watchin, wishin she could be here now.
And sometimes when I'm lonely, I remember she can see,
Yes, there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watchin over you and me.

Watchin over you and me
Watchin over you and me
Watchin over you and me.
