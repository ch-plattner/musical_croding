On Friday night when I see her out
Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There ain't a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is..

[chorus]
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad we want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me

She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move

She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me

I'm gonna work my courage up
Tell her I'm in love
I'm in love a lot
She has my heart on a string
Like everything the girl has got

She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me

She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
