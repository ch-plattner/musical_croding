Anyone else would shake my hand
Wish me luck, be proud for a friend
But a jealous guy won't share the sun
When it feels threatened by anyone
Yeah, anyone else would open the door
Helping me find what I was looking for
When you smile there's always a catch
Like I didn't earn everything I have

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?

Cause nobody else would make me feel dumb
For being myself or needing someone
And I can't tell, are you ever sincere?
Did they treat you like this when you showed up here?

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, you want it all
And you want everyone to see
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
