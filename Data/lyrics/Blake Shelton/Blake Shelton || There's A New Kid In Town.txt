[Blake Shelton:]
We’re looking for the King,
The new Messiah
We’re following the star,
Shining brighter
Old man won’t you help us if you can
He shook his head but he point pointed his hand

There’s a new kid in town
And he’s lying in a manger down the road
There’s a new kid in town
But he’s just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There’s a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem

[Kelly Clarkson:]
I see you’ve traveled far,
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new King’s pleasures
I have heard that a King might come
But up ‘til now there hasn’t been one

[Blake Shelton & Kelly Clarkson (2x)]
There’s a new kid in town
And he’s lying in a manger down the road
There’s a new kid in town
But he’s just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There’s a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
