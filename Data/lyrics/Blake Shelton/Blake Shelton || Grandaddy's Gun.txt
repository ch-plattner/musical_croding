
It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun

He bought it new out of a Sears & Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many shell over the top of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun

It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun

He handed it to me on the day I turned 13
With a half-shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
With granddaddy's gun

It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun

There's a long beard living on the living room wall
That I got with a box call
And granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on 49
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
Granddaddy's gun

It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for sale
