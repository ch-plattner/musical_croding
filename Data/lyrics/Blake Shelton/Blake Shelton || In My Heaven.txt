In my heaven there ain't no lawyers
Don't need names on dotted lines
Folks do business like they oughtta
A good firm handshake works just fine
We feed lawyers to the lions

In my heaven there ain't no children
Totin' loaded guns to school
Ain't no such thing as peer pressure
Being who you are is cool
They still teach that golden rule

In my heaven we hurt no one
No lying, crying, or dying young
No one's lonely, no one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven

In my heaven I can sing like Elvis
Play guitar like B. B. King
Slide a fastball past Hank Aaron
Batter, batter, batter swing
I can do most anything

In my heaven we hurt no one
No lying, crying, or dying young
No one's lonely, no one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven

I know that it's God's decision
What my heaven's gonna be
And I ain't telling him his business
But if he left it up to me

Then in my heaven
There's football with no referees
In my heaven
There's never been an injury
In my heaven
Angels yodel when they sing
In my heaven
The fish'll bite most anything
In my heaven
In my heaven
In my heaven
