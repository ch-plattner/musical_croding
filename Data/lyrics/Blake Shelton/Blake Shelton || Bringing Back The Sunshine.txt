Been forever since I've been gone
Haven't held you in so long
Miss you more than words can say
Guess we've got a little off track
But love knows a way back
Through the storms and pouring rain

Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh

Every moment, every sweet kiss
All the loving that we both missed
It's okay to let em go
Yesterday's all forgotten
And today we start rocking
Somewhere underneath the rainbow

Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh
Oh yeah, bringing back, oh

Oh, bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh

Bringing back, bringing back
Oh, I'm bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh
Bringing back, oh yeah
