
Work, work, work, man that's all I ever do
Been hitting it, getting it, giving it, living them working man blues
Working on that pick-up, working on that check
Working on that twerking, man it still ain't working yet

Hey, can I get a little, "Hey man"
Anybody been where I've been
It just don't stop when you punch that clock
Gotta rock on right through the weekend
Gotta keep on keeping on, gotta keep that percolator perking
Got a wheel, got a way, got a hang, got a how
And right now I'm just working on a big buzz

Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-buzzin

Mm, baby girl when you get a few in you
Don't you know that you tend to get a little wild
(Get a little wild, get a little wild child, get a little wild)
When you're shooting that fireball whiskey
Get to getting all fireball frisky, you a hot little jockey
Nothing rocks me like you rocking me on a big buzz

Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-b-buzzin
