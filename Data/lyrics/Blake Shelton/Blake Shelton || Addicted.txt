She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight
She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain't right
So if he won't call, she'll survive
And if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head and cry.

From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should've told you before

She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
She doesn't know which way to move
Oh no

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
If she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard

She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge, about to fall from leaning out again
She don't know which way to move
It's hurts to feel like such a fool cause she don't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool
