Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I wanna go home
I need to go home

Maybe surrounded by
Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I wanna go home
God I miss you, you know

I can close my eyes and see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same

Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
And I wont leave you alone
And I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just to far from where you are
And I wanna go home

[Guitar solo]

Now the reasons I'm so far away ain't good enough
What ever they need me for
I know that I need you more
So I'll do the things I got to do to get back to you
I need you to believe
I'll make it back by Christmas eve

Another Christmas day will come and go away
And I wont leave you alone
No I'm gonna go home
I'm gonna be home
Though I'm surrounded by
This cold December night
I feel so alone
I'm gonna go home
Babe, I miss you you know

Let me go home
I've had my run baby I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright
When I'm holding you tight
Cause this Christmas I'm home
