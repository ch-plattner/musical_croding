
I saw you sittin' there sippin' red wine down at Causen Mills
I knew you'd prob'ly be outta my league but I though, what the hell?
Aw, what the hell
Five dollars a glass was kickin' my butt but I kept on buyin'
I kinda thought you were into me
So I kept on tryin' to get them sparks a'flyin'

In my forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
All I had to my name was a big ol' truck and a little ol' place
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoo-hoo-hoo

I asked you if you ever stared up at the stars from a tailgate
Down by the river with a six pack
You said no, but it sure sounds great
You climbed up in my old truck
Sittin' right beside me
I cranked up a country song
And you started smilin'
Yeah, this ol' boy was stylin'

In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, I missed work for three days
Kissin' on you, didn't get paid
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Hoo-hoo-hoo

We been together ever since that night
You're still in love with that same old guy
Same old guy

In forty dollar blue jeans 
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, we set a date for next spring
Workin' two jobs, pickin' out rings
I can't help but think
I can't afford to love you
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Hoo-hoo-hoo

I can't afford not to
Love on you
