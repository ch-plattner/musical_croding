You know if I'd seen her comin'
I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I thought she'd say to me

[Chorus 1]
Well it was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

I felt like some neighbor
Just some guy she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and
Introduced me to her new friend John

[Chorus 2]
I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I knew she'd say to me

[Chorus 3]
I guess she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone ignored
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

[Chorus 4]
I know it might sound crazy
But I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me
