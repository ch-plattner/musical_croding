I played some Stones and Skynyrd songs
Last night on the jukebox
And I'm gettin' back to hatin' me some soft rock
I don't almost reck' seein' if its you
Every time a midnight blue Pontiac
Pulls into the parkin' lot
Believe it or not

I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
I'm kind of okay
With you out of my life
I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright

Alright

I took down most the magnets
And pictures of us in Cabo
I forgot my 'fridgerator
Was avocado (What?)
And I still might call every now and then
Way too late, just checkin' in
Tellin' you how good its been to let go
Aww, and baby to let you know

I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
I'll be kind of okay
In a couple more Bud Lights
Oh, I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright

I might get a little sideways
Yeah, but what do you expect?
I might have a few bad days
I'm figuring out its for the best

I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
Would it be kind of okay
If I came by tonight?
Oh, I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
Yeah, I'm posolutely, absotutely almost alright

Alright
Almost alright
Hey, can I come over tonight, baby?
Ha-ha!
