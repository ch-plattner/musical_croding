
I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be

So we talked awhile
'Til she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

[Chorus]
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you

You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

Well I wasn't surprised
Still it hit me kinda hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart

I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

[Chorus]
And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you

You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

[Bridge]
But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

I found someone
Just happened outta the blue
It took everything I had
It took me losing you

But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun

Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone
