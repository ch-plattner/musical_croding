
Mason jars on the dresser 
Filled with quarters and dollars savin em for our trip around the world 
But now you've changed your tune 
There'll be no honeymoon 
So I'm going there without you girl

I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of tequila 
Going down to Purto Rico in a bottle of rum
Going to Honolulu in a mai tai mug 
Then I'm coming back home to 
Georgia in a jug.

We'll never ride that bus to Mexico City 
It's a pity we'll never sail our ship into Waikiki and 
We'll never share that brick suburban home 
Today I'm taking that money out of the jar 
Tonight I'll buy my ticket down at the corner bar

I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of tequila 
Going down to Purto Rico in a bottle of rum
Going to Honolulu in a mai tai mug 
Then I'm coming back home to 
Georgia in a jug.
