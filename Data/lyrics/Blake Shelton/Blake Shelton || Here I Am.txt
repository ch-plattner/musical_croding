
You were just some one 
Some friend of mine said take her out 
An' have yourselves a good time 
To be honest I was far from over a broken heart 
You were the furthest thing from my mind 
And it didnt seem to matter to you 
When I looked away when we were introduced 

Cause you broke the ice with a killer smile 
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while 
And I slowly started comin' around 
Now here I am 

To tell the truth I did my best to tell myself 
Hey dont forget the last time 
And I stood there in disbelief 
That how easily you got to me with your eyes 
You reached across the table and you took my hand 
I knew I was in trouble right there and then 

When you broke the ice with a killer smile 
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while 
And I slowly started comin' around 
Now here I am 

Down on one knee 
Am I getting to you baby? 
The way you got to me 

When you broke the ice with a killer smile 
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while 
And I slowly started comin' around 
Now here I am
