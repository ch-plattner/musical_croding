
There's music in the city
And lights are on display
There's a big ol tree for all to see
where the children run and play

I look out my window
Somethin' just don't seem right
Til I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line

Now it's christmas, christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama called and said it's time for me come on home

The pies are in the oven
you can almost taste the air
It warms my heart to feel her love 
and know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back to where you belong
it's the difference between just a melody and my favorite christmas song

Well, it's christmas, christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama called and said "it's time for You come on home"
Mama just called and said "it's time for you to come home"
