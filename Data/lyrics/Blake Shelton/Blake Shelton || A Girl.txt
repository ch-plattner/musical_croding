Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught

These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl

How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no

These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
All you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl

Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Mmhmm, just a girl, just a girl
