
I can taste your kiss on my lips 
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips 
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin 
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine 
Go to my head girl every time 
And I get drunk on you 
I lose control and then 
And here I go again 

[Chorus]
I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart 
Tomorrow might be hell 
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all 
And I can't help myself 
So I'll just hold on 
I'll just hold on 
I'll just hold on 
Until your gone 

Girl I know you're a gypsy soul 
And I'm just a stop along your road 
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind 
If I had a star for every scar 
You tattooed on my heart 
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky 
So girl I don't know why 

[Chorus]

I'll just hold on 
I'll just hold on 
I'll just hold on 
Till your gone 

I look down and my cell phone rings 
And I see your name and I know what that means 
But I don't care 
I'll just hold on 
Till your gone 

Every time you need to take it home? 
Seeing you there just breaks my heart? 
I don't care 
I'll just hold on 
Till your gone 

Your green eyes and that sweet red wine 
Go to my head girl every time 
But I don't care 
I'll just hold on 
Till your gone
