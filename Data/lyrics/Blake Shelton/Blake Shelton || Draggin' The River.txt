
Hey, baby I just asked your daddy
If I could take your hand
He said, "Boy, over my dead body"
Guess I ain't his kinda man

But I love you and you love me
So, baby I gotta plan
We'll push my truck off of Red Top Bridge
Right below the Jackson Dam

Hey, they'll be draggin' the river
Catchin' nothin' but an ol' catfish
They'll be draggin' the river
That'll show that son of a bitch

It's been rainin' for the last two weeks
So the water's up good and high
We'll just wait 'til it's good n' late
So there ain't nobody passin' by

I'll call my cousin
He'll pick us up an' take us to the Greyhound Bus
We'll be standin' in front of that preacher
By the time they're lookin' for us

And they'll be draggin' the river
But they ain't gonna find a thing
They'll be draggin' the river
I'll be wearin' me a diamond ring

Ah, we're gonna show 'em

I know that it might sound crazy
Just a little bit too extreme
But to get some of your sweet lovin'
Baby, I'd do anything

Sooner or later
They'll find my letter sayin' that we're alright
We'll be rockin' at the Red Roof Inn
This time tomorrow night

And they'll be draggin' the river
Sayin', "Lord, what a cryin' shame"
They'll be draggin' the river
We'll be runnin', they'll never see it comin'

They'll be draggin' the river
They'll be draggin' the river
But they ain't gonna find a thing

Sorry about callin' your dad a son of a bitch earlier
Hey, do you think he'll still hire me?
Whoa, that thing's little
The diamond, I mean
