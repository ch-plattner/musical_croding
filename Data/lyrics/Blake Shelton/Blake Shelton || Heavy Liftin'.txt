
Yeah!

I hit the ground runnin' with the mornin' sun.
When a job needs doin', I get it done.
I show up early an' I go home late.
Everybody knows I pull my weight.

'Cause I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.

Well, baby, I hurt, he done me wrong.
The goin' got tough an' got gone.
Well, he ain't here an' I ain't him.
An' even if the walls come fallin' in.

You know I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Yeah.

Baby, when your heart is achin',
Lean on me, my back ain't breakin'.
All I'm sayin' is:

I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.

Honey, I ain't quittin',
I'm always givin',
My everything.

Yeah.

As long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Yeah.
