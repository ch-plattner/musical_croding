
There's a house that's a little run down
This city ain't never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up
Seven children raised on love
When life gets hard that's where we go

[chorus]
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home

Daddy built it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road
I get that feeling in my soul
I thank God some things still remain

[Repeat chorus]

Once I get myself through that old screen door
The world can't touch me anymore

[Repeat chorus]

That's what I call home
That's what I call home
