Been wound up tighter than a banjo string
Price of gas groceries and all those things
They sound little till you add 'em all up
Then you really feel the crunch.
Man, I've had enough.

I need to chill, give it a rest
Get down to the lake with a full ice chest
And chill, and let a cold corona
Lift this world right off my shoulders
Lime in the water, steak on the grill
I think it's way past time for me to chill
Just chill.

This morning 65 was a parking lot
Bumper to bumper just start and stop
Sometimes I think we're like a bunch of rats
Getting caught in our own traps
Well, I say to hell with that.

I need to chill give it a rest
Get down to the lake with a full ice chest
And chill, and let a cold corona
Lift this world right off my shoulders
Lime in the water, steak on the grill
I think it's way past time for me to chill
Just chill.

Before we go to therapy and take another pill
We just need to chill, give it a rest
Lay down in a hammock and take a deep breath
And chill, it don't cost a dime
To reel in your troubles and just unwind
Cork in the water and time to kill
You can't tell me this ain't a great way to chill
Just chill

Man, I need to chill.
Just chill.
