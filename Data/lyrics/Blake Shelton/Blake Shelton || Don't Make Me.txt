
Girl when I look at you
You look through me
Like I'm not even there
I try not to give up, to be strong but
I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place
Your heart is hiding
I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time
For me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

What if when I'm long gone
It dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear
If I leave here
It's done; I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
Well I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time
For me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me

(Don't make me)

Baby I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go

Don't make me
Stop loving you

(Don't make me)

Stop needing you
