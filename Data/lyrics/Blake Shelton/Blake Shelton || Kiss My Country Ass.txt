
Tearin' down a dirt road 
Rebel flag flyin' 
Coon dog in the back 
Truck bed loaded down with beer 
And a cold one in my lap 
Earnhart sticker behind my head 
And my woman by my side 
Tail-pipe's poppin' 
the radio's rockin' "Country Boy Can Survive" 
If you got a problem with that, ha ha! 
You can kiss my country ass 

Well, I love Turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans 
Smoke nothin' but Marlboro reds 
Tattoos up & down my arms, 
And deer heads over my bed. 
My Granddaddy fought in World War Two, 
My Daddy went to Vietnam. 
And I ain't scared to grab my gun, 
And fight for my homeland. 
If you don't love the American flag, 
You can kiss my country ass. 

If you're a down home, backwoods redneck, 
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass. 
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd, 
You can kiss my country ass. Aw yeah! 

[Instrumental break]

Aw yeah... 

Well, there's a whole lotta high-class people out there 
That's lookin' down on me 
Cause the country club where I belong 
Is the Honky Tonk till three in the mornin' 
Don't wear no fancy clothes 
No ties or three piece suits. 
You can find me in my camouflage cap 
My t-shirt and cowboy boots 
If that don't fit your social class 
You can kiss my country ass 

If you're a down home, backwoods redneck 
Hey, come on, stand up and raise your glass 
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd 
You can kiss my country ass 

Well I'm a front-porch sittin', 
Guitar pickin', moonshine sippin', 
Backer juice spittin' country boy from the woods 
And I love fried chicken & blue gill fishin' 
And outlaw women, an' I wouldn't change if I could. NO! 
I ain't tryin' to start no fight, but I'll finish one every time 
So you just mind your own damn business 
Stay the hell outta mine. 
If you got a problem with that 
You can kiss my country ass 

I said if you got a problem with any of that 
You can kiss my natural born, Redneck to the bone 
Ever-lovin' country ass.
