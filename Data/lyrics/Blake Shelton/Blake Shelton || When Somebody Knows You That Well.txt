
Tommy's daddy, kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough,
To do what Daddy's did.
It didn't take us long to go
From drunk to really sick.
When I walked in my house,
I stumbled just a bit.

You play it cool,
But it's no use,
Dad ain't no fool,
And that's the truth.
Chewing gum won't cover,
Up that smell.
You can't hide one single thought,
If you try, you'll just get caught.
When somebody knows you that well.

We lost Daddy,
In nineteen ninety-nine.
I took care of everybody's pain,
Except for mine.
And then one night, 
My wife took my face in her hands.
She said, "I think it's time you cry 
for your old man."

You play it cool, 
But it's no use.
She ain't no fool,
And that's the truth.
And my teardrops finally fell.
You can't hide one single thought,
If you try, you'll just get caught.
When somebody knows you that well.

I could probably do more,
To help my fellow man.
But life gets busy,
And I hope God understands.
Someday, when I get time,
I'll do more than my share.
Funny how I'm thinkin' this,
Sittin' in my easy chair.

You play it cool,
But it's no use.
God ain't no fool,
And that's the truth.
And he won't let you fool yourself.
You can't hide one single thought,
If you try, you'll just get caught. 
When somebody knows you that well...

When somebody knows you that well.
