[Verse:]
There she was;
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with a new guy.
And I'd heard about him.
I heard she found him right around when we said good-bye.

And I came real close and almost lost my temper.
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered...

[Chorus:]
I don't care.
She don't matter.
I don't love her anymore, he can have her!
I don't know why it slips my mind,
I tell myself all the time;
Guess I forgot again for a second there;
That I don't care.

[Verse:]
Almost 10:00.
I should've known his car would still be parked in her drive.
Almost pulled in;
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind.

Oh, but I just kept on driving back to my place;
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when...

[Chorus:]
I don't care.
She don't matter.
I don't love her anymore, he can have her!
I don't know why it slips my mind,
I tell myself all the time;
Guess I forgot again for a second there;
That I don't care.

[Bridge:]
When I got home, the light was blinkin' on that old machine.
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left.
And, I miss you! Give me a ring."

[Chorus:]
I still care!
She's all that matters!
I still love her just like always, gotta have her.
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime.
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care!
I don't care.
