I’ll have a blue Christmas without you
I’ll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won’t be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You’ll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Instrumental break]

You’ll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
