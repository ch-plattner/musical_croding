
Now listen to me, this here is how it used to be..... 

I can see the day that I wont wanna hang out with the boys all night 
Yeah and I can see a day when I'll walk off this dead end job for good 
And I can see a day when I wont be afraid of getting older 
But no matter what I do 
Honey I cant see me never lovin' you 

Some things are bound to change 
But some things stay the same like they ought to 
Some things are meant to be 
Just like you and me together 
If I die today or if i find a way to live forever 
No matter what I do 
Darlin' I cant see me never lovin' you 

Yeah and I can see a time when you wont think you look as good as you used to 
Ohh and I can see a time your auburn hair will turn to gray 
And I can see a time when you think that you wont blow my mind but I can tell you 
No matter what I do 
Darlin' I cant see me never lovin' you 

Some things are bound to change 
But some things stay the same like they ought to 
Some things are meant to be 
Just like you and me together 
If I die today or if i find a way to live forever 
No matter what I do 
I cant see me never lovin' you 

No matter what I do 
Honey I cant see me never lovin' you
