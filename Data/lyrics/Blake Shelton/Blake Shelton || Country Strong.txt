
Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low 
Makin that bacon, row by row 
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA 
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay 
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn 
No doubt about it that boy's country strong 

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on 
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home 
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones 
No doubt about it that boy's country strong 

He wears an old felt hat on his head 
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed 
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands 
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand 
There ain't no lettin' up all day long 
No doubt about it that boy's country strong 

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those Tony Llama's on 
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home 
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones 
No doubt about it that boy's country strong 

Yea behind every good man, there's a woman 
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin' 

She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on 
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home 
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones 
No doubt about it that girl's country strong 

Cowboy's, plowboys, good hearted women 
They're all country strong
