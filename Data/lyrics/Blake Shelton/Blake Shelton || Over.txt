[Verse 1:]
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

[Chorus:]
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Ohhh

[Verse 2:]
If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one

[Chorus: x2]
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Ohhh

[Ending:]
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears...
