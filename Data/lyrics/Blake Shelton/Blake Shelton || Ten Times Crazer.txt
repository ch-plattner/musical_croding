
Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake

But I'm ten times crazier without about your love, girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

Well I'm all about a weekend, kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinkin' that I won't leave them hanging
Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
