
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well here I am
It ain't no big surprise
You got a broken heart to kill
Tired of knowing how it feels
When you learn you been living
A lie

Oh, and ain't that a shame
You shouldn't feel such pain

But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down

Mmm, mmm, mmm

So go ahead and take your shot
Drink your whiskey on the rocks
And tell me how
You'll never find the one
But Lord knows it hurts me bad
Every time I see you sad
Knowing that my love
Goes on and on

Oh, it just ain't right
You're alone tonight

But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down

Mmm, mmm, mmm

You can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down

Mmm, mmm, mmm

I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well, here I am
It ain't no big surprise
