Lookout!
People used to call me backwards, 
Living out here with the tractors, 
Letting this world leave me behind. 
Now-a-days I'm an innovator 
I'm a country boy prognosticator 
I'm a man ahead of my times 

I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a john deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans 
I've got a guitar I play unplugged 
I've got a home-grown girl I love, 
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing 

Sheets on the clothes line drying 
Red Tail hawks a flying 
A couple of deer on the timber line 
And I know a lot more about cane pole fishing 
then I ever will know about carbon emission 
And my little corner of the world is doing just fine 

I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a john deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans 
I've got a guitar I play unplugged 
I've got a home-grown girl I love, 
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing 

Yeah, I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a john deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard, full of root baked potatos and greens 
I've got a guitar I play unplugged 
I've got a home-grown girl I love, 
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing 
I was green before green was a thing 

Oh yeah.
