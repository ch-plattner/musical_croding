
I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time 
Honey you are so persuasive 
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time

'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind 

I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does

But keep on asking if you're inclined
But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind
