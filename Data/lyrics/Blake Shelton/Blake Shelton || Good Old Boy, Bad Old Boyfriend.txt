He's got you cryin' again
Baby baby baby 
He's got you cryin' again
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.

I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.

He kicks off his shoes throws down this coat
Opens a beer grabs the remote
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen

Baby baby baby 
Why don't you just get rid of him (Tell him to go)
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend. (That's right)

He makes you cry I'll make you laugh
He rubs you wrong I'll rub your back
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby 

Why don't you just get rid of him (Bye Bubba)
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
Good Old Boy Bad Old Boyfriend.
