
This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God, I'm such a mess
Never a mornin' person, but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tanglin' - her little arm is danglin'
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leavin'
She didn't believe the words I said

I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again

She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See, I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe, whisper my name

[Repeat Chorus]

No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin' 
Back there, again

Now, don't blame her mama - for makin' me promise
Don't come around here, no more
She said, "maybe your life's gone to hell 
But, that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for"

When you can't save yourself, you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm runnin' away so she don't have to see
A life in slow-motion suicide
You throw in the towl - they call you a coward
Tell ya - fight, don't cut and run
I ain't no hero, but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Shoud have become

I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'

No one's gonna make me 
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Goin' 
To break her heart, again
