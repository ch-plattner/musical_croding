Feeling like this could only mean
I'm sinking.
Feeling like this could only mean
I'm sinking.
Well, I'm sinking.
Pull me up.

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor,
I say I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone.
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch,
I say I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone,
But you are.
You are.

Feeling overwhelmed, I take a dive
To a once overfilled but now empty place to hide.
The day you turned on me is the day I died,
And I've forgotten what it's like,
And how it feels to be alive.

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor,
I say I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone.
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch,
I say I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone.

Reach up to the sky.
When nothing seems to go right,
When nothing seems to go right for me.

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor.
I say I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone.
Everytime I see the light not burning on the porch,
I say I thought you would be home.
You never would be gone.
I thought you would be home.
You said you never would be gone,
But you are.
