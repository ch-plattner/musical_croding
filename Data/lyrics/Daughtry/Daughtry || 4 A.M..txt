Yesterday's gone and
Tomorrow's come way too fast
You were my first love
California, my last

Now I'm wide awake
Thinking of you with every breath I take
And I'm up before you in Pacific Standard time
Trying to find the words to write a perfect rhyme
And it's such a crazy hour
But I just can't get you off my mind
Just can't get you off my mind

Maybe one more dream can end
Another trip down memory lane
It's too late to call
But is it too late to change my ways

Now I'm wide awake
Thinking of you with every breath I take
And I'm up before you in Pacific Standard time
Trying to find the words to write a perfect rhyme
And it's such a crazy hour
But I just can't get you off my mind

And I'm up before you in Pacific Standard time
Don't know why it took so long to see that I was out of line
And it's such a crazy hour 
But I just can't get you off my mind
I just can't get you off my mind
I just can't get you off my mind

Now I'm wide awake
Thinking of you with every breath I take
And I'm up before you in Pacific Standard time
Trying to find the words to write a perfect rhyme
And it's such a crazy hour
But I just can't get you off my mind

And I'm up before you in Pacific Standard time
Don't know why it took so long to see that I was out of line
And it's such a crazy hour 
But I just can't get you off my mind
Just can't get you off my mind

Yesterday's gone and
Tomorrow's come way too fast
