
You used to be the girl who set the world on fire
And they doused your soul in water but the flames raged higher
Used to act so tough like you could walk on a wire
And they called you devil's daughter, such a pretty liar
Yeah
Yeah

You were burning like the summer, crazy like a fox
You hit harder than a drummer, like a wave on the rocks
You could play me like the lotto, you were playing a part
There ain't nobody could tame you and your wild heart
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go ´til we die
Take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yeah
To your wild heart
Yeah

You used to be the girl that could light up a room
And with the flip of a switch I bet you still do
You would leave a trail of danger yeah wherever you go
And no matter where it lead me I would follow
Yeah
Mmm yeah

You were beautiful in blue jeans, holes on the knees
You were smoking like a cigarette, I couldn't breathe
Used to rock around the ballroom, dance on the bar
Baby nobody could tame you and your wild heart

[Chorus:]
Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go ´til we die
Take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yeah
To your wild heart
Yeah

[Bridge:]
You used to be the girl that set the world on fire
And they doused your soul in water but the flames raged higher
You'll always be the one to keep me crazy inside
And if you got a wild heart don't you let it die

[Chorus:]
Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go ´til we die
Take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yeah
To your wild heart
Yeah
To your wild heart
To your wild heart
Yeah
