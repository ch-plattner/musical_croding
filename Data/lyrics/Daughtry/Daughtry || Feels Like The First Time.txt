
I would climb any mountain 
Sail across a stormy sea 
If that's what it takes me baby 
To show you how much you mean to me 
And I guess it's just the woman in you 
That brings out the man in me 
I know I can't help myself 
You're all in the world to me 

It feels like the first time 
Feels like the very first time 
It Feels like the first time 
It Feels like the very first time 

I have waited a lifetime 
Spent my time so foolishly 
But now that I've found you 
Together we'll make history 

And I know that it must be the woman in you 
That brings out the man in me 
I know I can't help myself 
You're all that my eyes can see 

And it feels like the first time 
Like it never did before 
Feels like the first time 
Like we've opened up the door 
Feels like the first time 
Like it never will again, never again 

Feels like the first time, it 
feels like the first time 
It feels like the very first 
time, very, very, it feels 
It feels like the first time, oh it 
feels like the first time 
It feels like the very first time 

Open up the door, won't you 
open up the door? Yeah 

Feels like the first time 
And it feels like the very first time 
And it feels like the first time 
It feels like the very first time 

And it feels like the first time 
It feels like the very first time 
Oh it feels, it feels like the first time 
Yeah it feels like the first time
