It's safe to say I'm lost,
Without you in my arms,
So I call your name and I pray you might
Come and watch over me like the pale moonlight,
Until the sun comes back around.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in until I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in your honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.
Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
I wanna be baptized.

And the days and nights are cold,
Without your body to hold,
So I close my eyes hoping you'll appear,
Cause it feels like grace every time you're near, yeah,
Don't leave, until the sun comes back around.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in until I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in your honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.
Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water,
Pull me in until I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in your honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in until I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
In your love I wanna be baptized,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey,
I wanna be baptized.
