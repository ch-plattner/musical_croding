
Lost from the start, I might as well be on the moon
Much colder than I thought even in the month of June
No communication makes ya feel so alone
All we need is patience in which I've never really known

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Every step I've taken has led me here to where you are
But all that I believe in is keeping me from seeing too far
Throwing out the questions, waiting for the right reply
Looking for the answers, tell me will it be tonight?

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical it's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Through the atmosphere I'm seeing
Glimpses of the past I'm leaving
Holding on for life as we collide

But now it's too late, it's taking over me
It feels so supernatural and I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take and I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical it's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural
