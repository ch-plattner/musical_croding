Show me one man that's never made mistakes
Oh,
And I'll pay
All of my time and every dime I made
But today

The best of intentions I lay at your feet
And I need you to see past the worst part of me

I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
Gotta be a better way

And every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Coming out wrong
So baby hold on
I'm tryin' to hit the mark
But I'm shooting with broken arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows

No
I may not be a saint but I've got a heart of gold
Yeah
Oh, like a telephone
Connection ain't clear
But I hope you hear my soul
You gotta know

Yeah
The best of intentions I lay at your feet
And I need you to see past the worst part of me

And I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way

Seems like every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Coming out wrong
So baby hold on
I'm tryin' to hit the mark
But I'm shooting with broken arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows (yeah)
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows
Broken arrows

I'm drawing it back now
And the target is you
And I don't know what else I can do, whoa

I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way

Seems like every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Coming out wrong
So baby hold on
I'm trying to hit the mark
But I'm shooting with broken arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows (yeah)
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows (yeah)
It's like I'm shooting with broken arrows
Broken arrows... yeah
