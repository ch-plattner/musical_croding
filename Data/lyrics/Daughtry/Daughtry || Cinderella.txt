
Dressed in rags
You're scoopin' litter from the cats
I thought we had someone for that
But by the looks of things you fired the maid again

Yeah I confess
I know that floor won't clean itself
And you're worried half to death
About the things that just won't matter in the end

Take off those shoes
Looks like you could really use a glass slipper
Yeah I know it's been a pisser
So one strong sipper might suffice

Come on girl, I'm beggin' please
Get off your knees, I got the keys
And I'll pick you up at midnight
In my souped-up pumpkin ride

'Cause you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight
My Cinderella
Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to say it's forever with you
Oh, I know it's forever with you

Don't watch the clock, 
I paid some dude to make it stop
But we won't worry 'bout tomorrow
There's no sorrow in this fairy tale I wrote

I gotta say
You still take my breath away
That look reminds me of that day
You scratched your number on that yellow post-it note

And now you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight
My Cinderella
Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to say it's forever with you
Oh, I know it's forever with you

Check out those stars
I picked 'em up one day on Mars
And you thought I was at the bar
Well okay maybe there's a little truth to that

As I was sayin'
If you squint a certain way
You'll see they kinda spell your name
Just a little
Okay maybe that's a stretch

But you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
Forever
Or until you've had enough

Cause you're my Cinderella
And I'm your kind of fella
I wanna kiss you there and tell ya
You're so hella good looking tonight
My Cinderella
Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to say it's forever with you
Oh, I know it's forever with you

Yeah, and I mean forever with you
Oh, I know it's forever with you
