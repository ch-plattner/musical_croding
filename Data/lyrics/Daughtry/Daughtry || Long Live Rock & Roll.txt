
Well I was born
The year that disco died
And U2 was in high school
Thank the Lord that they survived
Got my first taste, on a Seger '45
And since that Kiss I rocked out
All day and partied every night

We still argue about who's better
Elton John or Billy Joel
We still wonder if Kurt really
Wrote the song she sang in Hole
No we'll never stop believing
That's the Journey of our lives
So won't you help me Pour Some Sugar
On these memories tonight?

Sing it
Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sayin'
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Summer of '96, I got my first guitar
I played it till my fingers said,
"You're gonna be a star."
Grunge was everything, at least it was to me
A Marshall in my Chevy Sprint
Just winding down a dream

We still argue about who's better
Motley Crue or GNR
We still can't believe Van Halen
Turned into Van Hagar
Now the record shops are gone for good
And no one seems to care
But me and you and all our friends
Keep Living On That Prayer

Sing it
Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sayin'
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Went to bed in Cleveland
Woke up in Tennessee
No matter where I'll roll tonight
I'm chasing history

We still argue about who's better
The Beatles or The Stones
They're forever 27
Jimi, Janis, Brian Jones
And we stand here in their memory
'Cause their songs, they still survive
So throw your lighters up
And, darling, sing with me tonight

Come on

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sayin'
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold

Long live rock and roll
