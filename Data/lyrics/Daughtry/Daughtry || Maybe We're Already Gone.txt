Our time's just another let down
White lies tearin' up a small town
Lost cause, someone's gotta break through
Coin toss, give away your next move
So much talkin', left with walkin'
Is this really what we wanted?
I don't think we'll ever know
Know you're sayin' hell we're payin'
Everything we want is fadin'
Faster than you'll ever know

Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we've fallen
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you callin'
So maybe we're already gone

Maybe we're already gone!

Caught up, temporary meltdown
So what, it doesn't matter right now
Right now, anyhow
After somethin', all or nothin'
Goes right by ya, sends no motion
Why we let it take control?
Know you're sayin' hell we're payin'
Everything we want is fading
And all is lost and heaven knows

Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we've fallen
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you callin'
So maybe we're already gone

Maybe we're already gone!
We'll make it through
Yeah, there's nothing else that we can do

Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we've fallen
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you callin'
So maybe we're already gone

Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Maybe we're already
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you callin'
So maybe we're already gone
