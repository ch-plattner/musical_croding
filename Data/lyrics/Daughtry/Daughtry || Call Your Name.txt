That it would be this hard
Love is meant to be forever, now or never seems to discard

There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars.
So, can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

When I call your name

Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong
And I've been standing in the river of deliverance way too long

There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars.
So, can you hear me when I call your name?

So, can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart

There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
(When I call your name)
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
(When I call your name)

Yeah

[2x]
And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said, yeah
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?
