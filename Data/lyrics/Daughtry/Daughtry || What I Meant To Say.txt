I woke up today sinkin' like the stones that you have thrown
Wounded by the same ole shots you take
It's easier to kick me when I'm low

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry but that's not what I meant to say

I'm strong enough to say
That I don't wanna take the high road now
So typical of you to walk away
When your perfect little world is burning down

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go, can I be so bold?
'Cause all this sucking up to you is just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry, but that's not what I meant to say

What I really meant to say with every little breath I take
I'm not the only one who makes mistakes
Just think of all the ones you've made

And I just thought that you should know
I've been holding on while you've been letting go, can I be so bold?
'Cause all this sucking up to you is just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
'Cause I know I said I'm sorry, but that's not what I meant to say
