Yeah

I’m sinking inside
And the masts and lines are broken down tonight.
I swallow my pride
But we’re drowning in the ocean and it’s tearing my heart open

Baby, we’re high then we’re low, first it’s yes then it’s no, and we’re changing like the tides
Yeah, but I want you, I need you, and I guarantee you we’ll make it out alive

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more,
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we’ve had enough

And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships.
Like battleships.

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes

Bombs fly through the air
And I know that we’re both playing not so fair.
Oh, show, show me you care
I got my white flag up and it’s waving 'cause you know this love’s worth saving, baby.

We’re high then we’re low, first it’s yes then it’s no, and we’re changing like the tides
Yeah, but I want you, I need you, and I guarantee you we’ll make it out alive

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more,
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we’ve had enough

And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships.
Like battleships.

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And we love, yeah we love
And we love, yeah we love

I’m sinking inside
Can we finally put our weapons down tonight?

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more,
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we’ve had enough

And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships.
Like battleships.

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And we love like battleships.
