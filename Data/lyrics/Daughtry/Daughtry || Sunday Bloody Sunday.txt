
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes 
And make it go away
How long
How long must we sing this song
How long, how long
'Cause tonight
We can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters 
Torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

How long
How long must we sing this song
How long, how long

Wipe those tears away
Wipe those tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Wipe those tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Wipe those tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Wipe those tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Wipe those tears away
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Wipe those tears away
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Wipe those tears away
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
