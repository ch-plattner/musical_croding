Is this hour breaking?
Now we're out of time
Changing seasons, a thousand reasons to say goodbye
Have we given all we have to give?
And are we living all the life that we can live?

We take away, take away 
A piece of you and me and just walk away 
But we'll never die
Never die

See it your way, or see it my way or never mind 
Should we keep hurting or keep on searching the other side?
Have we taken all that we can take?
And have we broken every promise we can break?
And we'll take away, take away
A piece of you and me and just walk away 
But we'll never die
Never die

And it's safe to say, safe to say 
We never really mean it anyway
'Cause we'll never die, never die
Never die, never die

Make amends, start again 
Before we go off the deep end 
And turn the page, a new day 
How can we pretend?

Oh, oh... 

Take away, take away, yeah
A piece of you and me and just walk away 
And it's safe to say, safe to say
We never really mean it anyway, yeah 
And we'll
Take away, take away 
A piece of you and me and just walk away 
And with our two worlds collided we may fall 
We will never die, never die
Never die, never die
Never die, never die
