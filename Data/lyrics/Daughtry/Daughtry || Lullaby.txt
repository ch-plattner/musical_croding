
I can't wait to see your faces
I can't wait to hold your hands
I can't wait to take you places
And watch you try to understand
But until I do
Yeah, until I do
I'll be right here waiting for you

I can't wait to see your faces
And I can't wait to hold your hands
When you get here, it's off to the races
And we'll tackle all life's demands
But until I do
Yeah, until I do
I'll be right here singing for you

Soon I will see your faces
And I'll get to hold your hands
I know I'll have trouble trying to explain
The things I don't understand
And until I do
Since I won't have a clue
I'll just sing this song for you

Yeah, until I do
And this is you-know-who
And Daddy's right here singing for you
