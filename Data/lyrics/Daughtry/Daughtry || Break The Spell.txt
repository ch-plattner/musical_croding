
Like a moth into a flame,
I'm hypnotized,
And like a stone,
I'm paralyzed cause I can't look away,

You found your way under my skin,
And I'm tryin' not to love you,
But I hate the way I keep on givin'

Into you, like I always do,
No matter how I try,
Or maybe could it be,
That you're the part of me,
That's keeping me alive?

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under,
I'm so addicted to the pain,
Got your poison running through my veins,

The way you pull me in,
The way you chew me up,
The way you spit me out,
I keep coming back, I can't get enough,
I can't go without you,

I could fight you 'til the end,
But I will lose you if I win,
So I guess I'll just keep on givin'

Into you, like I always do,
No matter how I try,
Or maybe could it be,
That you're the part of me,
That's keeping me alive?

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under,
I'm so addicted to the pain,
Got your poison running through my veins,

The way you pull me in,
The way you chew me up,
The way you spit me out,
I keep coming back, I can't get enough,
I can't go without you,

This feeling is far from sober,
Its beauty buried deep inside,
You're the only one who gets me high,
And I know it's far from over,

As you can see you're the part of me,
That's keeping me alive

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under,
I'm so addicted to the pain,
Got your poison running through my veins,

The way you pull me in,
The way you chew me up,
The way you spit me out,
I keep coming back, I can't get enough,
I can't go without,

The way you pull me in,
The way you chew me up,
The way you spit me out,
I keep coming back, I can't get enough,
I can't go without,

I keep coming back, I can't get enough,
I can't go without, you.
