
I'm not a criminal
I'm not the villain
Yeah this is personal
A drive-by killing

Your guns are loaded
And your lies are the bullets
So here is the trigger
Go ahead and pull it, now

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor...
You put the knife right in my back
Killed any history we had
And now it's war
War

We were just like brothers
And we had each other
We were down for the good times
We were there for the troubles
Like a thief in the night
Broad daylight
You stole my sanity
Now you are the enemy

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put the knife right in my back
Killed any history we had
And now it's war
War

Oh oh,
I should feel sorry for you
Oh oh,
Watching you drown in your denial
Oh oh,
But I can't feel sorry for you
Oh oh,
Watching you drown 'cause you're a traitor

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put the knife right in my back
Killed any history we had
And now it's war
War

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put the knife right in my back
Killed any history we had
And now it's war
War
