I wanna see you run
Anywhere you want
Never let the darkness hold you back
No fear of getting lost

I wanna see you fly
Way beyond the sun
Anything you're ever gonna dream
I pray that it will come

But if you ever fall down straight to the bottom
And you can't get back where you started
Any place any time
You gotta know for you I'll fight
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Where you wanna go
I'd love to take you there
Wish that I could make the road easy
I wish that life was fair
Don't wanna see you cry
Even when it rains
And I hope you don't forget this
You were born for better things

But if you ever fall down straight to the bottom
And you can't get back where you started
With no strength to stand
I'm gonna reach for your hand
When the going gets rough right when it's hurting
I will be there to help bear the burden
Any place any time
You gotta know for you I'll fight
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Any place any time
You gotta know for you I'll fight

Anywhere you go
You're gonna find me
No matter what you need
If you ever fall down and you can't get back
If you lose your strength to stand

If you ever fall down straight to the bottom
And you can't get back where you started
With no strength to stand
I'm gonna reach for your hand
When the going gets rough right when it's hurting
I will be there to help bear the burden
Any place any time
You gotta know for you I'll fight
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Any place any time
You gotta know for you I'll fight
