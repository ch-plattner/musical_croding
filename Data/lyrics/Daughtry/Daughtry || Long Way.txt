
Dusty roads
Hopeless nights
Looking at.. blinding lights
Saw your ghost here tonight
It lingers on and I feel your life
Pulling me back to the place
But the thought of staring back at you is more than I can face
And its a long way down
From where I used to rest my head
And its safe and sound
If only I could turn around
There's no direction where I stand
Just dead end signs and wasted land.
And its a long way down..
To you

Dusty roads,
Hopeless nights..
Looking at blinding lights
Saw your ghost,
Its alive.
It lingers on, feel your life.
Pulling me back to the place...
But the thought of staring back at you was more than I could face

And it's a long way now,
From where I used to rest my head
And it's safe and sound
If only I could turn around
There's no direction where I stand
Just dead end signs and wasted land
It's a long way down to you..
To you
To you
To you...

Saw your ghost..
It's alive.
Lingers on, I feel your life..

And it's a long way now
To where I used to rest my head
And it's safe and sound
If only I could turn around
There's no direction where I stand
Just dead end signs to wasted land
And It's a long way down
It's a long way down
To where I used to rest my head
And its safe and sound
If only I could turn around
There's no direction where I stand
Just dead end signs to wasted land
And it's a long way down to you...
