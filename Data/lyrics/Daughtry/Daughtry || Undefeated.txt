
Ho-o-o-o
Ho-o-o-o
Ho-o-o-o-ope

Swing left, swing right
Bruised and black-eyed, half alive
Bleeding, choking 
Bent not broken inside

And in this world of compromise
I hit every curb, every red light
Trying to keep both hands on the wheel
But through it all I’m…

Still undefeated
With my back against the ropes
Still undefeated
You can knock me down with body blows
But you cannot break my hope

Weak knees, can’t stand
Raise up your hands
Don’t walk away
Been sucker punched but I’m not down
My feet have never left the ground
It’s a fight that I can fix
Like a cut that needs a stitch
And somehow through it all I stand

Still undefeated
With my back against the ropes
Still undefeated
You can knock me down with body blows
But you cannot break my hope
Cannot break my hope
Cannot break my hope

We’re the ones who take the beating
Get back up and we’re still breathing
We are the ones
We’ll take the hit straight to the face
And never look the other way
We are the ones

Still undefeated
With our backs against the ropes

We’re still undefeated
We’ll break these chains
To let them know
They cannot break our hope

They cannot break our hope
They cannot break our hope
They can break us down but they can’t break our hope
