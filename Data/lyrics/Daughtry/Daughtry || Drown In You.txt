
There's a place where you can light the fire and watch it burn
Lay it down and lose it all
It's taken me so far beyond the point of no return
Gave all that I had
When hope is gone
(Hope is gone)

Is this real?
Or is it just another crazy dream?
Someday soon will fade away
Feels just like I'm under water and can barely breathe
Dying in the bed that I have made

I don't wanna drown in you
I'm sinking, then I'm torn in two
So when you see me come up for air
Don't try to hold me down, just save me now
Don't let me drown in you
(Don't let me drown in you)

City pulls me in closer than I've ever been
There ain't no way I can escape
Without a doubt you know that I would tread the deepest end
Thousand years forever in a day
But I don't wanna drown in you
I'm sinking, then I'm torn in two
So when you see me come up for air
Don't try to hold me down, just save me now
(Just save me now)
Don't let me drown in you

Did I bring this to myself?
Can I get out alive?
Yeah, I've given you the best of me
Now you want the rest of me
What's it gonna take to survive?
Yeah!

[Solo]

There's a place where you can light the fire and watch it burn

I don't wanna drown in you
(Drown in you)
I'm sinking, then I'm starting to
(I'm starting to)
So when you see me, come up the river
Don't try to hold me down, just save me now
(Just save me now)
Don't let me drown in you
Don't let me drown in you
(Drown in you)
(Just save me now)
(Don't let me drown in you)
(Drown in you)
