Another year goes by
Speeding as I drive
Felt like I would live this life
I knew forever
I didn't see it change
But I know it's not the same
I'd bring it back, if I could
But I know, I'm not that clever

Life's so short
And it goes by fast
And we can't get it back

The world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
Thought it would never end
Oh, what I wouldn't do
To get back to
The world we knew

Songs can bring you back
Yeah, I remember that
Nothing wrong the days were long
And the sun was warmer

Life's so short
And it goes by fast
We'll never get it back

The world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
Thought it would never end
Oh, what I wouldn't do
To get back to
The world we knew

I remember nights baby, you and I
Taking what we were given
And I remember days
Standing in the rain
That's what I can't leave there
Not a worry, not a care dancing in the rain
That's what I call living
Not a worry, not a care
Everything was different but
We're still here

In the world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
It was so simple then
The world we knew
Hey, oh yeah
The world we knew

Ohh, the world we knew
