
The traffic light 
Waits for you to tell me the tale of a shattered life, tonight 
And I just passed by when you have had the chance to fight 
Or would you spend your last days alone 
Thinkin nobody would have cared 
or known just look me in the eye and see that its a light 
So you're telling me, this is how you're going down 
You thought that I never really wanted you around 
Well you are way off track to think like that 
Coz now you have taken back, everything that you ever said 
bout how Id never want to see you again 
Well this is what I, what I left behind 
What I left behind, what I left behind 
Need a change 
In a minute of my time did I get your name? 
Well you say, that I haven't been asked that in years 
Now I think, the traffic light that stood in the way 
So that I can hear what you had to say 
I'm half way through your story 
Cant help thinking that you're just like me 

This is how I'm going down 
I thought that they never really wanted me around 
Well I was way off track to think like that 
Coz now I'm taken back, everything that I ever said 
bout how they'd never want to see me again 
Well this is what I, what I left behind 

Forgetting about ourselves 
Is like history that dust is covering left on the self, on the self 
The crosswalks make the way for us to say what we need to say 

Yeah, this is how you're going down 
You thought I'd never really wanted you around 
Well you were way off track to think like that 
Coz now you have taken back, everything that you ever said 
bout how I never want to see you again 
Well this is what I, what I left behind 
This is how you're going down 
This is what I, what I left behind
