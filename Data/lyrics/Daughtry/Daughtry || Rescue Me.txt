
Our story's old,
Older than the wind,
It's been this sad for years,
How can we pretend,
When we all know just how it's gonna end.

Rescue me,
In the middle of the ocean,
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe,
Some say its easier to give up on it,
I say it's time to rescue me.

Lost and lonely people staring back,
Afraid to try,
Some of them here, the same as you and I,
The differences are all but left behind,

So I need you now

Rescue me,
In the middle of the ocean,
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe,
Some say its hard to make the changes,
Rescue me and I'll never be the same,

Rescue me,
In the middle of my darkest hour,
Time will tell,
I never really had the power,
Some say it's easier to give up on it,
I say its time to rescue me.

We gotta get out,
How foolish have we been
To say it's all been a waste of time?
We may lose, and we may win,
But like the sun we will rise again.

Rescue me,
In the middle of the ocean,
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe,
Some say its hard to make the changes,
Rescue me and I'll never be the same,

Rescue me,
In the middle of my darkest hour,
Time will tell,
I never really had the power,
Some say it's easier to give up on it,
I say its time to rescue me.

Rescue me,
In the middle of the ocean.
