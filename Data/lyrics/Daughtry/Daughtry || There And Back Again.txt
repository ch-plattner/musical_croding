
Take, take your time.
Smell the roses, but steal the vines.
Don't wait for the hands of time
To second guess and change your mind.
And shine.
Here's your moment to shine.
Shine.

Lay down, my friend.
Close your eyes, breathe in,
And I'll take you there and back again.
No more questions why.
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again.

Replace, replace that line
That spoke to you
And showed no signs to be alive.
So are you livin' or dead?
You have made a choice to hear your voice
Or hold on to what they said.
Now, shine.
Here's your moment to shine.
Shine.

Lay down, my friend.
Close your eyes, breathe in,
And I'll take you there and back again.
No more questions why.
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again.

Back again, back again.
Back again, back again.

Lay down, my friend.
Close your eyes, breathe in,
And I'll take you there and back again.
No more questions why.
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again.

Lay down, my friend.
Close your eyes, breathe in,
And I will take you there and back again.
No more questions why.
I'm not so surprised
Why you have
Been there and back again.
