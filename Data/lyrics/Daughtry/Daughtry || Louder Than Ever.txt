
Heard that song on the radio,
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real life time machine.

You were there in the front seat,
Windows down we were burning,
It was just like a movie scene,
Those dashboard lights,
And your pale blue eyes cutting through me.

Two hearts on the getaway,
Feels just like yesterday,
Young love on the freeway,
Singing louder than ever.

Those nights we used to sing along,
We were living in a love song,
Those days might be gone,
But I hear it louder than ever.

We spent that whole summer long,
You and me and the moonlight,
Chasing dreams in a fast machine,

No way that it could go wrong,
When it all felt so right,
Feeling like California queen,
I cannot forget all of the ways that you loved me.

Two hearts on the getaway,
Feels just like yesterday,
Young love on the freeway,
Singing louder than ever.

Those nights we used to sing along,
We were living in a love song,
Those days might be gone,
But I hear it louder than ever.

I can't help but turn it up,
No it can't get loud enough,
Yeah, I just wanna hear it,
Over and over,
Over and over,

Heard that song on the radio,
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real life time machine.

Two hearts on the getaway,
Feels just like yesterday,
Young love on the freeway,
Singing louder than ever.

Those nights we used to sing along,
We were living in a love song,
Those days might be gone,
But I hear it louder than ever.

Two hearts on the getaway,
Feels just like yesterday,
Young love on the freeway,
I hear it louder than ever.

Those nights we used to sing along,
We were living in a love song,
Those days might be gone,
But I hear it louder than ever.
