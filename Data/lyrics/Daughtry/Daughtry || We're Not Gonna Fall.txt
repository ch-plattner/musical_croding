Its a world full of heartbreak drive by's,
They've seen their fair share of hard lives,
Looked right into the face of a goodbye,
While we walked on the edge of the dark side,

After all this time, yeah,
We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.

Coz when these four walls try to cave in,
And the ground underneath starts shaking,
It's the hope in your eyes that I cling to,
And I hope to god it never leaves you,

After all this time, yeah,
We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.

We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.

Even if they come for us,
Everything it turns to dust,
You and I are never going down,

Bullets and the bombs of love, 
Go ahead and fire at us, 
We are never givin' up,
Ohhhh

We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.

We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.

We're not gonna fall now,
We're not gonna bleed out,
Never gonna break down,
No, No-oh-oh.
