
I've been me, I been followin' my dreams
Tryin' to find the scene where you believed me
I been true, I been waiting here for you
I been patient, understanding and believing

(Every time you turn around)

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around

I've been good, I been doin' what I should
Workin' hard to make a world that we can live in
I been strong, I been holding out so long
And I don't you to forget that you're forgiven

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around

All the reasons you believe what you believe
Never seeing that the truth is a part of me
When all I wanna do is show you what it really means to love
What it really means to love

I know you're standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down

I see ya standing there
Waiting for me to take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down every time you turn around
