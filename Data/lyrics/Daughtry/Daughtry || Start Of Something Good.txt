You never know when you're gonna meet someone
And your whole wide world in a moment comes undone
You're just walking around and suddenly
Everything that you thought that you knew about love is gone

You find out it's all been wrong
And all my scars don't seem to matter anymore
Cause they led me here to you

[CHORUS]
I know that its gonna take some time
I've got to admit that the thought has crossed my mind
This might end up like it should
And I'm gonna say what I need to say
And hope to god that it don't scare you away
Don't wanna be misunderstood
But I'm starting to believe that this could be the start of something good

Everyone knows life has its Ups and downs
One day you're on top of the world and one day you're the clown

Well I've been both enough to know
That you don't wanna get in the way when its working out
The way that it is right now
You see my heart i wear it on my sleeve
Cause I just can't hide it anymore

[CHORUS]
I know that it's gonna take some time
I've got to admit that the thought has crossed my mind
This might end up like it should
And I'm gonna say what I need to say
And hope to god that it don't scare you away
Don't wanna be misunderstood
But I'm starting to believe that this could be the start

Cause I don't know where it's going
There's a part of me that loves not knowing
Just don't let it end before we begin

You never know when you're gonna meet someone
And your whole wide world in a moment comes undone

[CHORUS]
I know that its gonna take some time
I've got to admit that the thought has crossed my mind
This might end up like it should
And I'm gonna say what I need to say
And hope to god that it don't scare you away
Don't wanna be misunderstood
But I'm starting to believe
Oh I'm starting to believe that this could be the start of something good
