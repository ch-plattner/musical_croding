It always seemed that I was sorry for the things that I did,
But never did a thing about it 'til I let you in.
It's kinda funny about the time that I was falling apart.
You came and put me back together, now.

'Cause what I want
And what I need
Has now become the same thing
You've been offering.
As days go by,
I've finally become what you want me to be.

I still remember all the stupid things that I've said and done,
But still, you stuck around with me when all your friends said, "Run!"
Givin' me a name, I found myself inside all the flames.
Becoming everything for you again.

What I want
And what I need
Has now become the same thing
You've been offering.
As days go by,
I've finally become what you want me to be.

Don't tell me you saw it all along.
God help me, I never knew it alone.
Guess I was wrong.

What I want
And what I need
Has now become the same thing
You've been offering.
As days go by,
I've finally become what you want me to be.

And what I need
Has now become the same thing
You've been offering.
You've taken me,
And shaped me to become what you want me to be.
