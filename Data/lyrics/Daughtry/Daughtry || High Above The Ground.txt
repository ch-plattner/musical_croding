You and I both, we come from different worlds
I'm a small town kid and you're an uptown girl
We've both been hurt, we got a few scars
But it don't matter now, we're staring at the stars

When it comes to my heart you got it catching fire
Deep down in my soul I know that I would die
If I didn't have you how could I ever fly?
100 miles beyond the sky

[Chorus:]
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to?
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to night?

Remember that day, we knew it from the start
We've come a long way and we're gonna go far
I see the future in your eyes
Forever and always, you and I

[Chorus:]
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to?
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to night?

[Bridge:]
When we're so close to heaven
Underneath the moonlight, yeah it's paradise
It's gonna be too hard to say
Goodnight yeah

[Chorus:]
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to?
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to?
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we're never coming down
Till we want to
But why would we want to night?
