The truth behind every thing,
Behind every one lies somewhere.
I'm taking it slowly and seems like you don't care,
About little things that mean so much,
You leave me alone while you're losing touch,
And everywhere I go it isn't clear,
I can't breathe.

Because I hate it when,
The fear sets in.
And I wonder when, you'll be back again.

It's like we said a while ago, yeah.
You switch the shoes you still won't change you,
Pretend that you know me,
But you're so unaware.

And I hate it when,
The fear sets in.
And I wonder when, you'll be back again.
I remember when the fall began
And I wonder if you'll be the same again.

We've all been down this road before,
I give it all, you wanted more.
I've only got myself to blame.

And I hate it when, the fear sets in.
And I wonder when you'll be back again...

And I hate it when, the fear sets in.
And I wonder when you'll be back again.
I remember when the fall began.
And I wonder if you'll feel the same again.

We've all been down this road before,
I give it all, you wanted more.
I've only got myself to blame.

And I hate it when, the fear sets in.
(We've all been down this road before,)
And I wonder when you'll be back again.
(I give it all, you wanted more.)
(I've only got myself to blame.)
