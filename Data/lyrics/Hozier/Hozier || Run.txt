I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eyes, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie

Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery

To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she

But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep

Rushing ashore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run 'til you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
