
Hey baby even though I hate ya!
I wanna love ya
I want you!
And even though I can't forgive you
I really want ta
I want you!

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you!

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you!
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you!
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you!

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

Ooo
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

If you know like I know
you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
funked out with a gangsta twist
if you smoke like I smoke
then you high like everyday
and if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
