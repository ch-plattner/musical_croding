
You've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time

But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind

Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die

Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest

Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast

Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside

My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die
