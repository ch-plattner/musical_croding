I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased, our heart beats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you

I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colors like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you
I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you
I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you
