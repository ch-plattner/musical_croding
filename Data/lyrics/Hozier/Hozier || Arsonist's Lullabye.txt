[Humming]

When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices...
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

[Humming]

When I was 16, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me...
I knew the scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire,
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons,
But always keep 'em on a leash...
