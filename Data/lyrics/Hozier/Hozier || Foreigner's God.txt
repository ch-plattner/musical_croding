She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free

Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's God [x3]
The purest expression of grief

Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms

I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

[x3:]
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God [x3]
The purest expression of grief
