Our head was warm,
My skin was soaked.
I called your name 'til the fever broke.

When I awoke
The moon still hung.
The night so black that the darkness hummed

I raised myself.
My legs were weak.
I prayed my mind be good to me.

An awful noise
Filled the air.
I heard a scream in the woods somewhere.

A woman's voice!
I quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands.

A fox it was,
He shook afraid.
I spoke no words, no sound he made.

His bone exposed,
His hind was lame.
I raised a stone to end his pain.

What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes were watching me.

The creature lunged.
I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have.

Dear, in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you.

I clutched my life
And wished it kept.
My dearest love I'm not done yet

How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere.
