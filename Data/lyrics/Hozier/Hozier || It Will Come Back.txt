
You know better babe, you know better babe,
Than to look at it, look at it like that.
You know better babe, you know better babe,
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that.

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy.
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps.

Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to it.
Honey don't feed it - it will come back.

You know better babe, you know better babe,
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe!
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that.

I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to me.
Honey don't feed me - I will come back.

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more!
It's a kindness you can't afford!
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born

You'll hear me howling outside your door.
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Won't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Once you here me howling, once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling babe!
