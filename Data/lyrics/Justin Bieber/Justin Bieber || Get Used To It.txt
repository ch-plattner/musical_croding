Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
Now this is out of our hands, our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

And now my April shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be your fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve
Oh seven days shy of a New Year's eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't going nowhere
Oh no
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't going nowhere
Oh no

Put your faith in me
I'll be all you need, I swear
Yeah yeah
I'm gonna be right here
Yeah

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't the moment I won't need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it
You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it
