Let me start off with the old school flow [x2]
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits I got number one flicks and the number one kicks and number one chicks 
Fast like Gordan and my jams like Jordan and my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboard in and my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune? 
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this 
People in their basements say that I didn't write this 
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this 
Checks like Nike let me give you a good night kiss 
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering like picking on a little kid like taking all his licorice 
I hate it when they littering I hate to be illiterate 
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha and Imma go right threw ya and I'm so much cooler and I don't need Luda to know that I'm the ruler and 
I'm so much cooler you should call me Ferris Bueller.
