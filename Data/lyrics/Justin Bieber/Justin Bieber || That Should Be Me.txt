
Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you
Did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans
That you made with me?
'cause baby I didn't

That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
Till you believe that
That should be me

That should be me

You said you needed a little time
For my mistakes
It's funny how you use that time
To have me replaced
But did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
What you doin' to me
You're takin' him where we used to go
Now if you're tryin' to break my heart
It's working 'cause you know that

[Chorus:]
That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
Till you believe that
That should be me

I need to know, should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart

[Chorus:]
That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
Till you believe that
That should be me
Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby
That should be me
That should be me giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours
That should be me,
That should be me
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
