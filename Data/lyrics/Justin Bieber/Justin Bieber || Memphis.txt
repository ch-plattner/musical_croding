love you, need you
I need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you (woop woop woop)
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass (boom, boom, boom, boom)
She give me butterflies and they won't go away (away away)
Under the stars, she took my hand and said,
"Love you, need you, need you here to stay."

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass (boom, boom, boom, boom)
She give me butterflies and they won't go away (away, away)
Under the stars, she took my hand and said,
"Love you, need you, need you here to stay."

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Sean]
Is this what you want? The baddest, the baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, have to have it, I hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous the stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep asking, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted?
Give you flowers, now you look like you won a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down (swerv)
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
