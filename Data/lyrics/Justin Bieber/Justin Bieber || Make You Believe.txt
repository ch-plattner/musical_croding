
I'll make you believe

[Verse 1:]
I heard you're looking for somebody to treat you right
'Cause them other guys don't live up to their height.
I heard you're looking for somebody to smack your heart.
Cause they going, they shot before you start.

[Pre-Chorus:]
You ain't gotta search no further,
I got what you want (right here)
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want (right here).
They can make you promise in the dark,
I'll make you believe.

[Chorus:]
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
They can make you promises, but I
I'll make you believe.
(Believe, believe)
(Believe, believe)

[Verse 2:]
I heard your looking for somebody to take control
Baby, give me the green light and we'll go.
So let me love you, 'till my heart stops
Let me touch you, when the beat drops.

Right there.

[Pre-chorus:]
You ain't gotta search no further,
I got what you want (right here)
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want (right here).
They can make you promise in the dark,
I'll make you believe.

[Chorus:]
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
They can make you promise in the dark, but
I'll make you believe.
