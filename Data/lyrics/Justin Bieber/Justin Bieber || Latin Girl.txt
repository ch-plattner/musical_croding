She's my latin girl, she's my latin girl

I was on the beach yah
I was on vacation
I was doing nothing
I was just sittin' patient
Then you walked by
You caught my eye
I said who's this girl, she's lookin super fly

Hey miss beautiful
I've never seen you before
And I would like to be the one to show you I am cool enough
Hey little momma what you got on yah
Looking so good that I just want to telephone her

She's my latin girl
Oooo pretty lady don't you think it's crazy
She's my latin girl

Oh she tries to fight but she knows she likes it
She's my latin girl
Saw what I see then she's looking at me
She's my latin girl
Yeah yeah yeah
