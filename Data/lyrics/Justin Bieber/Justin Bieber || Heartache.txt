
What? 
W..Wait
But yesterday we were..
I don't understand

We started out it was perfect
Nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say 
that you're the one
And I thought it would last 
for the rest of our lives 
Boy was I in for a big surprise

With no doubt looking round 
thinking that I'm so cool.
Same place same time every day of my life 
could we meet after school
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy 

Nothing can cure my 
headache cause I'm experiencing 
what they call heartbreak 
it's going to hurt worse 
as long as I stay here 
I know but man just let me lay here 

Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak 
they say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here 

Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door 
The first time when you said forever I'll be yours
Started walking your hand in my hand feelings got stronger
We made a promise

And whenever I leave it feels like your still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I gotta get out of here 
what am I to do when I look up and your not there
(Woaah)

Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It's going to hurt worse as long as I stay here (as long as I stay here) 
I know but man just let me lay here

Cause this is something I can't shake 
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it 
I know but man just let me lay here

Say I'm too young for love 
I got so much life to live ahead 
but, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain

(Nothing can, cure my headache)
Nothing can Cure my headache 
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak 
It's going to hurt worse as long as I stay here(as long as I stay here)
I know but man just let me lay here 

Cause this is something that I can't shake (can't shake)
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak 
they say it's only just as worse as you make it (make it yeah) 
I know but man just let me lay here (just let me lay here)
