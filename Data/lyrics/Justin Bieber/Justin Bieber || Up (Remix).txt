
It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We can make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby believe in me
That we can't go

Nowhere but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what got to fear
We'll take to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

[Chris Brown:]
It's a big big world
Girl I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls
From every ocean
That will swim in it

We make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make those gray clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah I know it's hard
But baby believe me (oh)
That we can't go

Nowhere but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

[Justin Bieber (Chris Brown):]
Baby we were underground
We're on the surface now
We gonna make it girl
I promise
(If you believe in love)
(And you believe in us)
We can go nowhere but up

Baby we can go

Nowhere but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up (I'll take you there)
Nowhere but up
Yeah
Nowhere but up
