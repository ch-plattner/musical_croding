
The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could this be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (how will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know if she feels the same?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna to keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
(doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings....
