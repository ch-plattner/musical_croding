Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?

Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me
The way to your heart

Oh, my baby, baby
I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle
That's where I'ma start

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Our bodies touching while you)

Baby, baby, baby
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me
Be all you desire

Pretty baby, baby
I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now
And I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Kissing on your neck while you)

Alright, ok
Right there, that way
'Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it

Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say no, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in a benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in the bed, baby, if you're tryna snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me, do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what you'd choose
(You'd choose me, right?)
