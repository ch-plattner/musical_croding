Down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (whoa)

[Justin Bieber:]
From the door to the wall
Coffee table, girl, get ready
I'mma put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down (PYD PYD PYD)
From the stove to the counter top
Dining room table, are you ready?
I'mma put you down
(PYD PYD PYD, PYD PYD PYD)

Up the stairs to my bedroom
Light a few candles, prepare yourself
I'mma put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down (PYD PYD PYD)
On a plane, a train, an automobile doesn't matter
I'mma put you down (PYD PYD PYD)

[Chorus - Justin Bieber:]
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
Im'ma take it out on you, babe (PYD PYD PYD)

Form of appreciation

Oh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you ever had

[R. Kelly:]
On the roof (baby), balcony (baby), we don't care (baby) who sees
Girl, I'mma put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down, down, down (PYD PYD PYD)
After the club, in the parking lot
I don't care anywhere you could pick the spot, whatever
I'mma put you down, yeah (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down, yeah (PYD PYD PYD)
'Cause I've been doing forensics
On your body in this club
I can tell the way you walk
Your body ain't been touched the right way

It seems your man been treating you like a step-child 
Sub him out, sub me in
And I'm a get on the floor
And shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering, babe
Have you spellin' out my name, babe
See, I wanna give my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom
You can make me your drug, babe

[Chorus - R. Kelly:]
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
Oh no, baby (PYD PYD PYD),
I'm gunna put you down
Gonna show you how much I love you
Form of appreciation, yeah no ooh
(PYD PYD PYD, PYD PYD PYD)
Oh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'm gonna put you down (PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD)
I'm gonna put you down, all the way down

[Both:]
Oh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'mma put you down, I'mma put you down, I'mma put you down
I'mma put you down, I'mma put you down, I'mma put you down

Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down down

All the way down
