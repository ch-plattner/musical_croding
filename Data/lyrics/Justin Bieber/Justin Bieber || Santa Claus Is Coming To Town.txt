Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

"So it's that time of the year
When you let all your problems go
And you know, you just..."

Shake it, shake it, baby!
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Ooooh...
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Ooooh...

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town...
Santa Claus is coming to town...
Santa Claus is coming to town...
