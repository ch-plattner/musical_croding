
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Walkin' on the beach, with my backpack on
And my snapback on, with the rap back on, uh-uh
Lookin' for a girl wearing high heels
That's how I feel, I feel, I, uh-uh

That’s when you walk by
Like damn you fly,
And I was like uhuh
Ask me where I’m from
And I say C-C-Canada, uhuh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah

Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl [X5]
Oh yeah [X4]

Louis Vuittons on your feet
Take them off and make me say, uhuh
Oh them curves got me going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, uhuh
Let me ask you girl where your mind is
Let me just tell you’re the fliest, fliest, uhuh

Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah [X4]

Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl [X5]
Oh yeah [X4]

(Let's go!)
