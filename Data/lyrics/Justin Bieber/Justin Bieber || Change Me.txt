Girl, I’m ready, if you’re ready, now
Ooh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all the responsibility
I'd go outta my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don’t fight fire with fire
If I’m screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I’m facing
Be like serenity, help re-position my mind
Take a chance, make a difference in my life

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Girl, I’m ready, if you’re ready, now
Ooh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you’re with it, then I’m with it, now
