It's Justin... Bieber

I can take you to a new world
Take your problems away
Tell me what you wanna do girl
Just come right this way
I don't never need a new girl (no)
Cause you're here to stay
Let me show you what I do girl
And you'll never leave.

You want me
Girl, you know you want me
You want me, you want me
Girl, you know you want me right (go) right (go)
Right, right
Girl, you know you want me right

Yeah you said that you love me
Yeah I said that I love you too
Let you know that you're lovely
Flowers for nothing just for you
You know I got you until the whole world ends
You know I got you
Won't you come and be my girlfriend?

[Rap:]
Cause you're scared to fall.
But you won't spread your wings.
You know it's hard to fly.
When you don't try new things.
And I'm a be the one to make you smile for a minute
Put your head down, let it down for a minute.

Baby, (baby) this sounds crazy (this sounds crazy)
Thinking bout you lately (thinking bout you lately)
I just need a... I just need a lady
(Save me)

I can take you to a new world
Take your problems away
Tell me what you wanna do girl
Just come right this way
I don't never need a new girl
Cause you're here to stay
Let me show you what I do girl
And you'll never leave.

You want me
Girl, you know you want me
You want me, you want me
Girl, you know you want me right, right
Right, right
Girl, you know you want me right

I can take you to a new world
Take your problems away
Tell me what you wanna do girl
Just come right this way
I don't never need a new girl
Cause you're here to stay
Let me show you what I do girl
And you'll never leave.

You want me
Girl, you know you want me
You want me, you want me
Girl, you know you want me right, right
Right, right
Girl, you know you want me right
