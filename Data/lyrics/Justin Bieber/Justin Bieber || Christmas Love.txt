
Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
Cause I got your love this christmas time
When the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I got your love this christmas

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up
With your christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own christmas love, yeah

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
Your kinda star, can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
You warm me up
With your christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own christmas love

All the lovers around the world (all the lovers)
Let me sing you Merry Merry Christmas
Merry Merry Christmas (and happy holidays)
And every boy and every girl
Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above
That you got someone this year
That can fill your heart with cheer

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own christmas love
For my very own christmas love
For my very own christmas love
(Give me a kiss baby)
(Give me a kiss baby)
For my very own christmas love
