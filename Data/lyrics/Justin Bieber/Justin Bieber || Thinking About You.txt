
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn’t rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don’t shed tears, girl, they bawl

I’ve thinkin’ ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ about forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ about forever (Oooh, oooh)

[Jaden Smith Rap:]
I been thinking ’bout you and you know I do
When I be thinking ’bout them kisses girl so are you
Man I heard some things, I don’t know it’s true
But people say you really like me and I hope that’s true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it,
A boy will tell you that he loves you but a man will show it
That’s why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause let so much go by you be dancing away
But let’s just have some fun girl
As long as you’re here
Cause when you get up on that plane you’ll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I’ll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment it’s wrong to be scared girl
Is it wrong to be scared?
Cause that’s what they say and every day that I don’t see you,
You slippin’ away,
And all my teachers in my class thinkin’ I’m crazy
But they don’t know that I think about you daily cause I be

Thinkin’ ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)

[Justin Bieber Rap:]
Baby I could pick you up in the roll Royce
Anywhere you wanna go it’s your choice
Every time that I’m away girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I’m nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom now I’m at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that I’ll never stop
They say it’s true love well is love true
Yeah I think it’s love that’s why I found you
Ain’t a second that’ll go by that I don’t think you’re so fly
And I know why ain’t no guy gonna treat you like I wanna,
Gonna be the man that treat you right
Be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right
Let’s go into the night,

Thinkin’ ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinkin’ ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
