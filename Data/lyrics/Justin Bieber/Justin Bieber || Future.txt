[Khalil:]
(It's too easy)
Future, such a great future
Oh, baby, we'll see what the future holds for us
Oh no

[Justin Bieber:]
When it's raining, it's pouring, how do I always end up the enemy?
How do I wake up in the morning? You're not right next to me

[Justin Bieber:]
How could we throw it all away?
Guess I'll move on to better days

[Justin Bieber:]
Maybe there's a future, such a great future
(See what the future holds)
Maybe yes, next time, what if there's no next time?
(I don't know what the future knows)

[Justin Bieber:]
Future, future
(Is it that bad? Is it that bad?)
Future, future
(Live this moment, we'll enjoy it)

[Kehlani:]
When our love has been broken, we can barely even speak
One minute we're so red, the next we're knocked right up our feet

[Kehlani:]
How did we throw it all away?
Guess we'll move on to better days, yeah

[Justin Bieber & Kehlani & Khalil:]
Maybe there's a future, such a great future
(See what the future holds)
Maybe yes, next time, what if there's no next time?
(I don't know what the future knows)
Maybe there's a future, such a great future
See what the future holds
Don't know what the future knows
Maybe yes, next time, what if there's no next time?
(I don't know what the future knows)

[Justin Bieber & Kehlani:]
Future, future
(Is it that bad? Is it that bad?)
Future, future
(Live this moment, we'll enjoy it)
