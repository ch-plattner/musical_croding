
I guess they want a reaction
I ain't gonna give it to em'
Tryn' to get at me, yeah
I ain't gonna feed into it

Ooooh they been persistent
Tryna break me down

Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken

They can't take whats mine
Someone like me is hard to find

Oooo I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping

Whooaa (Hoping it would change me)
Whooaa (Hoping it would make me loose my mind)

I'm too strong for that
Know you were wrong for that
Listen at 4:58, As I cruise on the smooth high way
I ain't even tryna get away, I'm good
Tryna break me

Ooooh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken

They can't take whats mine
Someone like me is hard to find

Oooo I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping

[BLAKE KELLY]
Hoping and praying I really wont make it
All of these things they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me, how you gon' break me. I've been in this shit since I was a baby
All of my life, been driving em' crazy, there go the Blakie, done all them ladies.
Drummin' the Benz, kissing Mercedes, living the life and acting so crazy.
Hidin' from cameras, hidin' the ladies.
How do you expect me not to go crazy.
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends the moneys still gravy.
Whishin' on stars that's why they still hatin'.
Money out front, we never be waiting.
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient.
Its a cold world that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant.
They can't tell Satan whats in it, and they pray for me to be finished.
Haters gonna start trippin', when you don't pay them no attention.
Then the yachts go in my face.
I guarantee that I kill it.
Ah!

[JUSTIN BIEBER]
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
[BK:] No
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken

They cant take what's mine
Someone like me that's hard to find

Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot
