Ohh Ohh

Hello everybody!

It feels like we've been out at sea
So back and forth that's how it's seems
Whoa and when I want to talk
You say to me
That if it's meant to be, it will be
So crazy in this thing we call love
The love that we got that we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you tell me
Out here in the water and I

I'm overboard and I need your love
Pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's to much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My life saver
Life saver
Oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver
Oh life saver oh wow

Never understand you when you say
Wanting me to met you half way.
Felt like I was doing my part
Get bringing your coming up short
Funny how these thing change
Cause now I see

So crazy in this love we call love
And now that we got it
We just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya

Got me out here in the water and I

I'm overboard
And I need your love
Pull me up (Pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's to much (It's to much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My life saver

It's supposed to be some give and take I know.
Your only taking and not given any more
So what will I do? (So what will I do?)
Cause I still love you. (Still love you Baby)
You're the only one who can save me

I'm overboard
And I need your love
Pull me up (Pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's to much (It's to much)
Feels like I'm drowning (I'm drowning baby I'm drowning) without your love
So throw yourself out to me (Can't swim)
My life saver
Life saver
Oh life saver
My life saver
(It's crazy, crazy crazy, yeah) Life saver
Oh life saver
Oh life saver
Oh life saver
Oh life saver
Yeah
