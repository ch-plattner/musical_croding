
Oh oh
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off
What you got, a billion could've never bought, oh, oh

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete, whoa, oh.
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do, whoa, oh, oh

Body rock, I wanna feel your body rock, oh, oh.
Take a bow, girl on the hottest ticket now, oh, oh

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete, whoa, oh.
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do, whoa, oh, oh, oh
