Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

...there's a little hope for you and
