Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
