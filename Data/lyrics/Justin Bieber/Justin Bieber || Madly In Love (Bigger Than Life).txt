
Love is in the air
Candles all around us
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change

It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)

Babe, you are the reason to breathe
And babe, you know you're all that I need
Remember when you took my hand
And ran away (it was just us two babe)
And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes

It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
