[Cody Simpson:]
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in, love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell ya, that you're the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you til' the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect

[Justin Bieber:]
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in, love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one
I'm the one you wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you til' the world ends
You're way more than worth it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect

I take you home, home, home to mama
Oh, oh, oh
