I was mistaken by the way you loved me
We led it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me, yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah
I'd leave but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I fell victim to your style
You're so amazing, girl you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I'd leave but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I'd leave but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you

You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
