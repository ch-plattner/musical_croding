
Walkin on red dirt no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back

Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station
Hope they let me ride away with them

Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say

As I'm singin an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do)

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't

So I turn around and headed to the old run down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back

I watch the upper class men drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them

Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear

My iPods the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to

I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do)

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't

Never get mad enough to walk out
If I do then I won't be gone for long

Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same

That's my mama
Yeah
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away
Run away, yeah
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't
