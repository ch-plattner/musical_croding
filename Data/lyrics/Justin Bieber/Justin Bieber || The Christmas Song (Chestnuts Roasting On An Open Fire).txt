[Justin Bieber:]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (Yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Usher:]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
[Both:]
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Both:]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Both:]
(Yeah) And so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh wooah)
To kids from one to ninety-two (Yeah, yeah)
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas (Yeah), Merry Christmas (Oh No)
Merry Christmas to you!
