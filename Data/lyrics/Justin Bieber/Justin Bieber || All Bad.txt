[Verse 1:]
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried 'bout
Ooh, you know females
And how they like to run their mouths

Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you
(Like you) you (like you)
Misery, misery, loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood (don't let 'em change your mood)

[Chorus:]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad

No, no, I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad

I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, no, I ain't all bad

[Verse 2:]
Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy sometimes be your best friend
Perfect, ain't sayin' that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn

Wanna be, wanna be everything I outta be to you (to you)
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

[Chorus:]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad

No, no, I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad

I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, no, I ain't all bad
