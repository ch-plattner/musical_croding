Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she can never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall, in love
I know you got your wall, wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of, what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
But I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel? Who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone everytime he done wrong
I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song
That I've figured out

What's gonna make you fall, in love
I know you got your wall, wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself

What's gonna make you fall, in love
I know you got your wall, wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
