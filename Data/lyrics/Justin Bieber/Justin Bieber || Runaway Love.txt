You see my baby over here, 
Hit the road,
Where she's going that's what nobody knows,
I need to find her before another man does,
I wouldn't want him to steal my love,

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool.
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find,
The sweet love of mine.
I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

See my baby really needs some help,
Cause she can never stay at home by herself,
She says she needs a little company,
Even if she's not always with me, yeah.

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool.
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find,
The sweet love of mine.
I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

Why can't I find you love of mine,
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind,
How did I let you get away? (Yeah, yeah)

I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.
