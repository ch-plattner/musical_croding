[Speaking:]
Justin Bieber's, Pop star Justin Bieber, denied he fathered a child,
There's a lot of good that comes with celebrity you know that,
Ya,
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight,
Of course,
And you've found yourself under it recently,
Ya,
Some headlines,
Set the record straight none of it is true,
Do you know this woman?
Never met the woman
No,
So,
Alright well obviously this is what comes along with, uh,
Exactly,
Life in the fast lane as they say...

She says she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door,
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl, she wouldn't stop,
Almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
I'm talking to you

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in and she needs to quit it
'Cause I never hit it, so I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines,
On TV, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news,
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
I'm talking to you

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie, girl,
When I ain't never met you at all?
Saying goodbye, but how could ya?
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolish seduces

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl, no
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl
