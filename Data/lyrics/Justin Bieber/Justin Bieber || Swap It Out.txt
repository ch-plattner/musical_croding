Give me all your heart, swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you
Swap it out with you
Come into my world
I'll give my world to you
We can swap swap swap it out

I can show you what I'm talking about
Be obliged just to show you how
Follow my lead, that's what you oughta do
No pressure
Swapping out ain't ever been a crime
If it was then I'd do the time
Throw away the keys as long as I'm here with you
Forever

Eye for an eye
Remember when I told you
Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder
You ain't gotta try, try to get closer

Fifty-fifty deal, let's make a deposit
Simulate the love
Try it 'fore you knock it
You ain't gotta rush
But you ain't gotta stop it

Open up to me, it's all you gotta do
Give me all your heart, I'll swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you
Swap it out with you
You come into my world
I gave my world to you
We can swap swap swap it out

Oh swappin' out will only change your life
But it's worth it the sacrifice
After all what do we have to lose
Nothing

Don't separate our destiny
By separating you from me
These are the terms
That we're made for each other

Eye for an eye
Remember what I told you
Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder
You ain't gotta try, try to get closer

Fifty-fifty deal, let's make a deposit
Simulate the love
Try it 'fore you knock it
You ain't gotta rush
But you ain't gotta stop it

Open up to me, it's all you gotta do
Give me all your heart, I'll swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you
Swap it out with you
You come into my world

Don't be afraid darling
I got your back baby
Oh you don't gotta worry, no
You gotta know that baby

Open up to me
Open up to me, it's all you gotta do
Give me all your heart, I'll swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you
Swap it out with you

We can swap out our love, oh
Over and over and over again
Oh you ain't gotta be afraid
Oh your love is in my hands
My hands, your love is in my hands
Oh your love is in my hands
