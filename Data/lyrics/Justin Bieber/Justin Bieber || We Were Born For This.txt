
(Wh-whoa, oh yeah
Wh-whoa)

[Verse 1:]
Look at all the choices
The choices in this world
The world spinnin' on freedom
Freedom for the boys and the girls

But the boys and girls, they don't know
What love is like
Love is like appreciation
Mixed in a double cup with Sprite

So, can we go
No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is my time
And I won't waste it
Thinkin' 'bout what you gotta say
'Cause I'm here to stay, yeah

'Cause this is my time
And I won't waste it
Thinkin' 'bout what you gotta say
'Cause I'm here to stay

(Whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh, oh)

[Verse 2:]
Look at all the places
Places that I've been, oh
It doesn't come easy
You gotta have strength

And when it goes down
And it's all said and done
You gotta stand up tall
There's no need to run

And now that I've made it
I won't look back, no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me
Yes, I did

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is my time (this is my time)
And I won't waste it
Thinkin' 'bout what you gotta say (thinkin' 'bout what you gotta say)
'Cause I'm here to stay

(Whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh, oh)

[Bridge:]
Look at all the people
Standing outside
So dedicated
Your love doesn't go unrecognized

(Wh-whoa, wh-whoa)

Your love doesn't go...
Unrecognized

(Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Yeah)
