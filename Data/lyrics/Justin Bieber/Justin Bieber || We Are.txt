Happy birthday

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she'll say I'll have you livid
No, they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

It's like you're always looking for a problem
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em

They ain't never had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Nas:]
She texts me "How's your love life?" and "How are you? ", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight
Esco

Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
