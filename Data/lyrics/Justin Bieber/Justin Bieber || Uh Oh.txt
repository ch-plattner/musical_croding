Oh oh oh
You got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Said I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I swear I really wasn't trying to fall in love

Girl when we met you said we wasn't gone rush
Just peed to and see where it takes us
And then there was your smile, Yeah
And everyday get closer and closer
In my arms with your head on my shoulder
Never wanna come down
Cause girl I don't know when these feelings that I have for you
Knock me off my balance can't explain
All I know is
One minute I'm walking and then next thing I know I'm falling

You got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Said I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I swear I really wasn't trying to fall in love

Holding hands and I feel so connective
And every kiss, yeah, I feel so electric
I never stood a chance
You're an angel sent straight from heaven
And through the phone I can feel your affection
I hope this never ends
Cause girl I don't know when these feelings that I have for you
Knock me off my balance can't explain all I know is
One minute I'm walking and then next thing I know I'm falling

You got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Said I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I swear I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I really didn't mean to
I really didn't mean to
Didn't mean to fall in love
Didn't mean to fall in love girl
I really didn't mean to
I really didn't mean to
Didn't mean to fall in love

Girl you know you got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Said I really wasn't trying to fall in love

Got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I swear I really wasn't trying to fall in love

You got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
Said I really wasn't trying to fall in love

Got me like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really wasn't trying to fall in love
I swear I really wasn't trying to fall in love
