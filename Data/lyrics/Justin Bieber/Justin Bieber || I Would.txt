And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah.
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh.

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would

I would build the love of river wide,
So that it never runs dry, yeah
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no.

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need.
I know that he hurt you,
But that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That I'm where you need to be

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day, no,
Baby, I would, baby, I would,

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would.
