And this is the best DJ in the whole world.
His name is DJ Tay James. He's kinda cool.
And you're now tuning in to WeKnowTheDJ radio.

Black rims.
Black body.
Bad girls.
You should act naughty.
Oh that's your girl, I met in lobby
If you're in my section
Baby girl, you here to party.

VIP
You know it, boy.
Make a milli at the show, just to throw it, boy.
Said this goes out, to all the haters.
I'm a young Tunechi, kicking it with pro skaters.

Oh my goodness. (Why you wearing two rollies?)
I got time
and I got money
and I got girls
Like it's not funny.

Honey (Honey)
What you from me?
C'mon bunny.
My, My bunny.
My playboy bunny.
I open the door, walk in the store.
She sees it's me, she says 'Hello.'
I said 'What's good?', she said 'Let's go'
So I took her home, TKO.

Black rims
Black body.
Bad girls.
You should act naughty.
Oh that's your girl, on my Ducati
If you're in my section
Baby girl, you here to party

Never did I think that I would get here.
Now you know I'm flying on the jet here.
I'm a super man, but don't forget, dear.
So I had to tell e'erybody you the best here
(Uh huh!)

Black rims.
Black body.
Bad girls.
You should act naughty.
Oh that's your girl, I met in lobby
If you're in my section
Baby girl, you here to party.
