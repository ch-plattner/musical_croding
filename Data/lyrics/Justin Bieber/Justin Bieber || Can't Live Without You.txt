
I just sit here
waiting for you to call
and then I wonder 
if your even calling at all

So many thoughts in my mind
wishing you could be here all the time

Cause I'm lost without you 
and I just can't doubt you 
and there's something about you
I just can't live without you 

Cause I'm lost without you 
and I just can't doubt you 
and there's something about you
I just can't live without you
