I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place.)

Now Romeo and Juliet,
Bet they never felt the way we felt.
Bonnie and Clyde,
Never had to hide like we do, we do.
You and I both know it can't work,
It's all fun and games,
'Til someone gets hurt,
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space,
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sonny and Cher,
I don't care, I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop.

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
And I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
(Yeah oh no no no)

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space).
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
