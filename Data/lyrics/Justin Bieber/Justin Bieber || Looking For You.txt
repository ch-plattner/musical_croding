[Takeoff:] Guala!
[Bieber:] What's up Migos?
[Quavo:] What up JB, it's time to go to the club, time to pull them toys out man
Let's do it (I'm sorry)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey where the party at? Let's go
Let's ride, let's roll
Yea, everywhere I go, them girls follow
Na, na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight
As soon as I walk in the door
Pretty lady I think I need you in my life
In fact I know I need you for sure

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love in it
I might be the guy
That'll make you wanna fall in love again
Girl, what's your name, happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me and gain love
And everywhere around the world
Don't you know girl that I'll be looking for you

[Hook: Quavo]
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker
(I'll be looking for you)
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
(I'll be looking for you)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
It ain't a problem, baby girl when you're winning
Tell me what you wanna do, would you make a move now?
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feeling, tell me why you're grinning
(Look at her face)
I think you're liking what I'm saying
Do I really gotta say anymore?
(Say no more)
Need to know I ain't playing
(I ain't playing)
Baby what are we waiting for?

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love in it
I might be the guy
That'll make you wanna fall in love again
Girl, what's your name, happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me and gain love
And everywhere around the world
Don't you know that I'll be looking for you
I'll be looking for you

[Hook: Quavo]
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker
(I'll be looking for you)
Looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
(I'll be looking for you)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 B-T
I asked her what's her name - I just know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat it
Take her across the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me (Takeoff)
Hoppin' out the Chevy, steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in the beach with hummer, with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my huh but I bet they watching me
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch calling me call me your majesty

[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love in it
I might be the guy
That'll make you wanna fall in love again
Girl, what's your name, happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me and gain love
And everywhere around the world
Don't you know girl that I'll be looking for you
I'll be looking for you

[Hook: Quavo]
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker
(I'll be looking for you)
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
(I'll be looking for you)
