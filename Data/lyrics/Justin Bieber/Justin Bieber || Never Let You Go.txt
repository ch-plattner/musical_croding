
Oh, no,
Oh, no, oh

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality.
And when you hold my hand
And I understand that it's meant to be.
'Cause baby when you're with me...

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

[Chorus:]
Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin', no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor.
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because...

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

[Chorus]

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Take my hand
Let's just dance
Watch my feet
Follow me
Don't be scared,
Girl I'm here
If you didn't know,
This is love

Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all (oh, baby)
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

So don't fear.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I am here, right here (I'll never let you go)

Don't shed a tear.
Whenever you need me,
I'll be here (I'll never let you go)

Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)
Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)
