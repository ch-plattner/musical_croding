
She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, hate it when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
And throw us all away 'cause it's too much for her
She can't hide away 'cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this life
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, 'cause it's too much for her
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

How can I choose between the two
When all the lights are all I know?
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
'Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
'Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
