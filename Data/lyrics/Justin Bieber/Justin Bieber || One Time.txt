When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we going keep keep climbin' to the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right

[Chorus]
You're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side and troubles -- they don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right

[Chorus]
You're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

Shawty right there
She's got everything I need
And I'ma tell her one time
(One time, one time)
Give you everything you need, down to my last dime
She makes me happy, I know where I'll be
Right by her side 'cause she is the one for me

[Chorus]
And girl you're my one love
My one heart my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one, guy
You'll be my number one, girl, always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (one time)
I'ma tell you one time (one time)

Me plus you (I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
One time (one time) one time
