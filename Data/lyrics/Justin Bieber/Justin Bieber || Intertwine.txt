What's the use of being lonely?
When I'm offering my company
You could be my lover, hold me
I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We can intertwine, we can intertwine
Oh yeah

[Lil Twist:]
Had the whole hood shook when you moved in
Face like a goddess, body on ten
Had to be back in the crib before the streets lights
That was back when you wasn't allowed to have friends
Now you grown up features all swole up
Seen you at the club had me like hold up
What you doing', who you with, what you sippin' on? (sipping on)
Who you doing, where you being, let me take you home
And if you hungry we can stop at the Waffle House
I'm on that shit it's whatever what you talking 'bout
Take that time to get to know me
Cause baby what's the use of being lonely?

Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some time
So I could intertwine, with you

[Lil Twist:]
We could intertwine, just let me get behind
And watch me run up in that thang like the finish line
To end it like it's Christmas time
I eat it like it's dinner time
She said let's do it like at 86
I said let's do it like 69
Give her a bit a this it ain't no way she getting tired
Introduced to the molly now she's amp'd and she's wired
Get her back to the room she said Twizzy is who I desire
I said let's get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
I pay you with attention direct a positive wire
That shit don't need even matter as long as love transpires
And after all that, baby you should really know me
Now you ain't got never be lonely

[Justin Bieber x2:]
Tell me do you really want it?
Wake up in the morning
Right next to me baby, right next to me baby
