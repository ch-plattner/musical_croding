[Hook:]
I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'
I knock on the door, she know who it is, what's hatnin'
She wanna roll, we 'bout to go, what's hatnin'
We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, just happens
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'

[Future:]
Do you wanna scream and shout?
But I don't wanna fight babe
I guess that's why I'm leavin' now
I can't do nothin' right babe, what's hatnin'

[Bridge:]
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me baby we can solve it
Be real with me, no other option, no other option, no other option

Be real with me, no other option, no other option, no other option

We just need forgiveness baby, let me get to business

We just wanna have fun tonight

[Hook:]
I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'

What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, just happens
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'

[Justin:]
Hey love, what you waiting for?
I've been waiting for a girl like you for a long, long, long, long time now
Hey love, hey love, hey love
Don't throw it away, don't throw it away, don't, don't throw it away

[Bridge:]
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me and we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option, no other option
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me, baby we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option, no other option
