Ride, I-I wanna ride
Ride I wanna ride
Ride, I-I wanna ride

When I wake up, I first think of you
I really like you, and I hope you like me too
The sky is the limit for me and you
I could be your queen, but you could be my boo
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you
I wanna ride
Yeah I-I wanna ride
(by the ocean side)
I wanna ride
I-I wanna ride with you
I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you

Whenever I'm with you, you make me feel special
And all my problems, they go right through the door
I love it when you call me baby
(baby)
It's you I adore
(adore)

We could go to the moon, and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you
I wanna ride
Yeah I-I wanna ride
(by the ocean side)
I wanna ride
I-I wanna ride with you
I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you

So lets go right now
Go slow right now
Let the base flow out with that boom boom pow
So lets go right now
Go slow right now
Let the base flow out with that boom boom pow

I wanna ride
Yeah I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I-I wanna ride with you
I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you
I wanna ride
Yeah I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I-I wanna ride with you
I-I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I-I ohhhh whoaaa
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you
