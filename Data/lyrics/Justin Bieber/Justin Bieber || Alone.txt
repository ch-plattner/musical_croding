
We were inseparable (inseparable)
Everything I had to do I did it next to you (next to you)
And the memories we made are so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule 

There was nothing that I could do
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to being alone, all alone
Oooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happenin'
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could've divided my time
I should've fractioned it
But

There was nothing that I could do ooh
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone (alone), alone (all alone)
You adapted (you adapted) now you're used to (forgive me for you)
being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
Oooh you got used to being (used to) on your own 
(All on your own)
