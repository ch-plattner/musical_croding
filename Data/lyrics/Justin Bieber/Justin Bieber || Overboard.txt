
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh,
So back and forth that's how it seems,
And when I wanna talk you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be.

Whoa-oh-oh

So crazy is this thing we call love,
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you,
Get me out here in the water and I...

I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.

Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver
Whoa.

Never understood you when you'd say,
You wanted me to meet you halfway,
Oh, I felt like I was doing my part,
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change cause now I see, oh,

So crazy is this thing we call love,
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you,
Got me out here in the water and I...

I'm overboard (overboard)
And I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.

Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know,
But you're only taking and not giving anymore.
So what do I do? (so what do I do)
Cause I still love you (still love you baby),
And you're the only one who can save me.

I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.

Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver
Whoa.

Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver
Yeah.
