
Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night!
Son of god, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus lord at thy birth;
Jesus lord at thy birth.
