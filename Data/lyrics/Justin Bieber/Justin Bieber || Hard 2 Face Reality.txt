[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality (oh, oh)
Even though you might get mad at me (oh, oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside the door alone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality (oh, oh)
Even though you might get mad at me (oh, oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Any opportunity to stay away for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It is meaning though, that life
Tryna protect your feelins
You read in-between the lines
Hope your heart has started healin' (whoa, whoa)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality (oh, oh)
Even though you might get mad at me (oh, oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
