Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)
Since you've been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call)
If I got you today, oh?

Girl you say, that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking 'bout you all day long
Hoping you'll pick up your phone
Girl I know, that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby (oh baby), oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low

Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart's breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart's breaking

(Hey girl)

Girl you see me standing here (standing here)
Standing in the rain, oh baby
Any chance that you could stay right here?
And never go away?

Girl you say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking 'bout you all day long
Hoping you'll pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby (oh baby), oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go (secret place that we can go)
'Cause I really wanna be alone (I really wanna be alone)
Baby nobody else gotta know (nobody else)
Just meet me later on the low (would you meet me on the low, girl?)

Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (baby don't tell me, no)
Girl my heart's breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart's breaking (heart is breaking, whoa)

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
I know the seasons may change
And sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
And I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that
I still believe in us

I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us
The way I believe in us
You don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands, I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you're feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you're feeling, the way that I, the way that I

You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
With your heart
