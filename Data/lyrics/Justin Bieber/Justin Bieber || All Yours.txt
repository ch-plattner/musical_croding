You know it babe

I could open up your door like a gentleman
If you open up your heart and just let me in
Tell me what you need girl I will never disappoint you
Woah

And if you ride with me I can show you babe
And nobody gonna know you like I know you babe
We can fly away, fly, fly away
I adore ya (I adore ya)

Woah

Walkin around with a little attitude?
Short black skirt, the leather jacket too
How could I ever be mad at you?
When I know (oh, oh)

Yeah

Well I know all about your secrets
Cause you know that I can keep them
Babe how can't you see that I'm yours (I'm yours babe)

And all yours babe (all yours all yours)
And all yours babe yeah
And all yours babe (all yours all yours)
And all yours babe yeah
