Yeah, oh oh

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't want to be left with the questions, why
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do
Yeah

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Trust me right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, we gotta learn to trust right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Girl you gotta learn to trust me right now
Hey, hey, yeah
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love
If you want the best for us
I got the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, woah woah
