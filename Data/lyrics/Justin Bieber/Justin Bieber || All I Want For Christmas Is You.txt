[Justin Bieber]
I just can't wait

[Mariah Carey]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

[Mariah Carey]
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Mariah Carey]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

[Justin Bieber]
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Justin Bieber]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

[Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber:]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air

[Both]
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah

[Mariah Carey]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby (Yeahhh)
Standing right outside my door

[Mariah Carey]
Oh I just want you for my own

[Justin Bieber]
For my own
Baby

[Mariah Carey]
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

[Both]
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
