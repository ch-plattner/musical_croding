The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale (yeah)
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down (no)
Like a see saw lets you down (oh) you know why
Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear,
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby,

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa,
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(don't knock ya earrings) like yesterday
(They shine on me) we were little then
(in class daydreamed about you) my baby
Just remember
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (heart breaker)
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
