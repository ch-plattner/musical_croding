[Intro:]
Come here
I don't know what happened

[Verse 1:]
Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me, and did I lose control?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

[Chorus:]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Verse 2:]
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no fights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason what this happened for
(But I can't help but feel like)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

[Chorus:]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Pre-Chorus:]
Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

[Chorus:]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
