Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away

TV light of blue and white
Just can't fall asleep at night
Move over to the space where you should be
Even half way seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Home is way too far away

All my life I've dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return
So I'll be strong and hold on to
A picture and a thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve

So come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Home is way too far away

If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
