
Where are you now
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand
I want to be close

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free yeah

Where are you now

[Chorus:]
Where are you now
Now that I'm half-grown.
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone

Where are you now,
When nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light.

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be.
I need you to set me free, yeah yeah

I need you
To need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole
When you're not with me

I want you
Here with me
To guide me
Hold me
And love me now

Where are you now?
Ohh
Where are you now?

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be, yeah
I need you to set me free, yeah.

Where are you now?
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh.
Yeah.
