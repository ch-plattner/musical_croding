This one’s for you
Alright

Cause we're California cruisin’
California cruisin’
We're California cruisin’
Look where we got
California cruisin’
Look where we got
Look where we got baby
Look where we got
Look where we got baby

Cruising down hollywood
Windows down, feelin' good, yeah
Feeling better than I’ve ever been, it must be adrenaline
As we're cruisin' down Sunset all night, all night

Cause we're California cruising
California cruisin’
We're California cruisin’
California cruisin’
California cruisin’
Look where we got
Look where we got baby

101 is backed up, Laurel canyon is a way to go
Windows down, matte black truck
I can take it where you wanna go
Venice beach, you can see clear, almost as pretty as you dear
[?] indeed, you should make it clear, roll out

Cause we're California cruisin’
California cruisin’
We're California cruisin’
California cruisin’
Look where we got
Look where we got baby
