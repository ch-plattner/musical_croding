(Yeah, j-j-j-j-b, yeah, whoa oh, whoa noo.)

Now I can see it girl,
You aint gotta say nothing,
Your lips are calling me,
Like they wanna do something,
I feel the chemistry,
Yeah you're into me,
A little kiss is a definite possibility,

Seen you a couple times,
Had a couple conversations,
Since you've been on my mind,
Had a couple observations,
Like you're a fly chick,
You could be my chick,
Play by the rules and you can get what I give.

Just keep it quiet; keep it on the hush,
And what we do keep it just between us,
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B. cause,
The only people that should know is you and me so,
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it.
But you and me girl,
Telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ,
All in our privacy,
Use them lips for kissing girl,
If you wanna ride with me.
And if you wanna tell somebody,
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet; keep it on the hush,
And what we do keep it just between us,
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B. cause,
The only people that should know is you and me so,
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh.

Don't tell your homies,
Don't tell your mama,
Don't tell your girlfriends,
That'll start some drama,
Stay off that facebook,
I'll treat you real good,
You keep this private,
And you can get what I give.

Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa oh,
I'm not about that,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
Oh no no no,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
That's not me.
