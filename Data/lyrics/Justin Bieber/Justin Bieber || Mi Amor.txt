
Travelled all across the world,
Seen a lot of fancy things,
But I never seen a beauty quite like this, (no)
This must be a dream!
So I pinch myself ouch, it hurts man,
Well I guess this must be real
So I'm gonna cease the moment
And tell her how I feel.

Let me take you to Chile or Costa Rica,
Puerto Rico or Colombia,
We can dance under the sky,
Use the moon as our spotlight.
Two step with the right man,
I can teach you how to dougie in the white sand,
Just take a chance and runaway,
Won't you listen when I say?

Will you be mi amor?
Just what I'm looking for,
Don't be afraid to fly
Across the sky!
So let's go, let's go
Baby you can let the rest know, rest know
Yup yup, girl, let's go, let's go
Baby you can let the rest know
That you are mi amor

I got fans from coast to coast
They show love everywhere I stay
Everybody yell hola when the shows over
Still wanna see your face
Baby I need bonita, numero uno chica
Sing to you acapella, let's fly away

Let me take you to Chile or Costa Rica
Puerto Rico or Colombia
We can dance under the sky
Use the moon as our spotlight
Two step with the right man,
I can teach you how to dougie in the white sand,
Just take a chance and runaway,
Won't you listen when I say?

Will you be mi amor?
Just what I'm looking for,
Don't be afraid to fly across the sky!
So let's go, let's go
Baby you can let the rest know, rest know
Yup yup, girl, let's go let's go
Baby you can let the rest know
That you are mi amor

Ven comigo vamanos
Senorita we can go
Wherever you wanna as long as with me
Mi amor, mi amor
We can get away
All you gotta say
Is yes
Take my hand and let me lead the way, lead the way, let me lead the way
Take my hand and let me lead the way, lead the way, lead the way
Take my hand and let me lead the way

Oh,
Will you be mi amor?
Just what I'm looking for
Don't be afraid to fly
Across the sky
So let's go, let's go
Baby you can let the rest know, rest know
Yup yup, girl, let's go let's go
Baby you can let the rest know
That you are mi amor

Will you be mi amor?
Just what I'm looking for
Don't be afraid to fly
Across the sky
So let's go, let's go
Baby you can let the rest know, rest know
Yup yup, girl, let's go let's go
Baby you can let the rest know
That you are mi amor
