
You better trust that voice in your head
That your world is not what it seems
It's not the monster under your bed
It's the one with you in the sheets

It's hard enough just making money
It's hard enough just trying to feel alive
Meanwhile our fever is running
and the kings bow down to the dollar sign
(change)

Well don't ask me, don't ask me to change
(change)
It's Up 2 U

Giants think the world is theirs
Well I got a hand full of magic beans
And there's a rain that's in my head
and if you want a storm come dance with me

It's hard enough just making money
It's hard enough just trying to feel alive
Meanwhile our fever is running
and kids bow down to the bottom line
(change)

Well don't ask me, don't ask me to change
(change)
It's Up 2 U
It's Up 2 2
(ooooohhhhhh)

I can't believe my eyes
got to believe there's someway
I can't believe my eyes
got to believe there's someway
I can't believe my eyes
got to believe there's someway
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
Yeeeeeaaaaaaah
It's Up 2 U
