
The real life love is under the mirror of the surface
So cut my cord I want to know how deep we can take it
See the thing you've been chasing honey
You'll never find it wearin' a life vest
You gotta risk your neck, know in your heart it will be worth it

So here we go head first
No regrets and no rules
We can stay as long as we want
Slow dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

It's been my fashion to keep my head dry and get my feet wet
Step by step I've been letting you lead me towards the deep end
Well I learned my lesson, honey
Just when you think you're all adult swim
Is precisely when somebody shows you to the ocean

So here we go head first
And no regrets and no rules
We can stay as long as we want
Slow dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

Just keep holding on, holding on to me
Under, under the top of, the surface of the sea
Just keep holding on, holding on to me
Just keep holding on, holding on to me

Oh here we go head first
And no regrets and no rules
We can stay as long as we want
Slow dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

Head first into the water
And so it hits me
I guess we could breathe all along
One breath after another
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
