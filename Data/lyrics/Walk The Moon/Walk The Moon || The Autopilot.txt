
Go!

I have a house on the edge of the sea
Built with my hands on the rock, not the sand, and 
The earth will tremble beneath my floor, and 
The sea, she will pound her fists on my door, but 
I will trust the foundation

Oh, I-I-I am an airoplane
I will soar until they shoot me down, and 
If I cannot fly, I trust the autopilot, oh, and 
The autopliot, he never let me down
No, the pilot never let me down

I have a bird that I ride out over the sea
I see colors when it sings
I see holes all in its wings, and 
The wind will howl and thrash all night, but 
Our bones, our bones are hollow and light
Don’t you see I have trust, trust in my bones

Oh, I-I-I am an airoplane
I will soar until they shoot me down, and 
If I cannot fly I trust the autopilot, oh, and 
The autopliot, he never let me down
No, the pilot never let me down

 And the wind will howl and thrash all night, but
Our bones, our bones are hollow and light
Don’t you see I trust the foundation

Oh, I-I-I am an airoplane
I will soar until they shoot me down, and 
If I cannot fly I trust the autopilot, oh, and 
The autopliot he never let me down
Well if I-I-I am an airoplane
I will soar until they shoot me down, and 
If I cannot fly I trust the autopilot, oh, and 
The autopliot, he never let me down
No, the pilot never let me down
No, the pilot never let me down
