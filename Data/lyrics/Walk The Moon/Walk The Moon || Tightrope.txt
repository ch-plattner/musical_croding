Easy now with my heart
Easy now, oh, with my heart

Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
You walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up

Careful now with my head
I said careful now, what you do to my head

Make your mind up, make your little mind up
To each his own, each his or her o-o-own

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up

In my bed I'm rolling over
I'm tangling up in the chains on the swings on the set, on the night that we met
And all the beads of water move up the glass
You speak your mind, you cannot take it back

Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope!
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
It's, it's burning up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
