
Love is so irrational-oh oh,
The more we fight the less I know-oh oh
Well, I want you just as bad,
Oh just as bad as I always have,
I want you just as bad

Can't you see
Why can't you see,
That this is why we're always,
Tete-a-Tete

It hurts my head when you get mad,
I wave my cape and play the mate-at at,
TADOR
Well I want you just as bad,

Oh just as bad as I always have I want you just as bad
Why can't you see why can't you see
This is why we're always
Tete-a-Tete

Tete-a-Tete
I want you just as bad
Just as bad as I've always have I want you just as bad
Why can't you see
Why can't you, can't you see, why can't you!
