
When I come home
When I come home
Oh I hear you washing in the shower

Mirages of you
Mirages of you
Even steam pouring through the crack at the floor

I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it
I won't lose it, I won't lose it

Hold it steady, hold it steady, hold it steady,
Hold it steady, hold it steady

Over top one another:
All by myself
I can lift a car
All by myself
I can lift a car

I can lift a car up all by myself

Over top one another:
All by myself
Up all by myself
All by myself
Up all by myself

I can lift a car up all by myself

So very nice
So very nice
My grandpa's leather jacket and goggles

So you kissed me
On the futon
Oh I hope you like it in Chicago

Hold it steady, hold it steady, hold it steady,
Hold it steady, hold it steady

I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it
I won't lose it, I won't lose it

Over top one another:
All by myself
I can lift a car up
All by myself
I can lift a car up

I can lift a car up all by myself

Over top one another:
All by myself
Up all by myself
All by myself
Up all by myself

I can lift a car up all by myself

Did you did you
Did you know that
I can lift a car up all by myself

Well no misunderstanding
I'm not saying that you came
but you did

I can lift a car up all by myself

I've been going out
And trying to stay fit
Well I met someone who wears your glasses

She kissed me on
My new futon
Oh I'm clumsy cause she finds me attractive

I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it
I won't lose it, I won't lose it

Over top one another:
All by myself
I can lift a car
All by myself
I can lift a car

I can lift a car up all by myself

Over top one another:
All by myself
Up all by myself
All by myself
Up all by myself

I can lift a car up all by myself

Did you did you
Did you know that
I can lift a car up all by myself

Well no misunderstanding
I'm not saying that you came
but you did

I can lift a car up all by myself
