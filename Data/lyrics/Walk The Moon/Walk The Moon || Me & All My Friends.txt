
Am I
Back in line for love again
I can hardly recollect
Who I was before we met

Me and all my friends
Our parents were right
And we're growing up faster than
We ever thought we might

Well, I say me and all my friends
We can shake until the bitter end
And we're back out on the dance floor
She's coming even more
Than she's ever done before

Me and all my friends
Our parents were right
And we're all choosing sides
We're all choosing sides

Well, I say me and all my friends
We can shake until the bitter end
I said, well I say me and all my friends
I said, we can shake until the bitter end

(Let's go!)
Let's have a get together
Let's have a get together
Come on!
Let's have a get together
(Say! Say!)

Well, I say me and all my friends
You know we can shake until the bitter end
I said, well I say me and all my friends
Well I said we can shake until the bitter end

Well I said, I say me and all my friends
I said we can shake until the bitter end

Let's have a get together
Come on, come on!
