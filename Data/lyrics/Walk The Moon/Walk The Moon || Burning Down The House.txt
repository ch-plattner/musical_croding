
Watch out, you might get what you're after  
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary guy  
Burning down the house  
Hold tight, wait 'till the party's over  
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
Burning down the house  
Here's your ticket, pack your bags, time for jumpin' overboard  
Everything's stuck together  
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set  
Fighting fire with fire  
All wet, hey you might need a raincoat  
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight  
Three hundred sixty five degrees  
Burning down the house  
Burning down the house  
My house is out of the ordinary  
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody  
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet  
Burning down the house  
It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself  
Gonna come in first place  
People on their way to work said, "Baby what did you except?"  
Gonna burst into flame, go ahead  
Burning down the house  
Burning down the house
