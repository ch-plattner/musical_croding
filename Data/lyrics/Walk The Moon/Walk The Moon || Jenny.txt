
You got curves like the ocean, gonna take it in slow motion
Got emotions that'll make it last
You got freckles on your shoulder, ammunition like a soldier
And visions, ambitions to be the best

Oh and Jenny why don't we, Jenny why don't we be getting together
I said Jenny shouldn't we, Jenny shouldn't we be getting together

J-J-J-Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, oh, oh, gonna make it last

Jenny, got your number and I've got you for the summer
It's a bummer that things go so fast
It's been a ride like Days of Thunder but these days have been a-running
Like sand through the hourglass

I've been dreaming that we could, dreaming that we could be sticking together
I got evidence cause every time I turn a corner, it's up against the wall
And as the rest of the world fades out
As the rest of the world fades out

I'm thinking Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, oh, oh
Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, oh, oh
But I'm not gonna take it from you, I'll let you give it to me

I said I'm not gonna take it from you, I'll let you give it to me

J-J-J-Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
But I'm taking my time, taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, oh, oh
Jenny's got a body, yeah
Jenny's got a body, yeah
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, oh, oh, gonna make it last.
