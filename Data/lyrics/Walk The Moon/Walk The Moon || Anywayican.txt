Out of your house, you said no
I asked you if you would come out
Give me a hug, but you said no

I'm gonna get you back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
I'm gonna get you back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
Kiss my face, it's so good, can I kiss you back?
But you said no
Give me some, feels so bad when you take it back, take it back.

I asked you if you were gonna make it
Make it all the way, and you said no
Ooh, you said it was gonna happen
It already would have happened
But I said No.

Say, I'm gonna get you there anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
I'm gonna get you there anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
Kiss my face, it's so good, can I kiss you back?
But you said no
Give me some, feels so bad when you take it back, take it back.

And I fall in love every time, oh
And I fall in love every time, oh

[x2:]
I was in the street, you were in the car
I said stop, but you said no
Chase you all the way to the interstate
But you don't stop, you just go.

And I fall in love everytime, oh
And I fall in love everytime, oh

Frown long, I can't frown long with your face in my head
Too long, too too long since I had a smile on my head

Frown long, I can't frown long with your face in my head
Too long, too too long since I had a smile on my head

Frown long, I can't frown long with your face in my head
Too long, too too long since I had a smile on my head

And I fall in love everytime, oh
And I fall in love everytime, oh

And I fall, I fall, fall in love every time, oh
And I fall, I fall, fall in love every time, oh
And I fall, I fall, fall in love every time, oh
And I fall, I fall, fall in love every time, oh

I'm gonna get you back, anyway I can, anyway, anyway I can
