
Oh, Honey,
I forgive you
All that you've been
Oh, you made it difficult

Oh, Honey,
I got no ultimatum
But I wish you well

Oh, Darling,
I've been trying to live without you
All that you've been
Oh, you made it difficult

Oh, Darling,
I wish we could go back to Heaven
But I don't remember
But I don't remember
But I wish you well

I've been singing, aahh

Oh, Honey,
I forgive you
All that you've bene
Oh, you made it difficult

Oh, Darling,
I still got no ultimatum
But I don't remember
I said I don't remember
I don't remember
But I wish you well

Singing, aahhh
