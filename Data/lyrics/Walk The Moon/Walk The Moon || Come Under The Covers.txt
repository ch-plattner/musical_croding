Tiptoe
Down the hall from where you live
These floors are talkitive
But it's alright, it's alright

So quiet
A little house out in the woods
And it would feel so good
If you would stay, if you would stay

Summer is over
And I wanna leave you satisfied
Summer is over
And I can feel the cold changing us inside
Come under the cover
'cause I wanna leave you satisfied tonight

In the low light
Two white shadows become one
Come on, put your moon in my sun
And set me on fire, set me on fire

Summer is over
And I wanna leave you satisfied
Summer is over
And I can feel the cold changing us inside
Come under the cover
'cause I wanna leave you satisfied tonight

Sometime
It's like you grew up down the street
It's such a mystery
The way you know me, the way you know me

Summer is over
And I wanna leave you satisfied
Summer is over
And I can feel the cold changing us inside
Come under the cover
'cause I wanna leave you satisfied tonight
Summer is over
Summer is over
Summer is over
