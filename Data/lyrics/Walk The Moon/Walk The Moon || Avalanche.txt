
Eighteen thousand year old soul
Midwest shooting star
In the place she waits
But she moonlights rock and roll
Playing a rain dance with her guitar
Sometimes you only get one chance

You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't wanna wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

Last call and everybody's watching
Her voice rings out like a storm
Sometimes the past echoes in the future
Starting long before we were born
Sometimes you only get one chance

You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't wanna wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

(Hey, don't wait)
The universe won't wait for you
(wait, don't wait)
It's do or die, what you gon-gon-gonna choose

You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

You got a look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't wanna wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
