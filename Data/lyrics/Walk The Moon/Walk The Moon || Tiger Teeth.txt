If you come around, come around again
You better not come in, better stay outside
Cause I can't hold my ground, can't hold my ground I can't
Not if you look me in, look me in my eyes

Tiger in my heart again
When you swallow someone whole, you are bound to choke
Well, I guess we can never be friends
I ate you up the day we first spoke

Don't you call me on the telephone
Don't make plans with my friends
I think that it's best for you to leave me alone
When I'm with you I just want to play pretend

If you take one step closer
I can reach the zipper of your dress
We're leaning out over the water
And we're holding our breath

Tiger in my heart again
When you swallow someone whole, you are bound to choke
Well, I guess we can never be friends
I ate you up the day we first spoke

Give in, give in. I want you back
One heart, one too many to stomach
Love bites so deep, and we got tiger teeth
Give in, give in. I want you back
Keep count, one too many to stomach
Love bites so deep, and we got tiger teeth

Is this just a moment of madness?
Or have we really found the home
Well I'm wild and I'm rabid
And I ate you up the day we first spoke

Give in, give in. I want you back
One heart, one too many to stomach
Love bites so deep, and we got tiger teeth
Give in, give in. I want you back
Keep count, one too many to stomach
Love bites so deep, and we got tiger teeth
