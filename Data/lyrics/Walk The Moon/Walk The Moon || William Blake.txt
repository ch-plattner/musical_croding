Oooooooh Ohh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh Ohh
I walk through the fog
And kiss her through the fence
Oh, how strange and difficult
Feigning innocence is
But show me
I'm 17 and you don't know me
I'm drinking wine with all the girls
They tuck me in, their bedtime stories
Just before we
Oooooooh
Oooooooh Ohh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh Ohh
I'll come to her house
She'll lay me down
Oh how strange and beautiful
My love, it sounds
I try try try try tryy
To be qui- qui- qui-et
Your da da da daddy's down
But I I I I don't care at all
Show me
I'm 17 and you don't know me
I'm drinking wine with all of the girls
If shes your baby
I cant be bothered
When she hollers
Oooooooh
Oooooooh Ohh
I trr try try try 
To be qui- qui- quiet
Oooooooh
Oooooooh ohh
I'm 17, though you don't know 
You can own me for tonight
You tuck me in, your bedtimes stories
Just before we ooooh
Show me, I'm 17
And you don't know me I'm drinking wine with all of the shows
They tuck me in
Tell bedtime stories
Just before we show me
I'm 17 and she don't know
She can't own me for tonight
If she's your baby
I cant be bothered
When she hollers
Only one thing
(Only one thing)
