
Coming up slowly, oh, sun over the hill
Daylight's still a long time coming
But I know it will
Been under this spell, oh, but we're coming awake
So we'll be rude, we'll be loud
As long as it takes

This is why, this is why, 
We crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Sing

Different colors
We carry each other
We're just different colors 
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

We keep cranking the music up
Driving through our towns
But they don't wanna hear
They want us to turn it down
So come on lovers, come on haters
Tonight we raise the fire
Cause when the people get to dancing
They forget about taking sides

This is why, this is why, 
We crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Sing

Different colors
We carry each other
We're just different colors 
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

(For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction)
(Opposite, opposite reaction)

We're coming awake, out of your spell, 
As long as it takes, we're coming awake

We're coming awake, out of your spell, 
As long as it takes, we're coming awake

This is why, this is why, 
We crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

I said, this is why, this is why
We're tearing it up all night
Oh this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Different colors
We carry each other
We're just different colors 
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Different colors
We carry each other
(Oh yeah)
We're just different colors 
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
