
We feel the rising sun release the day to us, 
the dreamers. 
We seize it in our hands and burn ourselves, 
We know no better. 

Don't take me back if you don't want to. 
Don't take me back. 
I said, don't take me back if you don't want to.
I won't come home, 
I won't come home. 
Don't take me back if you don't want to. 

We felt the sun beat down the day 
we gave ourselves to each other.
And your heart broke like the dawn, 
but I was blind to see the sunlight.  

Don't take me back if you don't want to. 
Don't take me back. 
I said, don't take me back if you don't want to.
I won't come home, 
I won't come home. 
Don't take me back if you don't want to. 

Ooooooooh, woaaaahhh. 
Lover, won't you let me come home,
I never had a home before. 

Your eyes broke like the dawn 
when you opened them for me, that September.
Then you gave yourself to me, 
it was like I had died, 
it was like the first time. 
It was nothing like the first time. 

Don't take me back if you don't want to. 
I said, don't take me back. 
Oh, don't take me back if you don't want to. 
I won't come home,
I won't come home. 
Don't take me back if you don't want to.  
Don't take me back if you don't want to. 

Don't take me back.
I said, don't take me back if you don't want to.
I won't come home, 
I won't come home. 
Don't take me back if you don't want to. 

Your heart broke like the dawn, 
but I was blind to see the sunlight.
