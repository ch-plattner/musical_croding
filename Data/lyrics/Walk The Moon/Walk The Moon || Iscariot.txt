
Until now, I knew this of myself
That if you had thrown yourself down
Into the lion's den
My brother I'd follow you in
Perhaps I lack some foresight (should have known)
But brother you were so right
Sure as the setting sun
You can't trust just anyone

That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more
You had it coming

I never imagined you dead (I never)
But tell me, are you even aware
That all that we did, you undo?
Iscariot, you fool

That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more
You had it coming

That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more
You had it coming

Oh, you know you had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You had it coming

Oh, my brother

Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, brother, my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, brother, my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You had it coming.
