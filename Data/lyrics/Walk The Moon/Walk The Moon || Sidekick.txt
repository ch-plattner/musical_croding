
We walk out the cinema
About to go our separate ways
And I, I almost wave you back
When you let your hair fall in your face

And I often wonder why the things that I want are so hard to find
But I often fail to see the things that I need are right here by my side.

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me dangerous thoughts, like

...Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?
(Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?)
Why don’t you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick?

Keys left hanging in your door
A trail of shoes and winter coats
We’re kissing on that kitchen floor
Our friendship up against the ropes

And don’t you wonder why the things that you want are so hard to find?
Well it just occurred to me the one that I need could be right here by my side.

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me wicked thoughts, like

Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?
(Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?)
Why don’t you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my?..
Do you want to be my?..

WOO!
Do you want to be mine?

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is telling me you could be my...

...sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick?
Do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick?
If so, come on let’s go!

Ay ay ay ay! [2x]
