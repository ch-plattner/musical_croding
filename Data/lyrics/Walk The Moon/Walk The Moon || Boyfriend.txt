(Do you have a boyfriend)

In slow motion across the room
Little London jeans
Search my memory banks for what to do
I recall '80s movie scenes

Breakfast Club
Fast Times
And I still don't know what girls like
I'll take my chances, James Bond
I'll pull my chute and hope it works right

Gotta make a good impression
But I knew the very first second
I've only got one more question
Do you have a boyfriend?

D-D-D-Do you have a boyfriend?

You could be my number one
Mixtape Queen
We could have some dirty fun
In my Jurassic Park jeep

Dirty Dancing
First Kiss
How good is our chemistry
body language
breath mints
watch your lips as you speak to me

Gotta make a good impression
But I knew the very first second
I've only got one more question

Do you have a boyfriend?

D-D-D-Do you have a boyfriend?

Oh, and all these confessions
My implications
without a little information

Gotta make a good impression
But I knew the very first second
I've only got one more question
Do you have a boyfriend?

D-D-D-Do you have a boyfriend?
