
My eyes are on the road
But my mind is on your body
My hand is on the stick shift
And your hand is on my hand

My eyes are on the road
But my mind is on your body
My hand is on the stick shift
And your hand is on my hand

Well push me honey to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line

City in the rear view
And nothing in the distance
We laugh at all the talk
What do you think of getting lost?
What do you think of you and me?
This lion is in the garden
Let's go way back when
Before this ever started

Well push me honey to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line

When the city shines like the sun at night
And I feel it in my heart and my hips, I feel it
Won't you stay shot gun until the day I die?
Stay shotgun until the day I die

I'll stay by you
I'll stay by you oh oh
I'll stay by you
I'll stay by you oh oh

Well push me honey to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right
We've been waiting but we're next in line

When the city shines like the sun at night
And I feel it in my heart and my hips I feel it
Won't you stay shot gun until the day I die?
Stay shotgun until the day I die

Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I, day I,
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?
