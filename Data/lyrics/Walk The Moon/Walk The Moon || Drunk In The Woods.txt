Falling in line,
And I'm drunk in the woods,
You find me in the clearing,
Like I hoped that you would,
Careful as we cross, stones in the creek,
Let your body go when you fall, fall on me
Mmm, In the morning,
You stand me up
Looking down and over,
Would you wait on me hon,
Careful as we cross, stones in the creek
Let your body go when you fall, fall on me
Careful as we cross, stones in the creek,
Let your body go when you fall, fall on me
You fall on me,
Fall on me, fall on me
Careful as we cross, stones in the creek
Let your body go when you fall, fall on me
La da la da la da da la da da,
La da la da la da da la da da
La da la da la da da la da da
Let your body go, when you fall, fall on me
