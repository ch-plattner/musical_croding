Don't wanna wait till the mornin'
Don't wanna wait till the mornin' comes
You know the bigger picture changes when your colors run

I got my hand in my pocket
And there's a diamond at my finger tips
Don't wanna wait till mornin' you and I live for this

I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes, there's sun on my skin
I am brand new
We shout at the cops, we howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don't you get it

We are the kids that you never can kill,
you never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't but you know that we will,
you know that we will keep on

Don't wanna wait fo permission
We got our own fresh set of rules
We take that old school fashion
Shape it into something new

You got your hand in my pocket
You like to dance with my finger tips
Don't gotta wait for permission
You and I we live for this
You know we live for this

We are the kids that you never can kill,
you never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't but you know that we will,
you know that we will keep on

I said, we are the kids that you never can kill,
you never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't but you know that we will,
you know that we will keep on

Lost boys, lost girls, hot tires, wild animals
We won't live forever
Hand over the future I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes, there's sun on my skin
I am brand new
We shout at the cops, we howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don't you get it

We are the kids that you never can kill,
you never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't but you know that we will,
you know that we will keep on

I said
We are the kids that you never can kill,
you never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't but you know that we will,
you know that we will keep on

Come on, hand over the future 
Lost boys, lost girls don't hand over the future, hand over the future
