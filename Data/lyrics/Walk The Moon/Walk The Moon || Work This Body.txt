
It was a strange place and a tender age; I was just a babe in school
Saw them roll their eyes at me everytime that I thought that I was cool
Well uh God knows I was no chosen one that just wasn't my prime
Yeah it's just matter of time, honey, it's just a matter of time

And I will work this body I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square

Show me what you got
Work this body on the floor
Just who do you think you are
C'mon meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!

It ain't no matter of "if", honey, it's just a matter of "when"
Ah, some sunday when it's my face in the newspaper again
All the rag magazines, black limousines, they'll be getting in line
Yeah it's just a matter of time, honey, it's just a matter of time

And I will work this body I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square

Show me what you got
Work this body on the floor
Just who do you think you are
C'mon meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!
Ne vient pas pleurer...
Vers moi...

[Instrumental]

And I will work this body I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square

And I will work this body I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square
Yeah
