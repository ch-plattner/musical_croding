I saw a glimpse, a shimmer a shadow
Or something I had once
But since lost and now I
I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore

Don't even tell me where we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where we are going
Just walk, just walk by my side

It starts with a glimpse, a shimmer a shadow
Or something I had once
But since lost and now I
I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore

The salt in my eyes
As I clear the border
Imaginary lines
Shatter & shimmer
I get to you to ask you a question
I get to you to find out for certain
Are you fixin'...

Don't even tell me where we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where we are going
Just walk, just walk by my side

Are you fixin'
to come with me?
Are you fixin'
to fix me?

Don't even tell me where we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where we are going
Just walk, just walk by my side
