
When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being

Nobody else
nobody else
Nobody else
Has you down, but me

I behold the beauty
But the beauty got a hold on me
With all the other boys in the running
Never thought this could happen at 20

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
Has you down, but me

When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
Has you down
Has you down
Has you down, but me

Singing a ooooohhhh
I've been singing a ooooohhhhh
I've been singing a ooooohhhhh
