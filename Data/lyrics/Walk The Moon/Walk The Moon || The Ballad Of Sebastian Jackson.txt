
Working hard and dreaming heavy
So Sebastian waits with faded breath tonight 
Singin' ooh, I am a man on the moon, oh yeah
And I'm gonna fly, if I can just jump high enough

'Cause he's breaking his back just to see that day 
And it's taking him back to his childhood days 
Never been so close to the stars before
And they're all laughing cause they think he's crazy
Did you know 'Bastian's talking in his sleep all night?

Singin' ooh I am a man on the moon, oh yeah
And I'm gonna lift off, if I can just jump high enough

Oh, Mr. Jackson, why don't you step away from the edge,
Before you wind up dead?
But he says "Oh, no, thanks for asking I'd rather be the same lad, the same
So get out of my head"
He's wishing with his everything and breathing heavy
And with one jump Sebastian Jackson takes his life

Singin' ooh, I am a man on the moon, oh yeah
And I'm gonna fly, if I can just jump high enough

'Cause he's breaking his back just to see that day 
And it's taking him back to his childhood days 
Never been so close to the stars before
Wondering every day that he wakes, could this be the day?

Singing oooohh, the man on the moon,
I'm gonna lift off if I can just jump high enough.
Ohhhh, the man on the moon, I'm gonna fly,
Just spread my wings and fly, I'll fly alright.

I'm gonna fly
