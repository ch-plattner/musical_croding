Let me know
And I'll come and save ya

Big bad wolves can try to take you from me 
It don't matter If they sink their teeth deep into me.
I'll never let you go.

You should know I'm no superhuman
I got power in a little secret

Big bad wolves can try to take you from me 
It don't matter If they sink their teeth deep into me.
I'll never let you go.

Ha, and I'm tellin' you all
When you find it, you gotta fight for it 
Harder than anything.
And when you get yours, hold on tight to it 
Faster than anything.

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh
I'll never let you go
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh
I'll never let you go
