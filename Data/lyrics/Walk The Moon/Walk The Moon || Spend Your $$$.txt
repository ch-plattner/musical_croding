
The TV says Mother is hurting
That the clock reads quarter to twelve
So I shop my face off at Urban
just trying to look a little more like myself

What do you spend your money on?
I hope it's something of value
What do you spend your money on?

The first time to your apartment
I was peeking in between my fingers
Oh the things I hoped we had in common
Wishful thinker

What do you spend your money on?
I hope it's something of value
Are you the driver or is someone driving you?
What do you spend your, spend your
What do you spend your money on?

You take me up to the party
and we cross right over the barrier
I'm not sure what's more disarming
than fake breasts and miniature terriers

What do you spend your money on?
