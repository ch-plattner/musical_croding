Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Yea yea yea
Meet me in the parlor
When no one is around
You'll wear a blue dress
And I'll take your hand down
Meet me in the parlor
One off the shoulder
We got early classes
But don't let it shake you
No no no no
I promise I'll wake you
Hey!
Open up my shirt
And take me in your hands
Now
I want to touch you babe
Until it knocks you out
Let's cross the interstate
Into the fields
And find our way back
In the dark
I'll take my chances
With you
While we are young
Let's get in my ride
And if you'd like to blow your
Mind
And take a drive to no where
We could listen to the white
Album
And sing
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Yea yea yea

Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Yea yea yea
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Yea yea yea
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Yea yea yea
Living in our time
Our time is not an object
So won't you open up
Your eyes
And let me swim on in
Meet me in the parlor
When no one is around
It smells just like last year
Show me your anger
Hit me like you used to
We're no longer
In danger
