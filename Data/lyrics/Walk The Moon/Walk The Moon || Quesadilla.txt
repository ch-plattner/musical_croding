
I must've tumbled out of a plane
Cause I free-fell all year
My chute is blooming out like spring
And I'm nowhere now, but here

But I've seen your long hair come down
It turned my head inside out
And I want you, I want you
I still do

Your wrists were bound in my hands
Water washed around our naked feet
Your blue jeans over in the sand
And we were wrestling in our picnic blanket sheets

But I've seen your long hair come down
(seen your long hair come down)
It turned my head inside out
(turned my head inside out)

And I want you, I want you
I still do
I still, I still do

I've seen your long hair come down
And it turned my head inside out
When I've seen your long hair come down
Turned my head inside out
