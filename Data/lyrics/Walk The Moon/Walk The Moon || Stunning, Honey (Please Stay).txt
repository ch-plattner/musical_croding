
The rain came and we came down.
The sheets beneath and the heat all around.
And my body was jaded, say she aided,
and in your arms I hummed myself to sleep.

The sun came out, and we came down.
We watched the dawn, fell asleep to the sounds.
And when you woke, you softly spoke,
and I could not reply for the life in me.

Stunning, Honey, may you say the words I love you.
Listen, dresser, dreaded feeling.
Falling honey, when you say the words I love you.
There’s nothing else you could do to please me...

Please stay...
Please stay...

They came again, so did you.
The thunder roared and you did that too.
The lightening struck and the room lit up,
and I saw this goddess over me.

Stunning, Honey, may you say the words I love you.
Listen, dresser, dreaded feeling.
Falling honey, when you say the words I love you (I love you).
There’s nothing else you could do to please me...

Please stay...
Please stay...

1, 2, 3, 4

Stunning, Honey, may you say the words I love you.
Listen, dresser, dreaded feeling.
Falling honey, when you say the words I love you (I love you).
There’s nothing else you could do to please me...

Please stay... [x6]
