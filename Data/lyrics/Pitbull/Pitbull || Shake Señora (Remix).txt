Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

My girl's name is Señora
I tell you friends I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother!
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

You can talk about Cha-Cha
Tango, Waltz, or de Rumba
Señora
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to de bridle!

(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Rock your body, child!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Somebody, help me!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time (Whoa)
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line (Yep)
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

Señora, she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket!

(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Hoist those skirts a leetle higher!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Up the chim-en-y!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Whoa oh oh oh!

[Instrumental Break]

Shake, shake, shake, Señora
Shake your body line
Work, work, work, Señora
Work it all the time
Dance, dance, dance, Señora
Dance it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora
Work it all the time

Señora dances Calypso
Left to right is de tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion

(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Somebody, help me!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in de line, rock your body in time) Whooooa!

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora!
