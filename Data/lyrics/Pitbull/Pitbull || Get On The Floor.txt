[Chorus repeat 2x]
Ohh 
Girl you better (ohh)
St-Stop playin (ohh)
Bitch what'cha waitin for 
Get your ass on the floor 

You know the night was good
When you wake up in the morning
With a cloudy piss
You know how i do
Gimme the vodka skip the cris
Im at the bar feelin like 50 takin like 9 shots
I got like 9 broads takin em with me why stop
Now im bouncin from broad to broad
This thing is thick from wall to wall
Ive never read the book
But its like i mastered the art of war
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage
Cuz ive had a couple of drinks think again
Ill have you like kanye west 
With a brand new jaw and a metal chin

[Chorus rp 2x]

Excuse me im takin over
Im sick like ebola
I dont know what they told ya
But bitch this chico's a soldier
Get the crip and roll up
Or drop the E and roll out
Most of these busta's fold up
When its time to thug out
Imma take it to the club 
Where them freaks be takin it off and backin it up
Imma make ya so hot as soon as these mami's walk in they ready to fuck
Every (every) body (body) listen (listen) closely
Cuz imma do whats never been done
The games been fucked but its never been sprung

[Chorus rp 2x]

Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh 
Get your ass on the floor
Ohh Ohhh  
Get your ass on the floor
Ohh Ohh 
Get your ass on the floor
Ohh Ohh Ohh 
Get your ass on the floor

Ohh 
Girl
Ohh 
St-Stop playin (ohh)
Bitch what'cha waitin for
Get your ass on the floor [rp 2x]
