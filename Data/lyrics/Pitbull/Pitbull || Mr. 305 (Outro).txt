To all the DJ's out there I appreciate the love
Let's show 'em why Pitbull one of the rawest (Mr. 305)
I'm one of the best, one of the rawest
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
Barely made high school, the streets was my college
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
I've worked everything, every drug you name it
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment
Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen
Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen
Now it's cartoons and tv shows
First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores
I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind),
That's why they call me Mr. 305
