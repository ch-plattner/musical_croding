Someone point me to the nearest park
Let's have some fun

I mind my business like (whistle)
Waiting his clock to strike (whistle)
(It's a celebration)

Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11: 59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes 12
So I can jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump
Everybody jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump

I'm a live it up
Today I don't give a what
Let me re-phrase that
Today I don't give a fuck
I just wanna jump jump like I'm a dunk dunk
I'm bout to dribble all through here
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 like it's the new year

It's my day first time, I want all my shine
Even though I won't remember at all
I'll probly end up in a broll
I'm going toe to toe with the wall

Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11: 59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes 12
So I can jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump
Everybody jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump

We shut down Times Square, extra extra read all about it
New year, it's our year, to be clear, we here
Immigrant parents but I'm living the American dream for them now
It's it's it's about to go down
This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
Up in the sky drinking poly loddy doddy
I don't need a Maybach or Buggati
Couple of beds and some sheets, that's a party
Go DJ, blow the speakers
All my women wear heels, no sneakers
Grim reaper, the night is mine
Meet me at 11: 59

Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11: 59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes 12
So I can jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump
Everybody jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump

I think I'll fuck the track now

I want everybody to put their glasses in the air right now
And now that you got em up

Not let's make a toast
Put em higher now, get em so much higher for me
Not let's make a toast
Reach for the sky right now for it's so much higher than me

Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11: 59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes 12
So I can jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump
Everybody jump jump jump jump jump jump
I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump
