[Intro]
Mr. 305, Dario G, TKZee

[Chorus]
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me 
(This is for the world)
Just come on and play with me 
(This is for the glory)

[Verse 1]
Freak is pumpin', five's accomplish
Sky is Eclipse, sunshine and only
Kiss our pray, and i hear them scream
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me

Are you wanted, is the failin'? 
All we want, is the top of the fighting
Let them screaming, don't repeat em'.
Concentrate on your left, cause you need it

One two three, We're rock on the floor
Watching here you now, just to fake our zone
Get it you know, 
Get it you know

[2nd Chorus]
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me 
Just come on and play with me 
(This is for the world)
(This is for the glory)
We got the game on

This is for the world (Ladies and..)
This is for the glory (Mr. Worldwide)
This is for the world 
(I want everybody to united and show the power)
This is for the glory (Of the world, win is together)

[Verse 2]
Pretty shine, the shine and only
Every night, the star above me
Kiss our pray, and i hear them scream
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me

Are you wanted, is the failin'? 
All we want, is the top of the fighting
Let them screaming, don't repeat em'
Concentrate on your left, cause you need it

One two three, We're rock on the floor
Watching here you now, just to fake our zone
Get it you know, 
Get it you know
We got the game on

[3rd Chorus]
This is for the world
This is for the glory
(We got the game on)
This is for the world
This is for the glory
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the glory

[Bridge]
This is for the world
This is for the glory
This is for the victory
Come on lets take it home
This is for my country
This is for my people
Kick a... yes, kick be a goal

[Chorus]
We got the game on
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the glory
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the glory

This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
