It's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight

Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay

She was a stunner
This woman was just amazing
But baby, don't play me and tell me
That you don't like to get crazy

Your mind says no
But you're body says yes
'N I'm gonna get you by the widda once
And leave you fully blessed

I am the man who can for real
Make you feel like a woman soon and maybe I will
Let's ride and I will show you the night
What it is to feel right and I was like

Let me guess, you're not the freaky type
And you don't get down on the first night
But I promise I'll make you feel so right
Come on baby, there's a first time for everything

Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay

Now she's hot and heavy, now she said she ready
And I said baby, let's start nice slow and steady
Then I'm gon' give it to you however you ask for it
I'll catch it, you throw it and baby, you know it

I'm certified around the globe
I mark my territory wherever I go
Baby, don't think twice, let's ride it now
I promise a good time and I was like

Let me guess you're not the freaky type
And you don't get down on the first night
But I promise I'll make you feel so right
Come on baby, there's a first time for everything

Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay

She said no but I know it's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight
She said no but I know it's on tonight

Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay
