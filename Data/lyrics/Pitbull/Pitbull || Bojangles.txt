If you don't know her name it's cool
call her this:
Jiggy jiggy, call that girl Bojangles.
Jiggy jiggy, call that girl Bojangles.
Jiggy jiggy, call that girl Bojangles.

[Verse 1]
I see the way you move
And I picture you nude
Baby keep movin' that thing
Baby keep movin' that thing
I wanna take you to the boom boom room
So we can do it like boom, boom, boom, boom
Pleasure, yes, God bless,
I love my women rated triple-X
Let me show you how we do it 'round here,
Man the women they don't fake it
They get naked down here
It's da bottom, no bras no drawers
Da bottom, where they holla: "TAKE IT OFF!"
Da bottom, where we turn out daughters
Just to plan a lick on the father, we got'em

Licky licky, licky licky, I like to
Licky licky, licky licky, we like to
Licky licky, licky licky, they like to
Licky licky, licky licky, DJ!!

Bring it bring it back,

I'm back for some more,
Jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
Take it back to the floor,
Jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
Bend over touch your toes,
Jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
That's right she's a pro
That's right I'm a pro
Take it to, take it to the house
Party, I'm a take it, I'm a take it to her mouth,
Boy I'm a take'em, I'm a take'em to the South,
Where them school's got classics like
Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt.
Pit is always reppin' for them boyz up the road,
For them boyz on the block yellin' "we base blow?"
Watch where ya at 'cause they will tag ya toe
Liberty City'll leave yo ass John Doe

If you see a girl that can shake, tell her just like this:
Baby take it down, baby baby take it down
