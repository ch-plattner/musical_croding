[Lloyd:]
Girl you should know that,

Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of you (of you)

[Pitbull:]
You got dat sexy walk
You got dem pretty eyes
You like Aaliyah, one in a million,
Dats how I feel inside
So I'm writin you dis one page letter,
To let you know what it is
I think about you while I'm in
Da car, da club, da crib
I don't know what you do to me
First time I feel this way
I don't know what to do no more
Attracted to you in a freaky way
I can tell that you know what to do,
When you do what you do
So how bout we get together some time,
Baby just me and you, I want to

[Lloyd:]
Girl you should know that (know that)

Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of you

[Both:]
Love it when you lick your lips,
Love your smile
Love it when you let your hair down,
That drives me wild
Baby your just right,
Baby you're my type
How bout we leave the club,
And make this our night
Let's fulfill fantasies, and live out dreams
I promise baby, I aim to please
So if you're thinking, what I'm thinking
Let's stop thinking and go
I'm your secret admirer, keep it on the low

[Lloyd:]
Girl you should know that (girl you should know)

Ooooh
At night I think of you
I want to be your lover baby
So if you need some love, give me a call boo
I can be the one, to come and freak you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lover baby
And I won't hesitate to come and fall through
Shawty I can't wait to give my heart to (you, you)
Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of (you, you)
Can't get enough of you
