That has been stripped of their innocences
She was daddy's little girl
But no matter what they kept their head up
And this is my way to say thank you
All alone in the world

Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl

To find for herself 'cause she thought
That she was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

I was raised by woman, a woman made me a man
It just too bad that a man took her innocences
And God knows that I, I will feel the shame
Commit the shame, end up killing him

Blame it on the ignorance, that's were her childhood went
New country, new languages, that's how seven years was spent
Times, you can't buy it and someone, they don't hear
I know that we bumped heads, just know mum, that I'm here

Cuba Peter Pan, the revelation was great, yeah
I wanna thank you, mum, for the way were, yeah
All your life you want to only one thing
And that was to be daddy's little girl

Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl

To find for herself 'cause she thought
That she was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

Took care of me, just like a mother
Till you got pregnant then you was off to Georgia
It was tough how we, how we were brought up
Tougher for you 'cause you had no father

Now I understand, now that I'm a man
How much a woman needs someone to call dad
You cut trough the pain, you walked trough the rain
The game ain't played you, baby, you played the game

Now you're in search of that father figure
And if you find him he denies you, Jenny fuck that
Come as a bitch even though I know she wished
She was daddy's little girl

Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl

To find for herself 'cause she thought
That she was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

This for all the woman who stayed strong and beat all the odds
She was daddy's little girl
The ones that have been raped or the once that grew up father less
All alone in the world

But still found a way to raise their kids to do the right thing
She was daddy's little girl
This for y'all, I love y'all
All alone in the world
