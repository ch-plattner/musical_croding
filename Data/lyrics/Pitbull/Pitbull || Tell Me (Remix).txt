Mamita why we gotta keep going through this 
Talk to her Frankie

[Verse 1]
Just Yesterday you said you loved me 
That there was nobody else above me
that i was yours and you were mine 
that there was no limits to our skies 
But then you had to put our love on hold 
when it came to making love it wasn't you anymore 
and now your telling me to leave 
I gotta walk out the door 
cant you see that this is killing me 
Its hurting my soul
oh baby 

[Chorus - Frankie J & Ken Y]
How am i supposed to leave you 
When my heart tells me to keep you 
how can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just cant let you go
No I just cant let you go
(Nooo)
Cant you see Im slowly dying 
But Im gonna keep on trying 
Please dont ask of me to let you goooo 

[Verse 2 - Pitbull]
Let me start 
By telling you I love you with all my heart 
But i cant understand the reason 
When you tell me your leaving 
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever 
Now instead of being in love 
Its like we are use to each other 
How could we do this to each other 
We use to ride for each other 
Die for each other 
Cry for each other 
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other 
I cant let this happen 
I refuse to lose you 
I love you baby 
Its the truth as usual 
I wanna make you happy 
Girl it aint hard to see 
you mean the world to me 
we had been though it all 
thick or thin right or wrong 
I cant let you go 'cause this love is too strong 

[Chorus - Frankie J & Ken Y]
How am i supposed to leave you 
When my heart tells me to keep you 
how can you ask me to let you go 
No I just cant let you go 
No I just cant let yo go
(Nooo) 
Cant you see Im slowly dying 
But Im gonna keep on trying 
Please don't ask of me to let you go 

[Verse 3 - Pitbull]
Look baby just tell me what you want 
Look baby just tell me what you need 
Look baby i know im far from perfect 
But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless 
I know its hard to deal with my life 
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip 
I done seen em wit this one 
I done seen em wit that one 
But everything they say is monotonous 
Cant you hear it in my voice 
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love 
And I swear to you baby 
I just want to give you my heart my soul my love 
I know we can work this out 
I know we can 
Baby lets try 
But one thing I wont do is let this love die 
(Is let this love die)

[Chorus - Frankie J & Ken Y]
How am i supposed to leave you 
When my heart tells me to keep you 
how can you ask me to let you goooo 
No I just cant let you go 
No I just cant let you go
(Nooo) 
Cant you see Im slowly dying 
But Im gonna keep on trying 
Please don't ask of me to let you goooo 

[Hook - Ken Y]
Believe me, yes Im trying to let you go 
But the only thing I get from it is all this crying 
Tell me how am I suppose to let you goooo 
no no noooo

[Chorus - Frankie J & Ken Y]
How am i supposed to leave you 
When my heart tells me to keep you 
how can you ask me to let you go 
No I just cant let you go 
No I just cant let you go
(Nooo) 
Cant you see Im slowly dying 
But Im gonna keep on trying 
Please don't ask of me to let you gooo
(no I just cant let you go)
