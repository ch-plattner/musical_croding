We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands (Mr Worldwide)
This is the night we won't forget (Chris Brown)
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la-la
La-la la la la la la-la
La la la la-la

I just hope, I hope we meet again

One thing's for certain, two things for sure
Iheart radio, I close show
My life's like Broadway
No cameras welcome to the show
One champ for them boys indictment
Broadway, negro, I'm poser than posed
My boy I told ya, baby coming back one day
Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet
Australia to UK, jump the puddle straight to the States
It's okay let 'em hate, cause they'll be coming back one day, dale

We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la

I just hope, I hope we meet again

Now the world is my backyard
And I would like to thank ya'll
Cause I was at a point, point blank
That I would point blank ya'll
I found myself, in term, I lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like an old school Manny better lost in time
They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know
But this must I can't say, to my best friend Eddie, my father, Guarilla, Abuelo Rudy, and to my brother drama I'll be back for you one day

We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

(La la la la la) To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
(La la la la la) To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
(La la la la la) To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
(La la la la la) To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again

I hope we meet again
