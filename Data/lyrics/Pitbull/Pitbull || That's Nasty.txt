[Pitbull] 
Pitbulls chillin the bottom wit no deals 
If them boys talk alot then its no reals 
Shimmya yall shimmy yay shimmy yayo 
Catch me wit picolo riding on them thangs 
Word of mouf theres a drought on the streets 
So who ever sitting on them k's is looking at some cheezle 
But dont let them boys find out where the safehouse is at 
And if its where you lay your head, what kinda safehouse is that! 
You dont deserve to hold weight you deserve to get robbed 
Your the first to turn state 
Those who got snitched on relate to 
No matter what you do heffer damn gon' hate ya 
Thats just mother nature 
Aint she a mother 
I know theese bitches named bullets and they loved to date ya 
Or better said they love to rape ya 
From the bottom to A-town the game is ours now! 

[Chorus]

They spin when you stop that's nasty

[Pitbull] 
I from the land where you name it everythings crooked 
Watch what you do cuz, everythings looking 
Man theese streets got ears and eyes 
And they wanna know its all who what when and whyz 
So when you see me on them 24's spinning 
You know the cut me a serious check 
But for now I'm still grindin fiending for a legging 
Thats some serious shit ya 
I'm involved in some serious shit ya 
I'm like TI,I'm serious bitch 
I'm giving miami a facelift 
Yall just face it 
Dont believe its wrong just taste it 

[Chorus] 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty
