You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

Locita I don't play, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart you got to work
And show me that you'll ride or die for me
I can see right through your eyes,
And I know what you trying to do
You trying to rob, steal, take my love
But fuck you, take my love? Hahaha
Not a woman on earth yeah can do that, say what?
I don't know where you're from or where you been at
I'm lettin' you know wassup
And if you don't then play by the rules
Or baby you get caught,
I talk so much, you took my love, fuck

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

Yo, I'm in the club and the place is popping
Sip sipping bud and the base is knocking
Times are great cause I'm with my crew
But my smile is fake cause I'm missing you
Baby you know that I done learn my lesson
Should I gave you more time, more love and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep telling myself a player ain't supposed to cry

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

She took my love and played for a sucker
But it don't even matter cause you know I still love her
She took my heart and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter, cause I still want her around
She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she is a professional heart breaker
But a great love maker all in the sheet, she made my heart skip a beat
But for now, shes as cold as they come
No max, no knife and no gun, she took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
