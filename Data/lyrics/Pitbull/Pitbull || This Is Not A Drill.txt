[Intro x2 - Bebe Rexha:]
This is not a drill
This is not a false alarm
This shit is for real
Baby I'm a love you down

[Chorus - Bebe Rexha:]
I-I-I don't wanna waste your time
Big girls don't cry wolf when they cry
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight
Yeah we might fall in love tonight
I-I-I don't wanna waste your time
Pretty girls always tell pretty lies
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight

This is not a drill
This is not a drill
This is not a drill, this is not a drill
This is not a false alarm

[Verse 1 - Pitbull:]
I got that sweet D, mami got that sweet pea
When I get her, all she says is "ay papi, si, si"
She give me that Road Runner, long neck, beep, beep
And her tongue do a little more than just French kiss, wei-wei
I'm talking them big numbers, Microsoft and DC's
Bring a friend and a friend, Chicago Bulls, 3-Peat
Mami got them looks that kill, yeah, she's real
Take it all off, keep them heels, this is not a drill

[Chorus - Bebe Rexha]

[Verse 2 - Pitbull:]
Mami got that top off, mami got that low ride
Mami got that big trunk, wet paint, that right
Mami got that get down, she got that lock jaw
She got that slip, she got that slide, that Pacquiao
Mami's a knockout and that's for real
Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill
Mami's a knockout and that's for real
Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill

[Chorus - Bebe Rexha]
