Oh-oh, this wild wild love of ours
It can't be tamed, no
This wild wild love of ours
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of ours
Long live this wild wild love

[Verse 1 - Pitbull:]
Ladies and gentleman
You're looking at the new playboy
Who you?
That's right, Armando Christian Perez
And when it comes to that pretty little bitty kitty
Don't stop get it get it baby let me pet it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild dirty freaky nasty, yeah I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time
Don't believe me, bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a catch twenty-two
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby you know that you love it too, that's why

You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more than money
You need it, you want it
All over your body
I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love

For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of ours
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of ours

[Verse 2 - Pitbull:]
Not only am I a client, I'm the player president
The globe is my backyard, baby it's evident
When it comes to Miami, I always represent
Read all about it, ladies and gents
I'm the chico for the game
I like my women yin
I like my women yang
I like my women fine
I like them off the chain
Take 'em all the world cup, Brazil, "Tudo bem?"
You know I'll meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right
I don't know if I can handle all five
But baby we can try tonight, darlin'

You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more than money
You need it, you want it
All over your body
I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love
