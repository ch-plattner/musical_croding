
Ask for money, and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty but that chico nice
Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

One day while my light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, come on, darling, que la cosa esta rica

(I just wanna feel this moment)

[Beat break]

Feel this moment...

Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long way from them hallways
Filled with "So"'s and "Oh, yeah"'s
Dade county always, 305 all day
Now baby we can parlay, or, baby, we can party.
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie ups
I got her hooked, cause she seen me in a suit with a red tie tied up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya. But time is money
Only difference is I own it,
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day while my light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment

[Beat break]

Come on, feel this moment...

I see the future but live for the moment.
Make sense, don't it? Ha.
Now make dollars, I mean billions, I'm a genius, I mean brilliance
This streets is what schooled 'em
And made 'em slicker than Slick Rick The Ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with all my peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And I can give you all you can see

Time is money
Only difference is I own it,
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale.

One day while my light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment

[Beat break]

Come on, feel this moment...

(Ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment
(Ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment
