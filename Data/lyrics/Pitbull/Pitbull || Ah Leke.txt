Ah le leke leke leke leke leke...

It's Pit there, for sure
Now get down, get low
Who's got Miami all night long
That's not a question, no more
The world is my block
The globe is my home
It's a proof, in fact
But that chico got his own

I don't spit it down, gotta live it
Millions of dollars, go get it
Billions of them
Now way, watch out
I don't call, now slim it
When I blast the game
And I'm more like
"Yeah, kill it"
I'll be up all night
Go ahead and be the realist

[Refrain x3:]
All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Where she'd said she go?

Pit showed up and broke up
On stage with two big booties
Yo, like me, it's cool
I'm lord of Pit, Pit's suma
They count it, what school me
Y'all fools, you can't fool me
I'd never worried 'bout beef
Because my brother is 6th Avenue
I got that point out of my blood
All I know is how to lead teams
I grew up around, no kinda games from T.N.
As IPs, HCs, BOBs, LPs, VIPs
So pale, shine oh, wide low,

[Refrain x3:]
All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Where she'd said she go?

It's that shit that defines me
MBA came find me
Even if they did I'd sell for two billion, smiling (ha ha)
Mo lokey no sirens, grew up around keys and violence
Was taught to stay silent
Now silence

[Refrain x3:]
All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Where she'd said she go?
