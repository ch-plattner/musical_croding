now let me see you go to work on that strip pole
I love it when you work that hit the floor
How you do that gimme some more
Humpback, humpback, hoochie momma
All I really want is some coochie momma
You a star when you work the pole
We don't make it rain we make it snow
When you go fast then break it down slow
From the window to the wall
Get low
This is for the strippers that be shaking for them tips
Big oh ass big oh tits, pretty ass pussy, pretty ass lips
Baby your amazing....

Tell me who your creeping with, I wanna know
Lying to my face again
I know you on the low
My boys done told me that your doin' wrong
So baby tell me...

No le hagas caso daddy
Yo solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

You think that I'm a fool babe
Don't make me lose my cool babe
Not tryin to hear what you say
You can't play me

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air, grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh.....

You don't know the half of it
I found you out last Friday
Thought I was out to get you
At the club I met Peaches
She said she knew your secret
I asked if you were hookin' or creepin'
I had a quick lap dance
Damn near skeed in my pants (Whoa)
Look how bitches got me sweatin' in my white-T
Lovin' how she do me
Then I saw you in stilettos and a thong
Shaking that booty to the "Do the Brown" song (Do the Brown)
Shorty gots to go ooh oh...

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh [2x]

Let me see you climb the pole to the top
Let go, make it drop
Make it clap, don't stop
One check at a time don't stop
I've been waiting all night to see you take it off
I got some paper baby you can take it all
What you wanna do?
We can go to the back boom, boom fo' sho
These just them things that be going down in them strip clubs
Bend over baby come over and get these crispy dubs

No le hagas caso daddy
Solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

You think that I'm a fool babe
don't make me lose my cool babe
Not trying to hear what you say
You can't play me

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh....[2x]

How you gonna play this thug?
