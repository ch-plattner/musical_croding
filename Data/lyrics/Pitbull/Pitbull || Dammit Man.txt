[Intro]
Dammit man (Lil Jon), D-D-Dammit man
(Pitbull) D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man
Dammit man (Lil Jon), D-D-Dammit man
(Pitbull) D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man

[Chorus]
When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man!
(Dammit man!) [4x]

(What? Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us
(Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us
(Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us
(Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us
Y'all really can't fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'ma kill 'em in the club with this one
I'ma tear the club the fuck up
I'ma have 'em goin' to war over this one
Partna, just listen
If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back
Because I'm playing fo' keeps, go ahead keep playing with me
And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again
For those who didn't believe in the kid
Yall might as well be dead
because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all
I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap,
and I'm outrunning y'all
When I hit 'em from the back
I got them mami's saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth
I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (one more time!, whoo)
When I hit 'em from the back
I got them mami's saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth
I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh
Put that up dammit
But me and you both know that these niggaz ain't ready
They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Whoo!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain,
dammit man
But I don't plan it man,
because I do what I wanna do, move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
I'ma tell you like biggie told me,
cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
cause when those things get pulled
out and squeezed, they'll spray about three
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up,
give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up,
but I'm a pro (one more time!, whoo)
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up,
but I'm a pro...
So all ya'll amateur ass niggaz do-don't try to sit home
Pit's co-co-coming, running gunning fo-fo that throne

[Chorus]

(What? Fuck With Us, What)
Yall really can't fuck with us
(Fuck With Us, What)
Yall really can't fuck with us
(Fuck With Us, What)
Yall really can't fuck with us
(Fuck With Us, What)
Yall really can't fuck with us
Yall really can't fuck with us
