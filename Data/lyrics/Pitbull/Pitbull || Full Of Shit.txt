[Pitbull:]
I know you full of shit

[Chorus:]
Your so full of shit [x8]

[Verse 1:]
Believe nothing of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe nothing of what you hear
And only half what you see
Believe nothing of what you hear
And only half of what you see
(let me tell you what I think about there boys out here in the state they call the game)
Beleive nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see

Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

[Verse 2:]
I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pa pa playing a part
All they talk about is they money
And ch ch chosin cars
So put pha pha phatoms and belinzin?
And how they squeeze to listen getting high
They move it hooray
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talking back
Wha wha what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str straight to they momma's house
Like southern cali they hardly ever make it rain to drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles

Ahh tell um

[Chorus:]
Your so full of shit [x8]

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Believe nothing of what your hear
And only half of what you see [x4]

[Verse 3:]
The boy knows his alaphabet so he think he a g
He run a little pot so he think he a dope boy
Bu bu but all eyes on me
Then he gets to wanna be like mike
Now they wannabe just for the mic
They cut fucked up the diz ol music
And even if they got 25 to life

They'll be singing like whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi
They'll be singing like whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi

Now tell um

Believe nothing of what you hear

A bank account full of money
They act like they on full
But check this out fool

[Chorus:]
Your so full of shit [x8]

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Believe nothing of what you hear
And only half of what you see [x4]
