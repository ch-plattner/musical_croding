Love me tonight girl we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay baby, (ha ha ha ha)

Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay baby cause everybody fucks

[Pitbull:]
I know it's straight to the point
But I'd rather be straight up and straight forward
Instead of playing with your heart and your mind
Games are waste of time, now we can do the nasty
And do what the do and see what the does
Either we gon love what we do to each other
Or just let it be what it was
No harm, no foul, no commitment, no vows
Maybe a contract or two
But by that time I'm already tired of the way you like it, oh
And let your body decide, exactly what it does
But it's no secret baby, everybody fucks

I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

[Akon:]
Love me tonight girl we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does, it's okay baby

Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay baby cause everybody fucks

[David Rush:]
Now I can hear your body calling me
Tell me what it is, what's gon be
Only got one night cause I'm...
Lil mama is a bad one, ain't she?
Maybe she might be a little timid
Love when I get it
Or I might even give a text when I'm finish
Been doing all this talking, let's get it
And you can tell me what you wanna do
I guarantee you can do that
Or you can teach me like a thing or two
But I bet you I already knew that
So one night one time baby girl
Let's take this chance
We ain't trying to be love strung
But I know that

(Everybody fucks)

[Pitbull:]
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

[Chorus:]
Love me tonight girl we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does, it's okay baby

Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay baby cause everybody fucks

[Akon:]
Let your body go, let your feeling show
Say what's on your mind, I already know
I can read your eyes, see your body sign
(Every sign you give baby) with a little bump and grind
Nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
Baby there ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
There ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
Baby there ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind

[Chorus:]
Love me tonight girl we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does, it's okay baby

Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Cause everybody fucks, la la la la...
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay baby cause everybody fucks

Believe that believe that baby
Everybody fucks
