[Pitbull]
A billion's the new million
You heard me, Sensato
It's Mr. Worldwide
Y el mundo Del Patio
Live my dreams, ya'll dormant
Category 6 as I storm in
Take this as a, take this a warning
Welcome to, welcome to global warming
I'm tired of this rap shit cause all they do is rap shit
About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit
But they never sold coke, crack or click clack shit
That's why I'm laughing to the bank, ha-ha bitch
Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit
Without Denver, I'm going to November
Earth Wind & Fire, I'm all for September
George Lopez puta, you remember
Non-stop about bankers and lenders
Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas splendor
I see your game, your plan, your agenda
They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo
No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
I do it for the paper, I'm a business man
If you get it that's cool
It's all about the billionaires baby, welcome to the new school

[Sensato]
Abeli, Abeli, al banco voy abrile
Una cuenta pa meterle al mille mille y matarile
I get's money en mi bloque hay misilies
Hay que comprarle shemileks y zapatos bien reptiles
It's all about them billionaires
I'm so fucking serious
Look at all them zeros, they looking like Cheerios
Monty like I bury it, y'all nigga gotta hurry up
My team is in your area, regando la epidemia
Tengo una novia ademia, blanquita y makademia
Estoy enfermo leukemia, y'all bronkers got anemia
So if you get it that's cool
It's all about them billionaires baby, welcome to the new school
