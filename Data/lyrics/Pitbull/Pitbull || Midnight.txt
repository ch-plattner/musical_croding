I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
That's why

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to fight it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to hide it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me, girl

Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente
Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente

I'm a introduce ya to da real me
It's the 3-0-5 til it kill me
I'm like a deck of cards
Ya gotta deal with me
Want war? Then Navy Seal with me
I don't need ice for women to chill with me
Drivin' crazy like Bobby did Whitney
Or like Kevin did Britney
Or maybe like Kanye did 50
I'm as drunk as a skunk, high as a hippie
Whole lot of vodka, lil bit of Crippie
All suckee-suckee, please no hickey
Baby mess with me, I'll have you in da

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to fight it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to hide it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me, girl

Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente
Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente

When I see ya (see ya)
Wanna taste ya (taste ya)
Wanna feel ya (feel ya)
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout (talkin' 'bout)
But them nights (nights)
Only happen (happen)
Once in ya life (life)
And I ain't rappin'
I wanna take ya til ecstasy without ecstasy
Just follow me (follow me)
And let me do the things I want to
I promise baby that you'll want me to
I wanna strap ya, shake ya, break ya
Make ya lose ya mind, lose control and lose it all
C'mon baby, I make it hot weather - spring, summer, fall
That's why

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to fight it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to hide it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me, girl

Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente
Yo me siento caliente
Tu me pones caliente

I know you see me in your dreams
I know you see me in your dreams
I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
(My mind's playin' tricks on me)
I know you see me in your dreams
That's why

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to fight it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Don't try to hide it
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
You think about me, girl

In the middle of the night
It's the 3-0-5
Casely
We got it goin' in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
