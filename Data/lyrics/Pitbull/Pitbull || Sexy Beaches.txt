
I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the summer search my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels
I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels

Little mama wanna turn it up
Little mama wanna burn it up
Little mama wanna live it up
Well, little mama better give it up

And the mama is like wow
And the booty's like bang, bang, bang
I don't bring sand to the beach
Bring the beach to the sand

And I know what they want
And I know what they need
I just look'em in the eyes
And they're leaving with me
We will do all the wrong things
Wrong things you like
Baby, better do it tonight
Let's ride

I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the summer search my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels
I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels

You can't save me, babe, it's too late
I'm looking for a freak, not a soulmate
Sexy beaches, hotels
Mirrors on the roof
Making more fun - ain't that the truth
Whose on the world are not mine
I just aim that time
And bring a girlfriend
Cause she's so damn fan

And I know what they want
And I know what they need
I just look'em in the eyes
And they're leaving with me
We will do all the wrong things
Wrong things you like
Baby, better gonna do it tonight
Let's ride

I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the summer search my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels
I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels
Sexy beaches, hotels
Sexy beaches, hotels
