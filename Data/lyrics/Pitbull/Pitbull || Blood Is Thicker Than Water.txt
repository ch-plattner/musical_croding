I Know Ya'll Listen To My Music (Redd Eyez) But What I'mma Do Know Is Try And Describe My Life To Ya'll

[Pitbull:]
Sometimes I Fell Like I'm Loosing It 
My Life Is Upside Down 
A Gift And A Curse That's My Life Now 
There Is No Looking Or Turning Back 
I Used To Watch Coke Turn To Crack That's What Made Me Turn To Rap
I Fell Like Keanu Reeves In The Movie Devils Advocate 
Confused But Blessed With Extravagance 
I Thank God For All The Opportunities 
Given The Opportunity Dem Boys Would Put Two In Me (Bla Bla Bla)
We Live In The Land Of The Free, Hustlers And Thieves 
I Made Money Now I Got Uncle Sam Hustling 
Me For A Quarter Of What I Make 
Hand A Quarter Sentence To A Fake And Watch Them Turn State (That's Right)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That's Just The Way It Is) 
Most Of These Fools Are Characters 
Men With No Character Welcome To America 
Where We Fight For Freedom 
If Ain't About Oil Than We Don't Need Them 
Ain't That The Truth? 
Pitbull I'm Just Tell Ya'll The Way I Fell 
Thank God That God Made Me To Keep It Real

[Chorus:]
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Fame Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till Dem Bitches Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Money Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)

[Redd Eyez:]
Huh Hun Yo 
After The Turf War The Smoke Clears 
All These Years Around These Busta I'm Convinced There Ain't No Hope Here
In The Past Four Years Of My Lifetime I Witness Leaders Sacrifice Freedom Just To Get This Pipeline
Guess I'm Chosen At The Right Time Mama Stress
Facing The Table And She's Snorting Up White Line 
Blood Is Thicker Than Water
In A Few Cases Your Daughter Can Have Touched For The Money That In Dem Suit Case 
Tighten My Shoelaces The Fugitive Running 
In Fear Of A Criminal Past Cuz Dem Folks Is Coming 
I've Been Wrongfully Judged Being From This Environment 
The City Gangs Planning Retirement 
I'mma A Dade Nigga 
Voicing My Set Cuz A Spray Quick 
Took Some Of The Same Steps Through Little Haiti As These Main Nigga (Like Who) Hit Man, Big Dogg, And Shehound 
Ya'll Predict It Back Then Shit I See It Know

[Chorus:]
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That Just The Way It Is )
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Fame Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till Dem Bitches Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Money Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)

[Pitbull:]
I Escape Poverty (Poverty) 
I Don't Own Jewelry Motherfucker I Own Property 
You Can Send Dem Tsunamis That Hit Indonesia (But But But) 
Ain't No Motherfucking Thing Stopping Me 
Like Good Coke I'm A Good Swimmer God Knows I Done Lost But God Dam I'm A Good Winner
It Feels Great To Make Something Out Of Nothing Yea I'm Humble But I Tell Ya'll To Push A Chico's Buttons 
And Watch How Them Thing Get To Dumping 
Real-Estate New York Game Now You Saying Something 
I Only Talk About What I Know About 
Illegal Turn Legal This Year That's What I'm All About
I'm From The South And I Ain't Gonna Lie 
At Fist Time I Preach Ye Till God Struck Me With Pride 
I Was Confused Now I'm Like Let's Ride 
305 Till I Die 
305 Till I Die 

Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Fame Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till Dem Bitches Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Money Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
