Caperucita Roja, a donde tu va?
Pa lavante la tchu tchu tchu tcha
Wow, como ha cambiado este cuento
Pero me gusta, dale

I'm picking you, you what I want (Enrique Iglesias)

I need your tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha (reporting live from Rio de Janeiro)
Tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha

Meet and greets, nice to meet ya, I love to teach you, I love to freak you
She loves religions it's cool, baby, find a preacher
She wants control but at least
She wants a contract hmm how briefs
To be honest, I just wanna fuck to say the least

I know you wanna give me a piece of that ass
I can see it in your eyes yeah yeah yeah
And you can try, you can try to fight
But you gonna say yeah yeah yeah

I'm picking you, you what I want
I want your tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha,
Tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha

Tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha

You know my reputation
We ain't gotta talk about it baby I feel about it
I ain't got no patience so let's ra-a-a-ap, we're here for long time,
We're here for a good time,
So take a sip of that Voli and unwind,
And let me fuck you blind, dale...

I know you wanna give me a piece of that ass
I can see it in your eyes yeah yeah yeah
And you can try, you can try to fight
But you gonna say yeah yeah yeah

I'm picking you, you what I want
I want your tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha,
Tchu tcha tcha tchu tchu tcha
I'm picking you, you what I need

If you, you know
How much I want you right now
Girl I'm on the line, see you come around
