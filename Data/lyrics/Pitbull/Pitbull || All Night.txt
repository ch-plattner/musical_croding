Russia, it’s a world wide
You can catch me in Russia
At a millionaire’s night
Nah I ain’t no russian
But I get what I like
Baby know russian
I’ma tell you what I want

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don’t care
Any universe, any atmosphere
Clock say 1:12 so we’re outta here
We can do it everywhere
She throwing up dubs screaming west side
I got a cali king you can fit just right
Pick cars depending on what’s the best drive
Give you the keys, let you test drive
Top floor, with the sweet sounds great
Looking out the window over the tristate
She come mad early and leave mad late
And I ain’t eating at the table, don’t need no plates
Her clothes in the bedroom floor,
We’re not even in the bedroom no more
I get a text message in the morn
Like daddy, go ahead and to me like that tonight

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
Go upstairs, back down soon
My couch’s soft, my floor too
We can take a day if you want too
Turn john like tv, hd, 3d
I spin you around like a cd
Baby don’t make it so easy
She won’t let...
She recking my place like tasmanian devil
I’m giving the base, she giving the trebble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun’s up
Or we can get it in when the sun’s down
Or maybe we can meet halfway
Either way, baby girl I’ma put it down

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night.
