Chris Brown, you set it off

[Chris Brown:]
Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up
The night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go
And no one else can find

Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun

Wanna have fun for a night?

Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time

The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun

Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong
Ah Mami that turns me on, now just listen to the song and 

[Chris Brown:]
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun

Come on Mami, you know what it is
Come on baby, you know what it is
I wanna uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want you can bring your friends
Come on Mami, you know what it is
Come on baby, you know what it is
I wanna uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want you can bring your friends
And we can F.U.N. fun

Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
