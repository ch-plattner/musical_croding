Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oogie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby get your booty naked, take off all your clothes,
And light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
I'm a fireball

Fireball

I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, I saw, I conquered, I came
They say the chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin' he runnin' the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way

[John Ryan:]
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best (that's right) you've ever had (that's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Fireball
Fireball

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don't care what y'all say
'Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gonna learn
That this chico right here don't play
That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A. U.S.A.
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way

[John Ryan:]
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best (that's right) you've ever had (that's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Fireball

Now we're bringing it

Tell her baby baby baby baby

I tell her baby baby baby
I'm a fireball
