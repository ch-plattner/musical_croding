[Chorus - Jason Derulo:]
Do you wanna ride baby
Cause I don't mind driving you crazy
I heard you like to go fast girl
Cause no, I don't run out of gas girl
So would you let me pull up to your bumper
In my new black car
Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
Pull up to your bumper
In my new black car
Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition

And let's ride... baby
While I drive... you crazy

Let's ride... baby
While I drive... you crazy

[Verse 1 - Pitbull:]
Catch me on New Year's Eve, on Fox
Bringing that Miami Heat, white hot
She's like "papi, why you work so hard", why not?
That's not what she says when I'm working that box
Now ride baby, forget about the past and ride baby
Once you give it up, you'll be mine baby
Not on the first night, don't lie baby

[Pre-Chorus - Pitbull:]
Cause girl I like it fast, you like it slow
Where I'm gonna take you, you never been before
Hit the gas until we lose control
You in for a wild ride

[Chorus - Jason Derulo]

[Verse 2 - Juicy J:]
Ride it like a first class seat on a plane
Baby, go insane, make me remember your name
As we go up and down, roller coaster ride
Spread it open, let me go inside
Let me slide in between and park my stretch limousine
When I slap that ass, you soaking wet
Tonights one night, that you won't forget
We tryna get a bone, let's play fetch, baby
I'm on deck like an old cassette
When I'm through, you gon' want you a souvenir
Stuff so good, make you shed a tear
With a smile on your face from ear-to-ear
And a tattoo that say "Juicy J was here."

[Pre-Chorus - Jason Derulo]
