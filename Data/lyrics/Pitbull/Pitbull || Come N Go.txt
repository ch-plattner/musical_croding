
I've been around the world, and there
Seen a little bit of everything
Heard a lot, learned a lot, on how to hit the spot, ding, ding, ding
And if the price is right, I mean the night is right, I mean the time is right
So do her thing, and I know the price, night, and time is right
So dimelo mami, don't play no games
Dale mama, talk to me straight
Please, please no chase
Now this isn't the debate, and I ain't even chase

Mami you're the internet, and I'm looking for a download
And if you don't know, now you know
Yeah, I make them come and go

I make the girls come!
I make the girls go!

I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!
I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!

Now you heard about me, and I ain't gotta say much
I ain't talking about cars, it's automatic and pop your clutch
You gon' do things baby, you never done before
And you will say things baby, you never said before
You will think us baby, you never thought you did
This is eyes wide shut, Times 10, so baby don't blink.

Mami you're the internet, and I'm looking for a download
And if you don't know, now you know
Yeah, I make them come and go

I make the girls come!
I make the girls go!

Su tia ta buena, su madre ta buena
Toda tan buena (I make the girls go!)

I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!
I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!

That's right...that's right....[repeats]
Say with me now...

Lalalalalalalalalalala....

I make the girls go!

I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!
I make them come, make them come
Make them go-o-o
I make them come, make them come
I make the girls go!
