Hey Jim Jones,

We Tell Em Puff, Puff Pass Wit Yo Punk Ass

U Know Tha Drill

U Know Tha Drill
Roll It Up
U Know Tha Drill 
Light It Up 
U Know Tha Drill
Smoke It Up 
Now Puff, Puff Pass Wit Yo Punk Ass
U Messin Up The Rotation 
That Thang There Burnin Fast
This Ain't A Joke, Stop Playin 
I Need To Smoke
This Thang Can Get Dirty 
And I Ain't Talkin Bout Sprinklin Coke
I Need That Sticky Icky
That Miami Crippy
That Washington High Purple
Watch Out That Thang Will Hurt U 
I Need That Cali Chronic
Damn A Chico On It 
Some Of That Seatlle Supersonic
Will Have U Like I Don't Want It 
Messed Up
High As A Kite
Now Roll The Next One
And Pass Me The Light 
Cuz We Ready (Fa Sho)
Ready (To Go)
Ready (To Blow)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
If Thirty's the new Twenty
Patron's The New Henney
Roll In A New Bentley
Blowin Like Two Twenty
That Ain't The Price Of The Car
Now That's A Half Ounce Of Piff Dawg (Purple)
U Gotta Have A Strong Chest Just To Hit The Raw
Or You'll Be Coughin Up A Lung
Harlem Where We From 
So Of Course We Gettin Drunk (Twisted)
We Hit The Parties, Poppin Bottles Just For Fun (Ballin)
Smoke In Ya Club, Call The Coppers
Let Em Come 
Miami, Trey 0 Five 
We Cop It Out The Bro House (Fo Shizzy)
A Generator, So The Lights Don't Go Out (Two Of Dem)
A Big Profit In That Greenery
We Now Stoppin By The Beach Just For Scenery
When Here It's 45, Up Here It's 65
Meet U In Carolina
Get It For 55 (We Got Them Pounds)
Cuz Everyday We Hustlin 
It's Heavy Cake And Druggin It 
So Heavyweight We Smuggle It

[Hook]
