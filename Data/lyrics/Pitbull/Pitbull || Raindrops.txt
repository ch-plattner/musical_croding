Anjuli Star,
Pitbull
this dedicated to everybody who lost somebody important in their life, dont worry their in a better place now.

[Anjuli Stars]
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cus I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you (yeah)
Every hour solemn I need you
Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do
There's so much to give 
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky its burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here

[Chorus]
Raindrops 
I hope one day that this pain stops (no no)
Raindrops
I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away
Washing me away 
Washing me away
Washing me away

[Pitbull]
I miss you dad 

Still dealing with my the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog 
But you know that I'm a ride to the end (I love you)
I didn't cry when you died
But im a let my tears fall on the track
My brother yula just came home
And it feels good to have him back
(Welcome home dog)
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you had till its gone
That's why im a take advantage of the fact im breathin
And the words of this song are
Dedicated to eddie and maria
But I know in the future Im a see ya
I know your both looking down on me , proud
I know ya both love me

[chorus]
Raindrops 
I hope one day that this pain stops (no no)
Raindrops
I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away
Washing me away 
Washing me away
Washing me away

See in life things go wrong 
If it don't kill you its only goin make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then theres something wrong
Ironic aint it thats just the way life is
That's why I thank god every chance that I get for blessing me 
With beautiful kids

What's victory with no laws
What's smiling with no tears
Whats love with no hate
Whats courage with no fears
Just think about it and apply to your life
And no matter what the problem is 
Don't worry baby keep your head up
Its goin be alright

[chorus]
