[Intro:]
Shakespeare 
Mr. 305
This is to them boys that be in the club that talk a whole lot of nothing

[Chorus:]
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Let's ride (let's ride)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride

[Verse 1:]
I'm rolling
Through the backstreets
Them boys don't applaude
But they clap heat
I'm in that seven forty-fizzle 
with them dark boys on it low key
Blowing that oooh-eee...
Jump out They like who's he?
Imma snatch about two or three
It's a Dade thing when you speak cocaine 
Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang
I'm stating facts
This where we from
The bottom dawg
This where you come 
When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought
Looking for a good price 
Hit 95 south
K's as in kilos
P's as in pounds
E as in ex,
We got it on deck
So show some respect
To the cocaine capital
Dade-County bitch!

[Chorus:]
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Let's ride (let's ride)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride

[Verse 2:]
Shhh...
Be quiet
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
I'm cool, I'm quiet
A couple shots will put yo ass on a diet
This is for them big boys
Doing them big things
In the big chevy's 
With them big rims
Making big noise
With them big speakers
And anytime they cook yaye 
Its some big beakers
Listen buddy 
We off the chain
Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't 
Listen buddy
We off the chain
I suggest you hand over them thangs
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torrez
Ese si era mi consorte
And I missed ya dad
But I know you watching me
With you in heaven
I know ain't stopping me
The game is mine now
I'm building --
I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld
Sign, seal, deliver: Its done
Ready or not, here I come 
Dale!

[Chorus:]
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Shhh...
Be quiet 
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Let's ride (let's ride)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride
Shhh...
