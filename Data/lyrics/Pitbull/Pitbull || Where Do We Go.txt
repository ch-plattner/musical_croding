[Intro:]
Let's... (Mr. Worldwide)... Take over
MK, the
Jim Johnson, globe
Let's take over the globe
Hey-heyyy-yeah [x4]
Let the world know

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Pitbull)]
Where do we go from here
World tell me please
Where do we go from here
I want the world to tell me please
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go... from here)

[Pitbull:]
And you wanna tell me the sky's the limit, when there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars not me, I'm good
Half of the world don't like me, half of the world wanna be me
But believe it or not that pretty little thing they call Earth, needs me
I'm here to show the world what it means to make something from nothing yeah fo'sho
I'm here to show the world what it is to good business, how I blew it I blow
I'm here to show the world that money don't buy happiness believe me I know
But just one thing I wanna show the world - I just wanna know

[Chorus]

[Pitbull:]
As the sun rotates and Pit gets bigger
And more countries in the world like Hitler
Commando bomb, double 0, 3, 0, 5
AKA Mr. Worldwide, ha ha ha
Don't be silly - I've had it on lock and that's fo'sho
I already changed my city, now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm trying to inspire the world
To show what you did when you hustle and you work hard
Show 'em what it is, to put your life on the line for the love of the crime
Life is a rhyme with no reason, and that's the reason I rhyme
But once I show the globe
I just wanna know

[Jamie Foxx:]
Where do we go from here
World tell me please
Where do we go from here
I want the world to tell me please

[Chorus]

[Outro x4: Pitbull]
You must be blind
If you can't see the world is mine
