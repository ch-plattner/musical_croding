Let's celebrate

I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we're making history
I just wanna celebrate

We've been around the world, say ain't so
Work hard, play hard, all day long
All the continents get jealous over me
You can see me 3D overseas
If you know me then you know where to find me
Off to the Bahamas with the play room behind me
Now live it up, live it up, live it up
Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
And we gon'
Boom boom around the world
Boom boom no kidding girl
Boom boom
That's the way we like to play
We gon'
Boom boom around the world
Boom boom no kidding girl
Boom boom
That's the way we like to play

I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we're making history
I just wanna celebrate

Turn it up
Turn it up

Well I've been patiently waiting for you to shake and shake it
Make it or take it
The point is we made it
Quarter by the game, call us Tom Brady
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies
But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator
All around the globe, matter fact see your later
They're great, we're great at world war, dominators
And we're also some smooth operators, and we gon'

Boom boom around the world
Boom boom no kidding girl
Boom boom
That's the way we like to play
We gon'
Boom boom around the world
Boom boom no kidding girl
Boom boom
That's the way we like to play

I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we're making history
I just wanna celebrate

Turn it up
Turn it up

Live it up (Live it up), don't let life live you (Live you)
It's a good time (Good time), so we give you (Give you)
Now live it up, live it up, live it up
What you wanna do?

I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we're making history
I just wanna celebrate

Turn it up
Let's celebrate
Turn it up
