[Pitbull - Intro] 
Drop, They thought he was done dawg, 
but he's back bigger, better, stronger and free (ha ha ha), 
like I ain't fucked my way out of all these motherfuckin' situations, 
Watch this, 

[Verse] 
Im here to remind you, just in case you forgot, 
MR 305 no label stay hot, 
38 choppers, but please no glock, 
used to move work but had no trap no block no spot, 
ma was cool with work, but no rocks, 
until she found my first nickel ruff bag, 
said I had enough shit to push a dad, 
so she told me to get the fuck out the pad, 
i was out to my first baby mama's crib, 
caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib, 
thank god for music my saviour, 
thats what helped me fight Xavier, 
don't believe these rappers and what they play ya, 
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa, 
shit better say it, 
I am an owner, bitch! 

[Avery Storm - Bridge] 
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender, 
let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
City on my back and I won't surrender, 
let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
they don't know (what I got into), 
they don't know (everything I been through), 
they don't know (what it takes to get through), 
they don't know, they don't know, 

[Pitbull - Chorus] 
My life, pain, 
struggle, hustle, grind, 
them boys knock me down, 
you must be out yo fuckin' mind, 
My mom taught me to fight, 
Dade county raised me right, 
and we gon' take over this thing, 
put down my fuckin' life, 

[Verse] 
Lemme come back, I've been here for years, 
grindin', blood, sweat and tears. 
I don' gave the game my life, 
turned the streets from my bitch to my wife, 
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit, 
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit, 
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit, 
Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit, 
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls, 
y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all, 
young and stay, we realest, 
i'm on my way to the show, 
gettin' paid, marvellous rates, 
you the ace im the spade, 
cut cut gay, buck buck spray, 
this ain't a duck duck goose, 
this duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that.

City on my back and I won't surrender, 
let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
they don't know (what I got into), 
they don't know (everything I been through), 
they don't know (what it takes to get through), 
they don't know, they don't know, 

[Pitbull - Chorus]

[Avery Storm - Verse] 
Now you can stack the world against me, 
close the doors, I can't come in, 
you could bet your life against me, 
bet your ass I'm gonna win, 
you take that chance, you roll them dice, 
i prove you wrong, you prove me right, 
so damn what they say anywayyyy
