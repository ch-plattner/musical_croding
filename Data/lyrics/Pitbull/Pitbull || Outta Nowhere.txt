
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Everytime one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere?

I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I seen my past life and politely passed
But I’m already planning on doing it big
For my life after death, and live my life after death (baby baby)
Baby, what you think all the training is for?
Just to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
If you look out for them friends that are really foes
This career tried to swallow us
Paparazzi tried to follow us
I’m everything that my mama was:
Rider, survivor, a motherfucking fighter.
Thank god for this rapping shit (thank you)
Forget the cash – it's about happiness
Normal life – that’s for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words

Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Everytime one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere?

The critics going nowhere (nowhere)
Think that they know me like the Bible, oh hell (hell)
But they don’t understand me, oh well
Snitching is a sport now so please do tell (do tell)
The world how I raise hell
Yeah, I did the crime but I skip jail
I’m just trying to own teams, get it player
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours baby
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late
And we can both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a date
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war cock back and reload
A normal life, that’s for the birds
I work hard, so you never say these words

Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Everytime one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
