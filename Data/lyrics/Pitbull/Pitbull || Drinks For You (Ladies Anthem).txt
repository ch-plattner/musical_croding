
Its mr worlwide
With the j to the l (o o o)
Jenny let me talk to em

If you think its a joke, go head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school just not with my class
I'm like einstein, I created my math
Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made em numbers right
Will you evaluate, jennifer baby let's celebrate

I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
This drink is for you
This drink is for you

This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked 2 to 3 jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate

I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
This drink is for you
This drink is for you

I see you baby getting your hair done getting your nails tight
I see you baby trying on different outfits
Making sure they fit right
I see you baby getting ready for the night
Making sure you look right
I see you baby I see you baby

You cant stop the beat
La ra la la li
Get up on your feet, let's go
You cant stop the beat
La ra la la li
Get up on your feet, let's go
Go go go go go go go go
Talk to me

I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate

This drink is for you
This drink is for you
