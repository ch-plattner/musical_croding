Baby you aint gotta front if you want me
Baby you aint gotta front if you want me

[Chorus]
Baby you aint gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is believe me
Shorty cuz I want you

Baby you aint gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is believe me
Shorty cuz I want you

Ima tell you my thoughts mami then you can tell me what you think
We can discuss everything you wanna do baby over these drinks
U can tell me how you want it 4-5 it you can tell me how you like it

I aint here to sell you dreams or paint you some pretty pictures
I just wanna get in those jeans and just like a robbery lick u
Baby you got me feelin crazy don’t worry bout these haters
Wait up wait up I got room keys come see me later
We can fulfill fantasies so call ur girls

I can tell by the way you shake it all now

[chorus]

Now im feelin a little whoozy its like the rooms spinnin and movin
I feel her body next to mine im so fucked up its like im blind
All I fell is her throwin her back and im lovin that
Im so caught up in the moment aint no holdin back never that
Mammi aint on “e” but I got her eyes rollin back
Mammi you sole on me let me show you how to play with that
Now please let me show you a freaks technique
I know that ur a freak just discreet
Suga check this out this gonna be a night to remember 
I can tell by the way you shake it all

[Chorus]
