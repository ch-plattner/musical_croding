All I gotta do is take you home. I gotta feeling this party has just begun. It's all I want.
I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one. It's all I want.
I gotta feeling that you're gonna give me some. It's all I want. 
Baby. It's all I want. 

You know the type of women that I like, the ones that understand my life, the ones that understand wrong is right.
So let's do something wrong tonight. You name it, I'll do it. Always the fluid, in Spanish I'm fluent.
That means my tongue is bilingual, ready to play with that spot where you tingle.
Gotta bingo, she's a star, ringo. Her and two friends? Hmm, I like that lingo.
She asked if I'm single, I said "of course not" and she loved it.
Next thing you know we're both having fun in public! Dale!

You know I love an open mind. So I can see what you're thinking.
That way I can give you exactly what you want, matter of fact, what you drinking? 
Some call it pimpin, I call it leverage. 
I call it slips, they call it marriage. She got me up like the Eiffel Tower no Paris. 
Mami, you can fuck like a rabbit but no diamonds, no carats.
She asked if I'm single, I said "of course not" and she loved it.
