
My girl's the kind of girl that walks in her own world,
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool.
My girl's what these other girls wanna be,
But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl!

[Chorus:]
She good like my kinda girl,
She walk like my kinda girl,
She talk like my kinda girl,
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Get in line, get in line
Cause every nigga in here want you!

You name it, she's got it, cheatin' realistic about it,
Disrespecting, act-a-fool in public, I doubt it!
If there's skeletons in the closet, that's where she keeps em,
I do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em.
Even if she's playing with time sequence, she keeps 'em,
Never goes through his mind, she respects the crown,
I respect her mind, that's why I made her, man!
For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus:]
She good like my kinda girl,
She walk like my kinda girl,
She talk like my kinda girl,
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Get in line, get in line
Cause every nigga in here want you!

My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision!
That's food for thought; now let 'em haters do the dishes!
A pair of tall heels and her stockings fishnets,
And ain't talking fishing, she's got a six sense.
[?] don't impress her,
She'll break a full court so watch how you press her!
She came from nothing so she knows some, yeah, that's true!
For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus:]
She good like my kinda girl,
She walk like my kinda girl,
She talk like my kinda girl,
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Get in line, get in line
Cause every nigga in here want you!

My girl's the kind of girl that walks in her room,
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool.
My girl is what these other girls wanna be,
But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl!

Sometimes she bougie, sometimes she hood
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch! That's understood!
And when she's with me, she know she's good,
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!

[Chorus:]
She good like my kinda girl,
She walk like my kinda girl,
She talk like my kinda girl,
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Get in line, get in line
Cause every n*gga in here want you!
