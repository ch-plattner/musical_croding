Though I may speak some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word 
I have no strength with which to speak
When you sit me down and see I’m weak 

We will run and scream 
You will dance with me 
We’ll fulfill our dreams and we’ll be free 

We will run and scream
You will dance with me 
We’ll fulfill our dreams and we’ll be free 

We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars 
Sadness will be far away

So I had done wrong but you put me right 
My judgement burned in the black of night 
When I give less than I take
It is my fault my own mistake

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams and we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
