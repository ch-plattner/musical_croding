She stole my heart and made me sing
She tore me limb from limb
I did not think that I could love
Or be loved that way again

Again, again

How glad I was to be myself
And use my heart once more
How glad I was to be a man
And love that girl that I adore

Adore, adore

Well my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again
Oh my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again
