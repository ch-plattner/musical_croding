There's a chip on your shoulder girl
And by God it'll make you fall
If you let it take a part of your soul

I've seen the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Cause your roots will rot away
And your fruit, it won't grow
Your bark will wear thin, body hollow

I've seen the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground

But, don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground

Well, love your ground

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
