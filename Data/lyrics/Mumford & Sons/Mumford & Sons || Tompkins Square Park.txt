[Verse 1:]
Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time

And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight

[Hook 1:]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

[Verse 2:]
Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time

But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2:]
And we can talk it round again girl
Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it out to die
Leave it out just leave it out

[Bridge:]
I never tried to trick you babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind

[Hook 3:]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
