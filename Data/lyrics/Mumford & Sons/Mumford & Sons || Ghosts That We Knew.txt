
You saw my pain washed out in the rain
Broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart

But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
We'll live a long life

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
'Cause oh that gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

So lead me back, turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
'Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
'Cause oh that gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

But hold me still, bury my heart on the coals
But hold me still, bury my heart on the coals [Live and US versions say "And hold me still, bury my heart next to yours"]

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
'Cause oh that gave me such a fright
But I will hold on as long as you like [Live and US versions say "But I will hold on with all of my might"]
Just promise me we'll be alright

[Live and US versions' additional lines:
"But the ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life"]
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
