
Just give me a second darling
To clear my head
Just put down the scissors baby, on this single bed
The sand in the hourglass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind
The rain, and the snow
To find you awake by your windowsill
A sight for sore eyes and a view to kill

I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon
Shone through cracks in your hair.
I shouted with passion,
"I love you so much"
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch.
You whispered, "Where are you?"
I questioned your doubt
But soon realized, you were talking to God now.

But, you have blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to

I looked in the mirror
Bust something was wrong.
I saw you behind but my reflection was gone.
There was smoke in the fireplace 
As white as the snow.
A voice beckoned gently,
"Now it's time to go"
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
"Don't touch me," I screamed,
"I've got unfinished business!"

But, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to

Cause, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to
