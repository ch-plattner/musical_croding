I will not fall
Once more I'm called
Time comes for all
Then dark is whole

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

I will not speak of your sin
There is a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are shot

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness
