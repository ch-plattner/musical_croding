[Verse 1:]
Weekend wreckers take the streets
With abandon in their eyes
But in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat
And never so alive

[Hook:]
And I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again

[Verse 2:]
Now look at you all torn up
I left you waiting to bleed
I guess the truth works two ways
Maybe the truth's not what we need

[Hook]

But in my cold arms
You don't sleep
In my cold arms
Your fear beats
In my cold arms
You stay
