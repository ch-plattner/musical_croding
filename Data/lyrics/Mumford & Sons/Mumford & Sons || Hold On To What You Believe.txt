
I, I can't promise you
That I won't let you down
And I, I can't promise you
That I will be the only one around when your hope falls down

But we're young,
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world.
And love,
This city breathes the plague of loving things more than their creators

I ran away
I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast
Casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make

What if I was wrong?
What if I was wrong?
Oh, what if I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

And, oh, hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

And now this land
Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn
The water runs away from me and the halo disappears
I'm not whole when you're not here

So what if I was wrong?
What if I was wrong?
Oh, what if I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

And, oh, hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

So hold on to what you believed in the light
