Someone send a runner through the weather that I’m under for the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner through the weather that I’m under for the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
We must be somewhere in London
We must be loving our lives in the rain
We must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make corrections
Famous angels never come to England
England gets the ones you never need
I’m in a Los Angeles cathedral
Mine is singing out, sing for me
Put an ocean and a river between everybody everbetween everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody everbetween everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else and home
We must be somewhere in London
We must be loving our lives in the rain
We must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make corrections
Famous angels never come to England
England gets the ones you never need
I’m in a Los Angeles cathedral
Mine is singing out, sing for me
Afraid of the house
stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
cause we’re desperate to entertain [x3]
