I ran away in floods of shame
I’ll never tell how close I came
As I crossed the Holland Road
Well you went left and I went right
As the moon hung proud and bright
You would have loved it here tonight

Spin me ‘round just to pin me down on the cover of this strange bed
Spin me ‘round just to pin me down

Wrap up your questions, keep them down
Let the water lead us home
And I was sorry for what I’d done
When you were young, I was not old
But our story was not told
But torn apart by greedy hands

Spin me ‘round just to pin me down on the cover of this strange bed
Spin me ‘round just to pin me down
Spin me ‘round just to pin me down I’ll be gone by the night’s end
Spin me ‘round just to pin me down

I’ll be home in a little while
Lover, I’ll be home [x6]
