
Give me hope in silence
It's easier; It's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gaining, truth be told
But I am not the enemy
it isn't me, the enemy

But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

Give me hope in silence
It's easier; It's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope
In solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below 

But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
