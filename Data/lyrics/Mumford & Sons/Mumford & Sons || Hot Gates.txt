
There is no great thing, to stop and sing
Waiting for the rain
And this perfect pill, it's all too much
On the edge again

Don't look away

Couldn't help but note a cold disdain
In your precious face
Why do you always speak when you have no grace
In your precious face

But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive

Another fragile edge, and a tender sound
And then you went aground
Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight
There's nothing here for you tonight

But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive

Let my blood only run out when my world decides
There is no way out of your only life
So run on, run on!
