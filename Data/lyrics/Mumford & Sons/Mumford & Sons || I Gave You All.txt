
Rip the earth in two with your mind
And seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearms

But close my eyes for a while
And force from the world a patient smile

And how can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
And the blind man sleeps in the doorway his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

Close my eyes for a while
And force from the world a patient smile

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won

And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won, you've won
Well, now you've won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
