
I know that things are broken
And though there’s too many words left unsaid
You say you have spoken
Like the coward I am I hang my head

You lie careless your head on my chest
And don’t even look at me looking my best
And all these things I can’t describe
You would rather I didn’t try

But please don’t cry, you liar
Oh please don’t cry, you liar
Oh please don’t cry, you liar

Oh please don’t cry, you liar
Oh please don’t cry, you liar
Oh please don't cry, you liar

And you lean in for your last kiss
Who in this world could ask me to resist
Your hands cold as they find my neck
Oh this love that I've found, I detest
