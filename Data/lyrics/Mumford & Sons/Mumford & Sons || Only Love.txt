[Verse 1:]
Loneliness and all
I was stuck to the spot without a friend
Alone again

And I hunger and I thirst
For some shiver
For some whispered words
And the promise to come

[Hook 1:]
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end

[Verse 2:]
I didn't fool you but I failed you
In short, made a fool out of you
And a younger heart

And I rage and I rage
But perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you

[Hook 2 x2:]
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end [x2]
