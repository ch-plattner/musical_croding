[Verse 1:]
Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love

Just take a minute take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker then just smoke
But as you left I was calling your name at the night

[Hook 1:]
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me

So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I lent down to kiss you then erased my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long

[Bridge:]
The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2 x2:]
(Why do I keep falling) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling) And young love would keep us young
