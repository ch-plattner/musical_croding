
Since you're been gone now honey life ain't nothing but sad luck days
I begged on my knees now, sugar
You acted like you never knew my name
My friends saw you at the station
I guess you must have missed your train
Tell me is it 'cause you love me, Billy
Or is it just because you love the pain?

[Chorus:]
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
For a debutante you're a real hard woman
But I love you just the same

How come you're sad when I get happy?
Why do you laugh when I want to cry?
Tell me why when I say I need you
You turn around and you say goodbye
Why do you think that a heart's so fragile?
Can you tell me why love's so blind?
Just like a magnet you pull me under
I can't resist you, we're two of a kind

[Chorus:]
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
For a debutante you're a real hard woman
But I love you just the same

Billy, Billy
We're better lovers than friends
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend
There really doesn't have to be a happy end

[Chorus:]
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
For a debutante you're a real hard woman
But I love you just the same

I never said you had to walk on water
Or that I could ever stop the rain
Some times we break up just to make up, baby
And we don't care who's to blame
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
For a debutante you're a real hard woman
But I love you just the same
Billy, Billy
Can we be lovers and friends
Life if like a movie but this ain't pretend
