I've been waiting, standing in the dark for hours
Tryin' to find the faith and the power to get back home to you
It's been a long time, long time since I've seen your face
On and on I could not replace the fire that burns for you

So here's to the good times, here's to the bad
Here's to the memories that we all had
Here's to tomorrow, let yesterday pass us by

Tonight we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time, now
Never feel this way again, starting all over again

Do you remember, remember the odds we were given[
When we had nothing and we thought that was living?
Been such a long, long road, over there

Here's to our old friend who helped us get by
Here's to the dreamers, may dreams never die
If we believe we can all keep the good times alive

Tonight we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time, now
Never feel this way again

Oh, oh, tonight we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time, now
Know whenever we're together, my friends
It's like starting all over again

Tonight we'll be starting all over again
It feels like the first time, now
Never feel this way again

Oh, oh, tonight we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time, now
Know whenever we're together, my friends
It's like starting all over again

I've been waiting, standing in the dark for hours
Tryin' to find the faith and the power
Starting all over again
