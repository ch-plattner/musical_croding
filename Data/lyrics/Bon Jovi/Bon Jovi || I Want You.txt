The last time I saw her 
Was the night she said goodbye 
She said that love's a stranger 
And it's sure to pass you by 
As she packed up her belongings 
She wouldn't look me in the eye 
But I could see a tear roll 
Off her face 
As we both tried so hard 
Not to cry she said 

I never wanted the stars 
I never shot for the moon 
I like them right where they are 
All I wanted was you 
So baby just turn away 
Because I can't face the truth 
All I'm trying to say 
Is all I wanted was you 

I tried so hard to remember 
Where when how why love went away 
I tried to drown myself in pity 
But the whiskey kept calling your name 

I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings 
All the things that money brings 
And the servants to paint the sky blue 
And I worked so hard seven days a week 
And built a fortress for your heart to keep 
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you 

I never wanted the stars 
I never shot for the moon 
I like them right where they are 
All I wanted was you 
So baby just turn away 
Because I can't face the truth 
All I'm trying to say 
Is all I wanted was you 

I may have built for you a dreamhouse 
But never thought you were alone 
I filled the party up with company 
But never made our house a home 
All I got is my guitar these chords and the truth 
All I got is my guitar ... but all I want is you
