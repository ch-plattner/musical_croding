
Now that you're gone, I can see what 
Was going on and how you lied 
When you'd said you'd never love again 

Friends telephone and they say 
You weren't out alone last night 
Can't you see that this broken heart 
Is killing me 

Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 

[Chorus:]
Come back cause I need your love 
Come back got to have your love 
Come back bring your loving back to me 
Come back cause it's been so long 
Come back, and my love's still strong 
Come back bring your loving back to me 

You play with words play with love 
It's just your silly way 
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again 

Now it's too late you walk by 
With another man 
And I stand alone 
Cause I know that you're not coming home 

Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 

[Chorus]

Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 

[Chorus]
