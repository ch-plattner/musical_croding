
I played the part of a broken heart upon a show 
I played that part so lonely and so well 
Thought that love belonged to someone else, not me and you 
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered 
You been bruised 
We both know what it feels like when you lose 
But I'd bet my life on a roll of the dice for you 

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 

I bet you counted all the tears I bet you've cried 
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside 
'Cause it hurt youway too bad to say good-bye 
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test 
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget 
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you 

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 

So, when you feel like jumping 
Just when your heart starts pumping 
When you're stading out on that ledge-staring over the edge 
I'll be there to talk to you down 
I'll be there before you hit the ground 

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 

If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll put through 
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes...
