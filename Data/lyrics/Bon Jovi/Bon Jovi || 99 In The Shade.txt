
I feel I'm burning up with fever 
But the fire's feeling really good tonight 
And it's alright 
I'm gonna see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally 
Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down tonight 
If Gina says it's alright 

I'm gonna see those Senoritas 
Lying under the sun 
They're greasing it up 
With know I want to be their blanket 
Gonna tell every girl 
Hey, baby... You're the one... 

Oh tell the boys I'm on my way 
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet 
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid 
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 

When the sun goes down that's when the street heats up 
Senorita Margarita fills your empty cup tonight - 
She make you feel alright 

A good time here don't cost much money 
Just a little sweet talking and a pretty native honey 
And you're set for life 
Or one hell of a nigth 

I'm gonna see those sons of beaches 
Out there living it up the surf 
And the sand, 
Man that life ain't so tough 
So get me in the action so I can tell 
Every girl she's the one 

Oh tell the boys I'm on my way 
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet 
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid 
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
