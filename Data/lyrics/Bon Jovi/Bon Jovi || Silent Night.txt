
After the smoke clears 
When it's down to you and I 
When the sun appears 
And there's nothing left but goodbyes 
We'll just turn and walk away 
How could we let it end like this 
Just turn and walk away 
Should we seal it with a kiss 

It's too late 
Now you're out and on the run 
It's too late 
Held up in love without a gun 

[Chorus]
Silent night 
We hold up our candle light 
Silent night 
The night our love died 
No words to say 
And we're both too tired to fight 
Just hold me close and don't let go... 

It was all so simple when 
You were to be queen and I'd be your king 
I guess those dreams got lost 
Cause baby you're still you and I'm still me 
Now letting go 
It's always the hardest part to fight 
When we both know 
We're just two more victims of the night 

It's too late 
Too late to wonder why 
Much too late 
To save a love that's died. 

[Chorus]

Just hold me close and don't let me go 

After the smoke cleared 
It was down to you and I 
When the sun appeared 
There was nothing left but goodbyes... 
Silent night
