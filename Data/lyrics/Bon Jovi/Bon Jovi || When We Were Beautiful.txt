The world is cracked
The sky is torn
I’m hanging in
You’re holding on

I can’t pretend
That nothings changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made

Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back… When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let’s go back and find it

Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la 
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la

Some dreams live 
Some will die
But the you and me
Is still alive 

Now am I blessed?
Or am I cursed?
Cause the way we are
Aint the way we were

Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back… When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let’s go back and find it

[Solo]

The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Meant so much more

Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back… When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let’s go back and find it

Back…When we were beautiful
Back…When we were beautiful
Back…When we were beautiful
Back…When we were beautiful

Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la 
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la
