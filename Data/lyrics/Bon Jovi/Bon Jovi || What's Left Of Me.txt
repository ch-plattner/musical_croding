
For thirty odd years I was a newspaper man
I made my living with a pen and a pad
God I miss the smell of paper and the ink on my hands

Been back from the desert for a year or so
I left more in that sand than you'll ever know
Another war was waiting for me when I got back home

In the name of the flag some gave their lives
I'm still living, yeah, Semper Fi
Well, that's my story, what else can I say
Hey, hey

I got a lot to give say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?

Boarded up the house, they left the keys
Foreclosed on my city, rolled up these streets
But I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

They called us "Dirty Harry", we're a punk rock band
Why they sold old CBGB's I don't understand
All thatâ€™s left now are the t-shirts and they come from Japan

I sold my drums to make ends meet
The band broke up, we had to eat
It's the same old shit, it just happens more these days,
Hey, hey

I got a lot to give say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?

Boarded up the house, they left the keys
Foreclosed on my city, rolled up these streets
But I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm a teacher, I'm a farmer, I'm a union man
It's getting hard to make a living in this hard land
We ain't working in our factories, all those jobs went overseas.
Hey, hey.

Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?

I got a lot to give, say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?

Does anybody want to buy or rent,
Take a chance or place a bet?
I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?
