
They should have put her in the movies
My little country - cutie
She's the reason I believe god made blue jeans
I was a slicker from the city
When I met that little filly
I was six feet tall
Till she brought me to my knees
I sold my forghein car for a pick up truck
And have a drink Champaign
now its jack straight up
When you better like Hank here
Or you rather love
What's up?

She put the boy back in cowboy
and I was just a rednecked wanna be
She put the boy back in cowboy
That southern woman made a new man out of me

The transformation was amazing
Even Jesus couldn't save me
Late at night I was such a sight to see
At the rodeo she kissed me
then said"boy don't get too frisky
If you're lucky you might too step home with me"
Yeah I got the boots above
Was dancing high to get a big
i got a big belt buckle trying to rope a cow
For me the ring of fire is this cool as Johnny Cash

She put the boy back in cowboy
Hell,I was just a redneck wanna be
She put the boy back in cowboy
That's southern woman made a new man out of me
That country woman made a new man out of me

She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She's a live wire, bonefire
Desired to be high
She got me high high high

She put the boy back in cowboy
Hell i was just a rednecked wanna be
She put the boy back in cowboy
That country woman

She put the boy back in cowboy
hell I was just a rednecked wanna be
She put the boy back in cowboy
it sure be nice to make your company
That southern woman made a new man out of me
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
