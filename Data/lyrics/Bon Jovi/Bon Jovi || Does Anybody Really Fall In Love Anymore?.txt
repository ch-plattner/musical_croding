I walk down the street
People passing me by
They look you up and down
But they don't look you in the eye
I'm just another stranger in my own hometown
Looking for an angel but heaven can't be found

I said hey, I'm lonely tonight
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna make it through
But that don't make it right

Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really ever open that door
You've gotta to find somebody
I've got to find somebody to love

There's a sad face in the mirror
I'm sad to say it's me
Like a ghost up in the attic
Only love can set him free
I've been running 'round in circles
On this roller coaster ride
There's a lonely world around us
We get sucked in by the tide

I said hey, love ain't no crime
So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line

Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really ever open that door
I've got to find somebody to love
Find me someone to love

[Solo]

I said hey, I'll be alright
Because I know that someone, somewhere
Is gonna say those words tonight

Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really ever open that door
I've got to find somebody...
