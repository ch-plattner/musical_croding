Yesterdays a memory
Another page in history
You sell yourself on hopes and dreams 
That leaves you feeling sideways.
Tripping over my own feet 
Trying to walk to my own beat
Another car out on the street trying to find the Highway 
Yeah, Are you going my way?

[Chorus]
This is the story of my life 
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white 
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos 
Anything can, everything can happen 
That's the story of my life

I gonna write the melody 
That's gonna make history, 
And when I paint my masterpiece I swear I'll show you first 
There just ain't a way to see who and why or what will be 
Till now is then 
It's a mystery, it's a blessing and a curse 
Or something worse

[Chorus]

This is the story of my life 
And I write it everyday, 
And I hope you're by my side when I'm writing the last page

[Chorus x2]
