Riding high, then shot down 
I load my guns to fire another round 
I look deep into your eyes 
And can't run there's nowhere left to hide 
Don't stop, no it's much too late 
When the night comes I can't wait 
Oh I live, love to loose control 
It makes me crazy I want to let you know 

[Chorus:]
Oh, no, I don't want to fall 
Oh, oh, can't you hear me calling 
All night long in my secret dreams 
You tell me I'm the one 
When I'm next to you -- next to you. 
All I want in my secret dreams 
Is you here with me. 
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you. 

There's a thrill, in the chase 
We won't lose when we meet face to lace. 
Love, games a means without and end. 
I go down but I'll be back again 
Thru' the night with no retreat 
When you're with me in my sleep. 

[Chorus]

I can see you 
I feel you every night 
I need you 
But I'm only dreaming 
All night long in my secret dreams 
You tell me I'm the one 
When I'm next to you -- next to you. 
All I want in my secret dreams 
Is you here with me.
