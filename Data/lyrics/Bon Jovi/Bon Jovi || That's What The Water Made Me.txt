Baby, baby, baby
There's no use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell
So, blow me one last kiss
And wish me well, well

Love is like fingerprints
They don't wash away.
I left mine all over you.
I take the blame.

Ask me how
Ask me what
Ask me why, baby

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water made me

This world is cracked and crazy.
Say one of your pretty prayers for me.
No rose in the garden
Or wish in the well.

I don't know how
Don't know what
Don't know why, baby

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
That's what the water, that's what the water...

Ask me how,
Ask me what,
Ask me why...

Baby, baby, baby
There's no use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell

(Hold me close, hold me close, hold me)

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water...
