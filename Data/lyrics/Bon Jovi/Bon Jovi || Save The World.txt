I never went to college 
I don't have a degree 
Let's say I went to night school 
I learned all I know on the streets 
I wasn't born a rich man 
I ain't got no pedigree 
The sweat on this old collar 
That's my Ph.D. 

It comes down to this 
I wouldn't exist 
Without you it ain't worth the grind 
I'd fight for one kiss 
On a night like this 
You make me feel I could fly, like 

[Chorus:]
I could save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Maybe I could save the world 

I got to confess 
Sometimes I'm a mess 
And sometimes I step out of line 
Like this old tattoo 
I ain't shiny or new 
With you by my side nothing matters 

[Chorus:] 
I can save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Maybe I can save the world 

[Guitar solo ]

They can say it's blind love 
But it's a fool who don't believe 
That I'd fly all the way to the moon 
Just to walk you down your street 

[Chorus:] 
I can save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Our love is even stronger 
Than god hoped it could be 
Baby, all it takes is 
Just a little faith in me 
To feel like 
I can save the world 
I can save the world
