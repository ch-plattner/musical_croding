
When you're afraid
And it feels like you're too tired to fight
Even your heart don't know if you're still alive
Man, you never felt so all alone
In this world tonight

And I, don't you know that I felt the same?
I've seen this storm, I've been through the rain
You've gotta know that I feel your pain
Don't be afraid

When you're on the edge
I will rescue you
When you need a friend
I'll be there for you

I'm nobody's hero
For you I'd lay down my life
Nobody's hero
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky

If you would lean on me
Baby, dream on me
You can bleed on me
Just believe in me
Nobody's hero

Well, out on these streets
They're waiting for blind eyes to see
They're waiting for our cuts to bleed
Out here they're waiting for you and me

Well, alright, alright
'Cause this time you know I ain't afraid to fight
For you I ain't afraid to die
As long as you are by my side it will be alright

When all faith is gone
I will pray for you
Just keep holding on
I'll be there for you

I'm nobody's hero
But for you I'd lay down my life
Nobody's hero
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky

If you lean on me
You can bleed on me
Baby, dream on me
Just believe in me
Nobody's hero

I'm nobody's hero
But for you I'd lay down my life
Nobody's here
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky

If you lean on me
You can bleed on me
Baby, dream on me
Just believe in me
I'm nobody's hero

Nobody's hero
Baby, lean on me
You can dream on me
Just bleed on me
Just believe in me
