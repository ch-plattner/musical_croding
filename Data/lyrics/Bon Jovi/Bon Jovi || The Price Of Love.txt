One heart one other 
They met last summer 
One move she started 
Now they love this way 
The pain of pleasure 
Lying together 
You're at their mercy 
As the telephone' ringing on 

No one said there'd be nights like this 
Risk your life for a stolen kiss 

[Chorus:]
We live, we learn, we lie 
For the price of love 
We kiss then say goodbye 
For the price of love 
We live, we learn, we lie 
For the price of love 
We kiss then say goodbye 
For the price of love 

Each move goes so slow 
Until the doors close 
No secret codes now 
No words as baby goes down 
One last dance then goodbye 
Practicing his love lies 
He runs to his wife 
And your left holding the knife 

You live your life to take that chance 
When your a master of the art of romance 
And you know you won't cross that line 
Until that last slow dance 

[Chorus]

Alone our lonely hearts would die. 
It's all in the game 
And the way that it's played 
There's no time to wonder why 
To catch you when you fall 
Answer when you call 
No one can hear you cry 

[Chorus]
