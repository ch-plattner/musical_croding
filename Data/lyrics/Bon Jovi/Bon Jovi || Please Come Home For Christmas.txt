
Bells will be ringing, the glad, glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
(My baby's gone)
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Those Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
(Please come home)

Please come home for Christmas
(Please come home)
If not for Christmas by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Just as sure as the stars shine above
(Yes, they do)
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one that you love

Then won't you tell me?
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year
(Christmas and New Year's)

Will find you at home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again
(Happy)
