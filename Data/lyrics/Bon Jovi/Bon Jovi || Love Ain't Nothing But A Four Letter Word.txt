
She was waiting alone at the station
Praying for her train to arrive
Thinking 'bout her destination
The tattered bag had all she had in life

She turned her back on her family
She turned her back on her friends
She turned her back on a married man
When she took off that wedding band

She said, "I'm giving up, silver clouds have turned to gray
Had enough, there's got to be a better way"
Giving up, you know you've gotta walk
There's some things in life still worth fighting for

Ain't no big secret so forget all you've heard
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing

This time he said was the last time
Last time he said just the same
In your heart you know that they'll be a next time
That your battered bones would have to explain

Giving up, nothing's changing but the score
Had enough, every night love turns to war
Give it up, gave it all and wanted more
It ain't nothing worth dying for

It's no big secret so forget all you've heard
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing

Forget your mama's Rosary beads
To get you through this time of need
You know you gotta cross that line
You take it one day at a time

Had enough, the silver clouds all turning gray
I'm heading for a better day

It's no big secret so forget all you've heard
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word

Love ain't nothing, it ain't nothing now, baby
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing, nothing now, baby
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word

Love ain't nothing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word

Love ain't nothing
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word

Love ain't nothing
