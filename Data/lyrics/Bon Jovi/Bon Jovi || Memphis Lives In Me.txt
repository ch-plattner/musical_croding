
There's a town that I call home
Where all the streets are paved with soul
Down on Beale there's a honky-tonk bar
So hear the wail of a blues guitar
Have a beer and drop a dime in the blind man's jar

The blues sing softly in the air
Like a Sunday morning prayer
Just one more drink and
And you'll see God everywhere

Like a sad old melody
That cheers you up, it sets you free
And that's how Memphis lives in me

There comes a time when muddy waters run rough
There comes a point when a man has had enough
Like a friend that always stands by me

Memphis knows me never showed me
How did life just had to be
I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye
Here I was born and here is where I'll die

I'm just a man from Tennessee
I can't be what I can't be
All I know is Memphis lives in me

I said, "I'm just a man from Tennessee"
Can't be what I can't be
All I know is Memphis lives
All I know is Memphis gives
All I know is Memphis in me
