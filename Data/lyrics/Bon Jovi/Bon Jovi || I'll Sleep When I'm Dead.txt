Seven days of saturday 
Is all that I need 
Got no use for Sunday 
'Cause I don't rest in peace 
Don't need no Mondays 
Or the rest of the week 
I spend a lot of time in bed 
But baby I don't like to sleep no 

I won't lie to you 
I'm never gonna cry to you 
I'll probably drive you wild 8 days a week 

Until I'm 6 feet under 
Baby I don't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 

So you're looking for some action 
I got got everything you need 
Better keep your motor running 
'cause I was built for speed 
This ain't no slumber party 
Got no time for catching z's 
If they say that that ain't healthy 
Well then living's a disease 

We're never going to die baby 
Come on let me drive you crazy 
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve 

Till I'm six feet under 
I won't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 

Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead 
Gonna live while I'm alive, 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Seven days of Saturday 
Is all that I need 

Got no use for Sunday 
'Cause I don't rest in peace 
I was born to live 
You know I wasn't born to die 
But if they party down in heaven 
I'll be sure to be on time 

Until I'm six feet under 
I don't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 

I feel like I'm exploding 
Going out of my head 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 

Till I'm six feet under 
And they lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 

Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead 
Gonna live while I'm alive, sleep when I'm dead
