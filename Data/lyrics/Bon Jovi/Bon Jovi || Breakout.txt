This time girl I've had enough 
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves 
It's too late I hear a knock on the door 
The game's over baby I can't take it no more 

[Chorus:]
Breakout, Breakout 
Take these chains from me 
You held my heart for ransom 
Baby, set it free 
Breakout, Breakout 
Your lies can't hide what I see 
I'm better off on my own 

Promises made me in the heat of the night (Whoa-oh-oh) 
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (Whoa-oh) 
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (Whoa-oh) 
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (Whoa-oh) 

[Chorus]

You say we'll meet around midnight 
You're gonna make me feel oh so right 
I'm saying oh no not tonight 
You gotta let me go 

[Chorus]

You say we'll meet around midnight 
You're gonna make me feel oh so right 
I'm saying oh no not tonight 
You gotta let me go
