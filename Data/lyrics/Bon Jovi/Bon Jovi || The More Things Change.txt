The More Things Change the more the stay the same 
The more things change the more the stay the same 

Ah, is it just me or does anybody see 
The new improved tomorrow isn't what it used to be 
Yesterday keeps comin' 'round, it's just reality 
It's the same damn song with a different melody 
The market keeps on crashin' 

Tattered jeans are back in fashion 
'Stead of records, now it's MP3s 
I tell you one more time with feeling 
Even though this world is reeling 
You're still you and I'm still me 
I didn't mean to cause a scene 
But I guess it's time to roll up our sleeves 

The more things change the more they stay the same 
The same sunrise, it's just another day 
If you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back 
Just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact 
You know the more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 

You're either runnin' round in circles or you're runnin' out of time 
Everybody somewhere either 12, 3, 6 or 9 
The times they are a-changin' 
We're here to turn the page 
It's the same old story but it's told a different way 

The more things change the more they stay the same 
The same sunrise, it's just another day 
If you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back 
Just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact 
You know the more things change the more they stay the same 
Never and forever just keep comin' back again 
Don't hold out for tomorrow or hold onto yesterday 

The more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 

Here comes a na na na na na na na 
These days it's the raise the roof instead of sha la la 
Here come the rockers, the dancers and the remixed drum machine 
This one is for the CEOs and record companies 
And if you're waitin' on a happy ending 
We're gonna hit the hook one more time 

The more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 
The more things change the more they stay the same 

You know the more things change the more they stay the same 
The same sunrise, it's just another day 
If you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back 
Just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact 
You know the more things change the more they stay the same 
Never and forever just keep comin' back again 
Don't hold out for tomorrow or hold onto yesterday 
The more things change the more they stay the same

Whoa oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh
