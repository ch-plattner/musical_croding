I wish that life was like it is in the movies
'Cause the hero always gets his way
No matter how hard it gets on that dark lonely road
At the end he's got a smile on his face

But when they threw me out to the lions
No one saved me as I fell from your grace
And no one wrote me new lines for what I said wrong
And what I did wrong I could not erase

And this is real life, this is real love
This is real pain, that much I'm sure of
These are real tears
These are real fears, inside that I can't hide

I wish that I could be your white knight in armor
With an army just to bring you back home
But I'll admit I'm scared of dialing your number
But someone else is gonna answer the phone
Why can't it be like it is on TV?
When the orchestra plays and you come back to me

This is real life, this is real love
This is real pain, that much I'm sure of
These are real tears
These are real fears, inside, I can't hide

This real life, this real love
These are real wounds I'm bleeding from
And I realize this is real

I always thought that our love was a storybook tale
God knows that I'd never dreamed in the end it would fail

This is real life, this is real love
This is real pain, that much I'm sure of
These are real tears
These are real fears, inside, I can't hide

This real life, this is real love
These are real wounds I'm bleeding from
And I realize this is real
