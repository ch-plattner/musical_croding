I feel just like Picasso
And you're my masterpiece
I painted you a lifetime
Now what's left are memories
Oooh

Sunlight's in the curtains
Diamonds in the trees
I gave you colors blue and gold
As you lay upon the sheets
Something so familiar drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures of you

I could almost smell your perfume
In each brush stroke of the flowers
I left you tea from China
Waiting in your sacred tower
Something so familiar drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures of you

If I should go crazy, if I would go blind
I'd still fill the canvas from the pictures in my mind
If that's the only way to make you mine

It was something so familiar
Drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures, I'm always painting pictures
Still painting pictures of you

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh...
