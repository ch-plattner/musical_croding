
Are you out there? Can you hear me?
Do you know my whereabouts?
Do you know what I'm all about?
Through the static
You're so close, so far away

Are you listening? I'm desperate
Sendin' out an SOS
'Cause I'm lost, I must confess
Throw a lifeline, I'm down here
Drownin' in the deepest part of me

Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight?
I need to know you're out there

Your lines open and receiving?
You know I got so much to say
I just don't wanna fade away
Keep on talkin' 'cause you're keepin' me alive

Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight?
I need to know you're out there

Everybody hurts
Everybody cries
Everybody needs someone
To save them sometimes

Everybody hurts
Everybody cries
Everybody needs someone
To save them sometimes
Save them sometimes

Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me

Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight?
I need to know you're out there

Satellite
