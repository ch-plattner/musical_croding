A penny for your thoughts now, baby
Tell me what you see
You know I want to play with you but this ain't hide and seek with Me
Can't you see

I know your mama don't approve of what I'm thinking of
You give me just the little things but it just ain't enough

You say stop, I say go
I say yeah, you say no, no, no, no, no
I just can't wait, girls like you start much too late
And oh, you can't save me now

You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together with the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Whoa, full moon high

Pretend I'm Valentino and you're a beauty queen
Pretend we're in some movie instead of faded jeans
You and me, we're the same
Just believe there's so much more to see
Oh, baby, save me now

You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together with the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Whoa, full moon high

[Solo]

You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together with the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Whoa, full moon high
Full moon high
Baby, you and I
Full moon high
