There are days when she's a whisper 
Nights when she's a scream 
A reason to wake up in the morning 
To close your eyes and dream 
She'll curse you like a sailor 
She'll wound you with her eyes 
She always makes it better 
But she won't apologize 
I know everything about her but don't know her at all 

[Chorus: ]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place you've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
You're not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
Mystery train 

She cries because she's happy 
She sings songs when she's mad 
Like a stiff drink when you need it 
She's good at being bad 
And long before you knew her you knew she was the one 

[Chorus: ]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place you've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
You're not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
Mystery train 

[Solo ]

I know everything about her but don't know her at all 

[Chorus:]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place I've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
I'm not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
On a mystery train 
She's a ride 
On a mystery train
