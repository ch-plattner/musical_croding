
Silver bullet in the wild blue
Crack in the walls I'm coming through
Think you can stop me, well, take a look in these eyes

You can't cage what you can't tame
There ain't no rules, this ain't a game
There's no way to stop the fire inside, yeah

You can escape a pouring rain
You can run for shelter in a hurricane
Change your face, lose your name
Lie about things you can't explain
But there's one thing that you cannot deny

The fire inside, the fire inside
You can run from what's in your blood and you can't hide
From the fire inside, the fire inside

Tonight I'll run, I need no sleep
When it feels this good you're in too deep
In blood I'm gonna write my name, cover my tracks I feel no shame
Just let 'em try and stop the fire inside

The fire inside, the fire inside
You can run from what's in your blood, you can't hide
The fire inside, the fire inside
It's the only way you know you're still alive
The fire inside, the fire inside, yeah

There's no place for me in heaven
Tonight I just might die
There'll be no one to hold my hand, for me no one will cry
There'll be no forgiveness but I'll never deny

The fire inside, the fire inside
You can't run from what's in your blood and you can't hide
The fire inside, the fire inside
It's the only way you know you're still alive
The fire inside, the fire inside

The fire inside, the fire inside
It's the fire inside, the fire inside
The fire inside, the fire inside
