
Love is like quicksand
It's always bringin' me down
I still keep comin' back for more

And like an addiction
One is never enough
I'm like a junkie at your door

Too much of a good thing
Is like getting high and coming down

My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much, too much of a good thing

I came to your party
And stayed a little too late
You woke me naked on the floor

You are my strongest weakness
And I don't want nothin' else
You got the fix I'm looking for

Too much of a good thing
Will turn your whole world upside down

My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much, too much of a good thing

She's my favorite disease
Makes me crawl on my knees
Getting much, too much of a good thing

Like you partied all night
And you're too trashed from drinking
The only way out is another shot glass to sink in
Tell me, baby, what will it take
'Coz I keep makin' the same mistakes

My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much, too much of a good thing

And I know it's no good
Yeah, I'd quit if I could
Getting much, too much
Getting much, too much
Oh, it's just too much of a good thing
