So you want to be a cowboy
Well you know it's more than just a ride
Guess you got to know the real thing
If you want to know the other side
Ain't nobody riding shotgun
In this world tonight

And when you spit, you better mean it
You got to make 'em all believe it
If you're gonna be the one

Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to

So you want to be the big time
Some people have to drag you down
There's no living in the backseat
If you're gonna drive through town
And when you pray for independence
Boy, you better stand your ground

You got to give it all you got now
Or you might get shot down
Fight hard until the battle is won

Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will course you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
But only if you have to

[Solo]

Well, you know that I been through it
I got the scars to prove it
Fight hard and the Battle is yours

Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will course you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to

But stick to your guns
