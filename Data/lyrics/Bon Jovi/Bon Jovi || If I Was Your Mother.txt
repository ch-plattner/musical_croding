
If I was your mother 
Would you let me hold your hand 
Would you say you were my baby 
Would you always be my friend 

If I was your mother 
Could I teach you what's right 
Could I tell you stories 
Maybe tuck you in 
And kiss you sweet goodnight 

Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was your mother 

Would you always believe me 
'Cause I'd wake up in the middle 
Of the night 
Just to see if you need me 

Tell me there's no mother 
To who you're telling your secrets 
And would you tell me 
'Bout all the boys you been 
Bringing home to meet me 

Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was yours 

Mother, mother 
If I was your 
Mother, mother 

When love is blood 
You're never on trial 
Love don't get deeper 
Than a mother & child 
Oh baby, I got to get that 
Close to you 

Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was yours 

Tell me what I got to be 
To make you a part of me 
There's no one else you'd ever need 
If I was your 

Mother, mother 
If I was your mother 
Mother, mother 

Mother, mother 
If I was your mother 
Mother, mother
