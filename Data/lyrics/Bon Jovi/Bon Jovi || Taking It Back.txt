
I’ve been away so long, I knew the place
It’s been too long since I’ve been around
Just like I rolling stone, I ain’t got no home
But my boys are back in town, kick it

It’s been two long years that I’ve been on the run
From lawyers, lovers, monies and a lawman’s son
You thought it was the last you heard from me
Well, you better back up to catch up with me

‘Cause I’m livin’ in the fast lane
Speeding like a steam train
Just before I fall, just before I fall off the track

Taking it back
I’m taking it back

Taking it back
You took it away, took it away
All I can say is we’re taking it back

I’m the same old dog that I used to be
The word’s all over town that you’ve been looking for me
I’m no different that I was before
Give you what you need and then I’m out the door

‘Cause I’m livin’ in the fast lane
Coming like a hurricane
A snake without a rattle, baby
That’s a matter of fact, yeah

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back
You took it away, took it away
All I can say is we’re taking it back

I’ve been away so long, it’s good to see your face
Barkeep, won’t you buy me a round?
Raise a glass to the good times past
Then we’ll tear this damn place down

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back, Lord
Taking it back, all right

Taking it back
Taking it back
