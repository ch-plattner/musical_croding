
She won't let me buy her jewelry 
She don't want things that she can keep 
She wears wildflowers in her hair 
Then throws them in the sea 
She's the beginning and the end of me 

[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
I will never understand her 
She's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 

I still don't know what to call her 
She says that words don't mean a thing 
She changes her name every day 
And lies all the time 
I feel lucky to call her mine 

[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
I will never understand her 
She's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 

She's anything in the world 
That you cannot explain 
But when she throws me a smile 
It's fire in the rain 

[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
'Cause she's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 

She's a mystery 
There's no defense 
It's innocence 
But she won't let you see
'Cause she's a mystery
