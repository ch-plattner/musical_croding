I used to believe but now it's just one day at a time
The circus is gone, it's all packed away
The clown's hat, the makeup's been packed in his case

So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn

I used to laugh but I've learned to cry
And I ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes
For all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here

I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing

But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth
When innocence sang his last song
He'd tell me that it's all gone
Just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at all

I used to live, I've learned to die
And I used to dream, I used to dream

So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we've never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The stars that we reached for, they've left us with nothing but dawn

Oh yeah
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak
A handful of blues
Oh yeah
I'll never get off these
