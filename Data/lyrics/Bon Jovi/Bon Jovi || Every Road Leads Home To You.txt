
I got your picture on my phone
Your voice in my head
I'm lying here alone
Restless in some faraway bed
The stars will falling down
And I'm half a world away
I'm just trying to close the distance
To feel each breath you take

When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
And every road leads home to you,
Home to you

So you got me to believe
Made me turn on a dime
The writing on the wall
Right in front of me
Every song, every rhyme

But I don't need a thousand words
I need you save in my arms
I'll be standing strong
I'll keep holding on
When life tries tearing us apart

When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew

No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you

Home,
Roads still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs
The Headlights make me blind
The Roads still leads me home to you

When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
Everything I thought I knew

No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you

Home to you
Home to you
Home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you
Every road
Leads home to you
Every road leads home to you.
