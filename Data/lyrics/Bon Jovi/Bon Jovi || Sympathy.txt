
Well, you walked out the door just like a thief in the night
I guess you never even had the balls to say goodbye
You stole my heart and you took all the cash
You split with my soul and my stereo, left me with the trash

I never been nobody's valentine and you never were a bride to be
I don't need you to be a friend of mine, I don't need charity

Don't' come knockin' on my back door
Love ain't livin' 'round here no more
I don't want to taste your empathy

I don't want no sympathy
I don't need your sympathy, baby
Don't want no sympathy
I don't need your sympathy, baby

I bet you're out on the streets, wrapped up in somebody's arms
Until it's time to pay the rent, you'll be gone, gone, gone
You got a suicide heart, you send it COD
Honey, I know your act
When you're sending it back don't come bitchin' to me

Who said love is just a sacrifice was a man in need of sympathy
Yes, it  don't take too long to realize that you ain't getting none from me

Don't come knockin' on my back door
Love ain't living 'round here no more
I don't want to taste your empathy

I don't want your sympathy
I don't need your sympathy, baby
Don't want no sympathy
I don't need your sympathy, baby

When I look back in time I see love ain't been no friend to me
I never been nobody's valentine and you never were a bride to be

Don't come knockin' on my back door
Love ain't livin' 'round here no more
Count up all the tears you've cried for me

Don't come knockin' on my back door
Love ain't livin' round here no more
I don't wanna taste your charity

I don't want no sympathy
I don't need no sympathy, baby
Don't want no sympathy
I don't need your sympathy, baby

I want no sympathy
I don't need no sympathy
I don't like no sympathy
I don't need your sympathy
Sympathy, sympathy, sympathy, sympathy
