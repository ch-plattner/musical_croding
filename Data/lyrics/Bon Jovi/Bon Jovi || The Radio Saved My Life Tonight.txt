I got somethin' on my mind, I'm just a little bit depressed
I try to blame it on the rain but it was in my heart, I guess
I'm feelin' like a stranger when I drove through my hometown
Past the sign that reads 'The Boyhood Home
Of a Place That's Long Gone Now'

I realized ain't nothin' what it used to be
Until I heard a song that takes me to my memories

Radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
I made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

Just this side of mornin', just this side of dawn
I walked so soft into my bedroom, saw my wife sleepin' alone
She whispered, "Baby, are you okay, have you been gone for long?"
I just kicked off my jeans and held her close, I held her all night long

I tried to sleep but in my mind I heard that song
Like a friend in need, the melody keeps me hangin' on

Radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
I made it home by my dashboard light
Radio saved my life tonight

The radio saved my life tonight
The sad song that the DJ played made me feel alright
As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

Radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
I made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
