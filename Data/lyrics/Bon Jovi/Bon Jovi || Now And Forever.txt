
It's been a long time, baby, how've you been?
Oh, it sure feels good to see you again, my friends
I still remember just like it's yesterday
Though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away
And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know

Kings will be kings with crown to defend
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end
Dreams will be dreams but friends will be friends
Now and forever, now and forever

I still remember when you didn't know my name
We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same
God, I wanna stay, but you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways
But when your radio's on, and you're hearing this song
I hope that you'll say nothing's changed

Kings will be kings with crown to defend
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end
Dreams will be dreams but friends will be friends
Now and forever, now and forever

[Solo]

Kings will be kings with crown to defend
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end
Dreams will be dreams but friends will be friends
Now and forever, now and forever
