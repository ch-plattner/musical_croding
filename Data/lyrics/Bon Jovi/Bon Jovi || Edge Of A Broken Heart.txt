
And there I stood just like a soldier
I was tough until I saw her
I said hello but she just turned away
Hey Romeo, whatchya doin' with my girl?
Who are you using now? I turn and walk away
I'm gonna please her
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch her when she falls

[Chorus:]
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can 'cause you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

I'm on the outside, looking inside
You're with him, whose on the wrong side now?
Do you still think of me?
I've tried to call but no one answers
Two silhouettes, a private dancer
The lights go dim as the music starts to fade away
I'm the one who needs you
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch you when you fall

[Chorus:]
You better believe I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
And we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can 'cause you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

And when I hold out my hands
I'll be reaching for you
I give it all that I've got
That's all I can do
When you're waiting for love
I'll be waiting for you

[Chorus:]
On the edge of a broken heart (on the edge of a broken heart)
Only for you (on the edge of a broken heart)
