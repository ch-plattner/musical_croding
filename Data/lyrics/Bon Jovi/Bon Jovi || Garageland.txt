
I read the paper just the other day
About a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave
They say he went in his sleep
With a smile on his face
Bet he was dreaming 'bout those better days
When the crash of the drums
Hit like the waves on a beach
That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams
We were searching for a savior like anybody else
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves

[Chorus:]
Just a garage band
We weren't alive
We were livin' in Garageland

Our parents all held jobs but we had other plans
We acted like our heroes
They just didn't understand
We were never afraid to fall
It was us and those four walls

[Chorus:]
Just a Garage band
We weren't alive
We were livin' in Garageland

Nothing else felt so right
Just us, those guitars
And a Saturday night

[Chorus:]
Just a Garage band
We weren't alive
We were livin' in Garageland

Nothing else felt so right
Just us, those guitars
