
We walked through the sunshine, we walked thru the rain
As endless as time the thoughts will remain
We'll take what we want
You take what you need
We are the targets, you better believe
No one can save you, there's nothing to say
Deception's the name of the game

[Chorus:]
We rule the night
Only the strong will survive
There's no wrong, there's no right
We rule the night
We rule the night

We'll never give up the fight
Where the wrong is alright
We rule the night
All is for one and one is for all
If we take the fight then you take the fall
You run from the shadows but they call my name
You search for the truth but your search is in vain
No one can save you, there's nothing to say
Deception's the name of the game

[Chorus:]
We rule the night
Only the strong will survive
There's no wrong, there's no right
We rule the night
We rule the night
We'll never give up the fight
Where the wrong is alright
We rule the night
We rule the night
We rule the night
We rule the night
