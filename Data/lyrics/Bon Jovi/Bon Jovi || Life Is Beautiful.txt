
Try to walk on water
You'll sink just like a stone
Said you'd get home early
But you always stay too long
You got all the answers, but the answers are all wrong

I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray
You fly you fall
Life is beautiful

She's there to lift me up
But I only let her down
A guilty king
Wears a broken crown
She's sweet forgiveness
In a lonesome lost and found

I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray
You fly you fall
Life is beautiful

New gets old
The night gets cold
The sad goodbye
Life is beautiful

The sky is cracked
We can't go back
Dry your eyes
Life is beautiful

I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray

New gets old
The night get cold
The sad goodbye
Life is beautiful

The sky is cracked
We can't go back
Dry your eyes
Life is beautiful

Life is beautiful
