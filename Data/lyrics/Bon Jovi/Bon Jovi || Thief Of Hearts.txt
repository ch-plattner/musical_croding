
You can lock up all the doors
Pull up the covers turn out the lights
I'll know where you are it's alright

You can go ahead and hide
You know you can't keep me out
I'll find my way I'm here to stay
Even the cops can't save you now

Hey baby there's nothing you can do
Hey baby it isn't up to you

'Cause I am the thief of hearts
Don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part, I'm the thief of hearts
I've come to steal your love

I'm the thief of hearts
You can hold on to your heart
You ain't gonna win
So, go ahead and draw the blinds
I'm still coming in

Hey baby I'm gonna wear you down
Hey baby you better listen to me now

I'm the thief of hearts
The shadow on your wall
A whisper in your ear
A footsteps in the hall

I'm the thief of hearts
Don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part, I'm the thief of hearts
I'm gonna steal your love

I'm the thief of hearts
And hey, baby there's nothing you can do
And hey, baby You know there ain't no use

I am the thief of hearts
Guilty of the charge
You can throw away the keys
And double up the bars

I am the thief of hearts
And don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part, I'm the thief of hearts
I'm gonna steal your love

I'm the thief of hearts
I'm the thief of hearts
I'm the thief of hearts
