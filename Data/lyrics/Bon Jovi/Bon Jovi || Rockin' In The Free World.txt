
There's colors on the street 
Red, white and blue 
People shufflin' their feet 
People sleepin' in their shoes 
But there's a warming sign on the road ahead 
There's lot of people sayin' we'd better off dead 
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them 
So I try to forget it, any way I can. 

Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 

I see a woman in the night 
With a baby in her hand 
Under an old street light 
Near a garbage can 
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit 
he hates her life and what she's done to it 
There's one more kid that will never go to school 
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool 

Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 

We got a thousand points of light 
For the homeless man 
We got a kinder, gentler, 
Machine gun hand 
We got department stores and toilet paper 
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer 
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive 
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive 

Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world
