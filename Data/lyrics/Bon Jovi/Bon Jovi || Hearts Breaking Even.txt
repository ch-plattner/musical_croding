
It's been a cold, cold, cold, cold night 
And I can't get you off of my mind 
God knows I've tried 
Did I throw away the best part of my life 
When I cut you off 
Did I cut myself with the same damn knife 
Hide my tears in the pouring rain 
Had my share of hurt and pain 
Don't say my name, run away, 'cause it's all in vain 

My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight 

It's been a long, long, long, long time 
Since I've had your love here in my hands 
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it 
But, nothing's fair in love and hate 
You lay it all down and walk away, before it's too late 
We danced all night as the music played 
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made 
There in the stains, we remain 
No one left to blame 

My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight 

Go on, get on with your life 
Yeah - I'll get on with mine 
Broken hearts can't call the cops 
Yeah - it's a perfect crime 
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning 
I'm burning alive 
I'm paying the price again 
But I'll see the light again 

My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight
