
What's the world coming to
Where are we all running to
Not all our dreams are coming true
We can't let it break us
In two hearts that beat as one
Can't let the clouds cover the sun
If I'm ramblin' I'm guilty
Of wearing my heart on my sleeve
When it hurts - BREATHE
When it burns - BREATHE
The feeling inside you is feeling like I do
Take a breath - BREATHE
Let it out - BREATHE
Just close your eyes don't hold it inside you
BREATHE
She said baby you look down tonight
There's something wrong and that ain't right
I hear you talking in your sleep
I want to dive in your dreams
And wrap my loving arms around you
Protect you when the waves crash down on you
When you're lost and you're scared
I'll be the air
When it hurts - BREATHE
When it burns - BREATHE
The feeling inside you is feeling like I do
Take a breath - BREATHE
Let it out - BREATHE
Just close your eyes don't hold it inside you
BREATHE

When you give and you take
And it feels like something breaks
It's alright -BREATHE
When it hurts - BREATHE
When you doubt - BREATHE
When it burns - BREATHE
Let it out - BREATHE
When you give - BREATHE
When you love - BREATHE
When you live - BREATHE
When you touch - BREATHE
If all that we've got is each other
Than all that we got is a lot
When it hurts - BREATHE
When it burns - BREATHE
The feeling inside you is feeling like I do
Take a breathe - BREATHE
Let it out - BREATHE
Just close your eyes don't hold it inside you
