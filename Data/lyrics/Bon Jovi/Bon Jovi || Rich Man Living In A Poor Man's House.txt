Billy works too hard, trying to make ends meet
He's gotta pay his credit cards
Yeah, he's been dealing with the odds
That even Vegas can't beat

By six he's out of bed, she makes his coffee sweet
He grabs his boots and his coat
Leaves a note that says, 'I love you'
And runs to catch a bus down at the end of market street

It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house

Every night at home, feels like it's Christmas Eve
And Gracie's got his dinner on the stove, Daddy's coming home
And they've got seven hungry children
That are tugging on his sleeve

It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house

He arrives at nine as the work bell's ringing
And he hits the grind but his heart is singing, yeah

Some men live for money, some men live for work
But it's a real man, richer man who knows what love's worth

It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house

Sha la la la la la la la
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh yeah, hey
