
I can still remember 
When I was just a kid 
When friends were friends forever 
And what you said was what you did 

Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby 
We cut each other's hands 
And held tight to a promise 
Only brothers understand 

But we were so young (so young) 
One for all and all for one (for one) 
Just as sure as the river's gonna run 

Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all was said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood 

Well, Bobby was our hero 
Cause he had a fake I.D. 
I got busted stealing cigarettes 
And he took the rap for me 

Danny knew this white trash girl 
We each threw in a ten 
She took us to this cheap motel 
And turned us into men 

We were so young (so young) 
One for all and all for one (for one) 
Just as sure as the river's gonna run 

Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all is said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood

Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer 
Danny, he's a medicin man 
And me, I'm just the singer 
In a long haired rock'n'roll band 

Through the years and miles between us 
It's been a long and lonely ride 
But if I got a call in the dead of the night 
I'd be right by your side 

Blood on blood, blood on blood 

Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all is said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood 

Blood on blood
