
If I, I could be anyone, could I, I be your only one?
If I, I could be anything could I be the secret that you keep
Breath that you breathe your dreams while you sleep?

If you, if you could read my mind
Then you, you'd now I crossed that line
I'd make you my Valentine
I can't let you go but I know
That this ring is there to remind

So let's re-enact that scene
From what's his name's one act play
I'll be your hero and you'll be the one who got away

Now I'm chasing headlights back home
And you, you're sitting there on your own
When we were sippin' martinis
I started believing I wouldn't be leaving alone

When I told you a joke and you laughed
When I asked you to dance
You said there's no band, there's no radio
I got up real slow, started singing real low
When I was melting in your arms I had to let go

So let's re-enact that scene
From what's his name's one act play
I'll be your hero and you'll be the one

If there was no tomorrow
There were no yesterdays
The stolen moments we've borrowed
We wouldn't let slip away

So let's re-enact that scene
From what's his name's one act play
I'll be your hero

So let's re-enact that scene until our dying day
I'll be the hero and you can the one
Yeah, you could be the one that got away
