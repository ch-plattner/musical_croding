But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be 
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy 
But I lost my faith when I hit reality 
I don't need no Guru to tell me what to do 
When your feeling like a headline on 
Yesterday's news 

Come on, come on, come on 
Give me something for the pain 
Give me something for the blues 
Give me something for the pain when 
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose 
Give me something I can use 
To get me through the night 
Make me feel all right, 
Something like you 

Loneliness has found a home in me 
My suitcase and guitar are my only family 
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me 
I opened up my heart, but all I did was bleed 
I don't need no lover, just to get screwed 
They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise 

Come on, come on, come on 
Give me something for the pain 
Give me something for the blues 
Give me something for the pain when 
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose 
Give me something I can use 
To get me through the night 
Make me feel all right, 
Something like you 

Pull me under (Help I'm falling) 
Run through my veins (Night is calling) 
To a place (Feels like I'm flying) 
Where I feel no pain (Christ I'm dying) 
Be the pillow under my head 
Cover me when I'm in your bed 
Take me higher than I've ever been 
Take me down and back again 
Come to me, be my disguise 
Open your coat, let me crawl inside 
Come on, come on, come on 

Come on, come on, come on 
Give me something for the pain 
Give me something for the blues 
Give me something for the pain when 
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose 
Give me something I can use 
To get me through the night 
Make me feel all right, 
Something like you
