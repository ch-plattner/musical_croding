
When I was just a boy 
The devil took my hand 
Took me from my home 
He made me a man 
So, don't talk to me about sympathy now 
Cause you can't dance if you 
Take a chance on your rosary 

I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On the homebound train 

It's been a millions years 
That I been gone 
I been everywhere, now I'm heading home 
Been a lot of girls, but 
There's a woman I know 
Said don't take no plane 
Better take a train 
Cause I like it real slow 

All the way back home 
On the homebound train 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On the homebound train 

[Solo]

I'm on my way 
I'm heading home 
To be with my baby 
Where I belong 
Coming down the tracks now 
See, I done my time 
I'm going back now 
To that home of mine 
Well, here I come baby 

Here I come baby 
Here I come baby 

All the way back home 
On that homebound train 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On that homebound train
