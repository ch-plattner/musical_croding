
When it hurts just to talk, and it’s too dark to see
When my heart’s just a hole full of want, full of need
Stuck at a stoplight, hands gripping the wheel
Tears fill your eyes and you bleed just to feel
Someone beside you, someone to cry to

Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
To hear it back

Are you who you are
What’s under that mask
Do you burn for the future or yearn for the past
Did somebody send you, some broke fairy tale,
Now you wait by the water for a ship that has sailed

Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
Just to hear it back

When it hurts just to talk, and it’s too dark to see
You can touch, you can feel
Yeah, you just got to reach

Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
To hear it back
