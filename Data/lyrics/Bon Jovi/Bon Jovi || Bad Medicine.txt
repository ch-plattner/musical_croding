Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count 'em 1, 2, 3

First you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
And then you're on your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track
I got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
And then you're on your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Is what I need

[Solo]

I need a respirator 'cause I'm running out of breath
For you're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Your love—bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Who's bad, who's bad

I gotta do, I gotta
(Bad, bad medicine)
I gotta do, I gotta
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time with feel
Come on
One for that
Help me up now

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease

Your love—bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love—bad medicine
