Welcome to another hard night
You made it through another day
Sit at the counter counting tips
Can't count on nothing else these days
Don't want to go home to the T.V.
Don't want to go down to some bar
You grab a blanket,
Put the top down
And go driving in your car
Though your bed's as warm as January
On this cold December's night

Close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love

Welcome to another morning
The sun's still shining, but it's grey
Get out of bed now sleepy head
You'd give an arm to hear him say
Oh, and no one said that it'd be easy
But no one said it'd be this hard

To close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love
If there's an patron saint of blind love
I hope he keeps me on your mind, love
With every moment I'm away
We're getting closer to the day
We'll never have to say goodbye, love

These days it's hard for me
To feel the sand beneath my feet
With this gunny sack and boots on
Oh, but no one said this would be easy
And no one said it'd be this hard

Close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love
If there's an patron saint of blind love
I pray he keeps me on your mind, love
With every moment I'm away
We're getting closer to the day
We'll never have to say goodbye, love
With our blind love
Blind love

Welcome to another hard night
You made it through another day
