
I didn't want to say it in this way
I didn't want to see the day I'd say these words to you
I didn't want have to explain
Sometimes heroes have to lose
It's killing me to see you cry
Would it make it any better if I told you I did it all for you
It was just another roll of the dice
Just another star in the sky
Tried to touch it but I couldn't fly

[Chorus:]
Everybody knows the promise of the river
Everybody goes with the fire in their eyes
Everybody knows you can lead a horse to water
But there's nothing anybody can do
Rivers run dry

Gonna have to go away
I always told you that a man has got to face his own mistakes
Sometimes you get a lucky break
Sometimes your winning streak will stay
Sometimes you gotta pay

[Chorus:]
Everybody knows the promise of the river
Everybody goes with the fire in their eyes
Everybody knows you can lead a horse to water
But there's nothing anybody can do
When the rivers run dry

Oh, I remember when the rivers ran high
Oh, we could make it to the other side
Make it to the other side

[Chorus:]
Everybody knows the promise of the river
Everybody goes with the fire in their eyes
Everybody knows you can lead a horse to water
But there's nothing anybody can do
Oh, there's nothing anybody can do
There's nothing anybody can do
When the rivers run dry
