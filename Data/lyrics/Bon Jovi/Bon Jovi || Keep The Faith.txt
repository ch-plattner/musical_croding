
Mother mother tell your children 
That their time has just begun 
I have suffered for my anger 
There are wars that can't be won 

Father father please believe me 
I am laying down my guns 
I am broken like an arrow 
Forgive me 
Forgive your wayward son 

Everybody needs somebody to love 
(mother, mother) 
Everybody needs somebody to hate 
(please believe me) 
Everybody's bitching 
'cause they can't get enough 
And it's hard to hold on 
When there's no one to lean on 

Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain 
Lord you got to keep the faith 
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate 
Right now we got to 
Keep the faith 
Keep the faith 
Keep the faith 
Lord we got to keep the faith 

Tell me baby when I hurt you 
Do you keep it all inside 
Do you tell me al's forgiven 
And just hide behind your pride 

Everybody needs somebody to love 
(mother, father) 
Everybody needs somebody to hate 
(please don't leave me) 
Everybody's bleeding 
'cause the times are tough 
Well it's hard to be strong 
When there's no one to dream on 

Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain 
Lord you got to keep the faith 
Now you know is not too late 
Oh you got to keep the faith 
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate 
Right now we got to 
Keep the faith 
Keep the faith 
Keep the faith 
Lord we got to keep the faith 

Walking in the footsteps 
Of society's lies 
I don't like what I see no more 
Sometimes I wish that I was blind 
Sometimes I wait forever 

To stand out in the rain 
So no one sees me cryin' 
Trying to wash away the pain 
Mother father 

There's things I've done I can't erase 
Every night we fall from grace 

It's hard with the world in yours face 
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on 

Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain 
Lord you got to keep the faith 
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate 
Right now we got to keep the faith 
Faith: now it's not too late 
Try to hold on, trying to hold on 
Keep the faith
