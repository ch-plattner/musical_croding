
She wasn't young, but still a child 
There still was innocence 
In painted smiles 
She called to me as I passed her by 
Lady of the night looked in my eyes 
She said: I been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 

[Chorus:]
Without love, there's nothing without love 
Nothing else can get through the night 
Nothing else feels right without love 

I saw a man down on lonely street 
A broken man who looked like me 
And no one knows the pain that he's been living 
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven 
He said: I've been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 

[Chorus]

There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love 

I see my life 
There's some things I took for granted 
Love's passed me by 
So many second chances 
I was afraid 
But I won't be afraid no more 

[Chorus]

There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love
