
Ride cowboy ride. 
Through the back door to heaven. 
To the other side. 
I wanna know the danger of a kiss. 
At midnight. 
Ride, cowboy, ride. 
Yeah, I learn my lesson. 
Here's a story to tell
So I made my confession. 
In this sleazy motel. 
I could be the romantic
I could try my best lines
But ain't got the money
And we ain't got the time. 
Ride, cowboy, ride. 
Through the back door to heaven to the other side. 
I wanna know the danger of a kiss. 
At midnight. Ride cowboy ride. 
So you want to be a cowboy. 
Ride cowboy, ride. 
You want to be a big shot.
Baby, come on. 
Ride, ride, ride.
