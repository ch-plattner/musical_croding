It's hard to understand how old is old enough
Yeah, she was his girl, they met back in high school
And they ran off and got married 'cause they thought that it'd be cool

They'll never see what you are to me
All that I want, all that I believe is

They say we're too young to understand
They don't know how it feels when I hold your hand
They say we've gotta to prove what we're made of
You and me against the world
Outlaws of love

The honeymoon was over, the money'd all been spent
Felt like he was kidnapped, his ransom was the rent
Spent too much time crying, holding onto pride
He talks about a promise, he'd look her in the eye

No time to cry living on the run
We never know if our day will come

They say we're young and don't understand
They don't know how it feels when I hold your hand
We'll save our dreams before they turn to dust
They'll be no surrender for
Outlaws of love, outlaws of love, outlaws

You know it ain't easy to sink or rise above
These days you're two paychecks away, ain't that simple enough
Now I hope we can laugh when we look back on these years
We'd say about the hard times just sinking from our beer

They say we're young and don't understand
They don't' know how it feels when I hold your hand
Each day we gotta prove what we're made up
You and me against the world
Outlaws of love, outlaws of love
Outlaws of love, outlaws of love
