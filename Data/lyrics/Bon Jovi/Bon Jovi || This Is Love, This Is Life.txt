And my Cinderella feels like she stayed at the dance too long
We ain’t got much but what we got is all that matters
We’re pickin’ up the pieces, tryin’ to put ‘em back where they belong

Ohh, it’s gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we’re still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here’s paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life

These days it seems like there’s three sides to every story
There’s yours, mine, lately there’s the cold hard truth
Who cares who’s wrong or right when we turn out the lights?
We’ll find forgiveness when we’re in each other’s arms tonight
It ain’t pretty but somehow we always make it through

Ohh, it’s gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we’re still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here’s paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life

Ohh, it’s gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we’re still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here’s paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life
This is love, this is life
This is love, this is life
