
I couldn't sleep
Took a walk down Second Avenue

Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
One way street and I know where its leading to
There's a "For Sale" sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall

That's just one side of the story
In this two story town

[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down ,down, down, down
In a two story town

There's a girl that I sleep with
She's got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
And I kissed them both goodbye

Seven days of Monday morning
In a two story town

[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town

One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out

[Guitar solo ]

And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found

[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town

[Chorus 2:]
It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and drive out of this merry-go-round.
I won't give in and I won't back down
I'm going down, down, down, down down
Never going down, down, down, down, down
I ain't going down, down, down, down, down
In a two-story town
In this two story town
