
I've seen the heart of darkness
Let's just say I crossed over that line
Held hands with the hopeless
In too deep on that ride
Went around one more time
When you're standing on the edge
You don't look down
Till you're ready and willing to fly
Now I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing to try this time
I hitched a ride with forgiveness
In that river of emotion
I went down a third time
I spent the night with the living
Took a chance looked inside
Didn't know who I'd find
Standing on the corner of hello and goodbye
All alone it's there I made up my mind
I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing and to try 
I'm sick of giving up
With a little luck
I'm gonna get out of here
When you're standing on the edge
You don't look down
Till you're ready and willing to fly
Now I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing to try
I'm one step closer
I'm one step closer
