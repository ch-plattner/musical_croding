
Joey comes from a sacred part of town 
Where sometimes you talk so tough 
That your feet don't touch the ground 
And the sidewalk soldiers sing the midnite blues 
While the old men recite their story lines 
About when I was young like you 
They say: Oh yeah 
We were cruising to the backbeat 
Oh yeah, Making love in the backseats 
We were wild, wild in the streets 

A member of the boy's brigade 
Had a date with the girl next door 
You know it made her daddy crazy 
But it only made her want him more 
They weren't looking for trouble 
You know that boy didn't want a fight - not tonight 
So she headed out thru her bathroom window 
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright 
They said: Oh yeah 
We were cruising to the backbeat 
Oh yeah, Making love in the backseats 
We were wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 

Sometimes this town ain't pretty 
But you know it ain't so bad 
Just like a girl who looks so happy 
Whe inside she's so so sad 
In here we got this code of honor 
Nobody's going down 
You don't walk in vain 
Trough the kid's parade 
'Cause this is my hometown
