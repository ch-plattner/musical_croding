I tried to make you happy 
You know I tried so hard to be 
What you hoped that I would be 
I gave you what wanted 
God couldn't give you what you need 
You wanted more from me 
Than I could ever be 
You wanted heart and soul 
But you didn't know, baby 

Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart 

Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind 

You need someone to hold you 
Somebody to be there night and day 
Someone to kiss your fears away 
I just went on pretending 
Too weak, too proud, too tough to say 
I couldn't be the one 
To make your dreams come true 
That's why I had to run 
Though I needed you, baby 

Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart tonight 
That tears us apart 

Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind 

[Solo]

Maybe a better man 
Would live and die for you 
Baby, a better man would 
Never say goodbye to you 

Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart tonight 
That tears us apart 

Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind
