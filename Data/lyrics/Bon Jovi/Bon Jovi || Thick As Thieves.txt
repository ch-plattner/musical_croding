
In an empty room or a downtown bar
'Cross the universe, there's no place too far
Ya wherever you are, you and me
Thick as thieves

Well it ain't always pretty, sometimes it got rough
Could have thrown the towel in and thrown our hands up
Seems like we've always been and always will be
Thick as thieves

Time, time won't ever drag us down
You, me, us, ain't looking back or turning around
It's classic boy meets girl, with our backs against the world
You and me
Thick as thieves

In a world without faith, you're what I believe
When they're stacking the deck,
You're the card up my sleeve in my hour of need,
You and me, yeah
Thick as thieves

And that are all that's left behind us now
You, me, us, ain't looking back or turning around
It's classic boy meets girl, with our backs against the world
You and me
Thick as thieves

If I robbed a bank you wouldn't care
You'd come sit on my lap in the electric chair
And when they flipped the switch, huh, we'd just kiss

I know nothing's gonna stop us now
You, me, us, on the edge and never looking down
What's a boy to do, it's classic me and you
Lucky you, lucky me
Thick as thieves, oooh

Thick as thieves, woah, woah.
