
There's no-one watching over me tonight and I'm afraid to turn out the lights, 
If I close my eyes, it'll all go away and I don't wanna see it end this way. 

There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us 
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad 

Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard 
I'll keep my business, but I'm a little bit afraid 
Through the years one thing hasn't changed 

Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey 
I would run through fields of fire, 
I would crawl on broken glass, 
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance 
That's all I ask 

Now feeling good is not good enough, I know they've changed but not that much 
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, I never was one who needs to give enough 
I ain't a hero who gets the girl, but if I had my chance to save the world 
I won't blow it now, I guess I'll understand 
This boy becoming a man 

Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey 
I would run through fields of fire, 
I would crawl on broken glass, 
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance 
That's all I ask 

Well, look at your hands if you hear what I said. 
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends 
I know that I'm lucky, I know I'm right. 
Fingerst turn into fists, we're here to take on the night. 
That's right 

Now I'm staring at an open door, we've had a lot and I want much more 
You can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold 
If someone gives me back my soul 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hey 

I would run through fields of fire, 
I would crawl on broken glass 
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance 
I would run through fields of fire, 
I would run through fields of fire 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I would run 
All the way back home, I would run, 
Baby come along
