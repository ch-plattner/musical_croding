
Bless me father I have sinned, 
I'm not sure where to begin. 
I won't name names or where I've been, 
But I've been there and back again. 

No Hail Mary's will save me, 
You learned to live with memories, 
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve, 
Just stay inside until I leave. 

I've been running, always running 
Never have both feet on the floor. 
I've been running, always running, 
Now I'm not running any more... 

The hands of time may tick no more 
Let darkness fall upon this door 
No waves will wash up on this shore 
I won the fight but lost the war. 

I've been running, always running 
Never had both feet on the floor 
And I've been running, always running 
Now I ain't running anymore. 

There were roses I have loved 
Who've given or have given up 
I pushed your patience and my luck 
It wasn't love I didn't trust 
It wasn't you, or me, or us 
You've shouldered if's, and and's, and but's 
It's that way OK, I've said too much 
But I've been running, always running 
Never had both feet on the floor 
I've been running, always running 
Now I ain't running anymore.
