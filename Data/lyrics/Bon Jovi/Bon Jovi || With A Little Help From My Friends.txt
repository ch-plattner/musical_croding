
What would you do if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love - she's away
(does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(are you sad becaouse you're on your own

Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Baby I don't know
Baby I don't know

Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

Could you believe in the love at first sight
Yes, I'm certain it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn off the light
I can't tell you but I'm sure I feel nice

Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
Baby I don't know
Baby I don't know

Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
