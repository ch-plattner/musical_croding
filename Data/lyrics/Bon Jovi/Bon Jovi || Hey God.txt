Hey God, I'm just a little man got a wife and family 
But I almost lost the house 
Yeah, I bought into the dream 
We're barely holdin' on, when I'm in way to deep 
We're two paychecks away from living out on the streets 

She's a workin' single mom, like a Saint she doesn't complain 
She never says a word, but she thinks that she's to blame 
Her son just got convicted, he blew some punk away 
She did her best to raise him, but the world got in the way 

Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hanging on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 
Do you ever think about me 

Born into the ghetto in 1991, just a happy child 
Playing beneath the summer sun 
A vacant lots' his playground, by 12 he's got a gun 
The odds are bet against him, junior don't make 21 

Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hangin' on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 

I'd get down on my knees 
I'm going to try this thing you way 
Seen a dying man too proud to beg spit on his own grave 
Was he too gone to save? 
Did you even know his name? 
Are you the one to blame, I got something to say 

Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hangin' on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 
Do you ever think about me
