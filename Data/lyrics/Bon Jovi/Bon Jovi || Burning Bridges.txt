Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Lets call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell

Someone shut the lights off
Turn the page
The stories I could write
I've seen a million faces
And I've lived a couple lives
Here's our history for all to see
The smiles and all the scars
First the rising then the falling
Call this chapter shooting stars
That must sound good from where you are

Sayonara
Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Let's call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell

Check the box
Mark this day
There's nothing more to say
After 30 years of loyalty
They let you dig the grave
Now maybe you could learn to sing
Or even strum along
I'll give you half the publishing
You're why I wrote this song
Everybody sing along

Sayonara
Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Lets call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Hope my money and my masters
Buy a front row seat in hell
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play this for your friends in st. tropez
