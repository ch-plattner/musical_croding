
I come home from work, the beds aren't made
The honeymoon's over, bills aren't paid
What happened to us?
Did we bite off too much?
When a man loves a woman it's never enough

Nothing comes easy, with money and time
I run for the shelter of your arms tonight
We sit at our table at the end of the day
Like a couple of strangers with nothing to say

I know we're both too tough to cry
Well, I don't know the reason why

Love hurts
Hurts you inside, from the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts
The hurt goes away, hold on to your heart, we'll make it someday
Love hurts, love hurts

The weapons of love they'll sting and they'll burn you
She's got us beat, she won't play out your hand
'Till death do us part, to the end of the line
'Cause words at the altar still burn in my mind

I just can't stand to see you cry
No one knows the reasons why

Love hurts
Hurts you inside, from the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts
The hurt goes away, hold on to your heart, we'll make it someday
Love hurts, when it needs you
Love hurts, when it bleeds you
Love hurts, when it breaks you
Love hurts, whoa

[Solo]

At times I've been afraid to try
But sometimes it's alright to cry

Love hurts
Hurts you inside, from the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts
The hurt goes away, hold on to your heart, we'll make it someday
Love hurts
Hurts you inside, from the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts, love hurts...
