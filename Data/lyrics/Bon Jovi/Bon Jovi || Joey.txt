Joey Keys was from my neighborhood
Some would say that he was bad and Joe thought that was good
Joey got the name "Keys" picking locks
He never really robbed no one; it sure amused the cops
Joey's parents owned a restaurant
After closing time they'd give us almost anything we'd want
I never cared that Joey Keys was slow

Though he couldn't read or write too well but we'd talk all night long.

Come on, come on, come on
What you gonna do with your life?
Come on, come on, come on
Chasing sparks in the nights
His old man said tomorrow is a ride that goes nowhere
But I'll pull some strings, get blackbird wings
And break us out of here

[Chorus:]
Hey Joey
C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams
Tell me all the sights you're gonna see
Tell me who you're gonna be
Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
Sometimes you got to stand and fight
It'll be alright

We're gonna find a better life

See Joe was 3 years younger to the day
Acting like a little brother but became my ball and chain
I met this girl named Rhonda, she fell for me
She said, "I might learn to like him but love ain't built for three."

[Chorus]

Hey Joey
News gets around in this fading neighborhood
The old man lost the restaurant
He drinks more than he should
It's time for Joey keys to do some good
Pick the lock off our lives, let's get out of here like we always said we would

[Chorus]

We're gonna find a better life

Find a better life
Find a better life
