The clock strikes ten 
Out on the streets again 
I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when 
Out on the dark side of town 
Another rumble's gone down 
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about 

She's got something I want man, it's something I need 
It takes more than the night to satisfy me... 

[Chorus:]
I stand accused 
I can always run to you 
Any road that you choose 
I can always run to you 
I stand accused 
I can always run to you 
I run to you 
Baby, I can always run 

To a heart of chrome 
And a soul of steel 
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal 
And when I give her the gun 
You know she feels so right 
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight 

She's got something I want man, it's something I need 
It takes more than the night to satisfy me 

[Chorus]

And when the morning comes and I go to sleep 
When I close my eyes she's waiting for me 
I know that tonight she'll satisfy me 

[Chorus]
