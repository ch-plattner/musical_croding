Misery likes company, I like the way that sounds 
I've been trying to find the meaning, so I can write it down 
Staring out the window, it's such a long way down 
I'd like to jump, but I'm afraid to hit the ground 

I can't write a love song the way I feel today 
I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say 
Life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away 
I sing this song to you wherever you are 
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms 

I'm tired of watching TV, it makes me ant to scream 
Outside the world is burning, man it's so hard to belive 
Each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave 
I get so numb sometimes, that I can't feel the pain 

I can't write a love song the way I feel today 
I can't sing no song of hope I've got nothing to say 
Life is feeling kind of strange, it's strange enough these days 
I send this song to you, whoever you are 
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms 

Staring at the paper, I don't know what to write 
I'll have my last cigarette-well, turn out the lights 
Maybe tomorrow I'll fell a different way 
But here im my delusion , I don't know what to say 

I can't write a love song the way I feel today 
I can't sing no song of hope I've got nothing to save 
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains 
I send this song to you, whoever you are 
As my guitar lies bleeding
