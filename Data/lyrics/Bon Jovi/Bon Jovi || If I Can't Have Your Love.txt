
It's hard to remember a time
When I didn't have you, when I didn't have nothing
But a cold bed to come to at night
That was all I knew, until there was you

And then you took my world
And turned it all around
I couldn't live without you now

Baby, if I can't have your love
If I can't feel your touch, I got nothing
Baby, if I can't taste your kiss
Then I don't exist, I got nothing

No, I can't imagine living life without you
I can't imagine living life without your love

I wake up with you by my side
But I can't let go, I can't even bear
The thought of you in another man's eyes
I would lose control, I would die

'Cause now you're in my heart
And I can't let you out
I gotta keep you here somehow

Baby, if I can't have your love
If I can't feel your touch, I got nothing
Baby, if I can't taste your kiss
Then I don't exist, I got nothing

If I can't be your man
I wouldn't know who I am, I got nothing, I got nothing
No, I can't imagine living life without you
Can't imagine living life without your love

'Cause I can't imagine living life without you
Can't imagine living life without your love
Believe me, baby, I don't mean to doubt you
But if you ever leave, that would be the end of me, baby

Baby, if I can't feel your touch, I got nothing
Baby, if I can't taste your kiss
Then I don't exist, I got nothing, I got nothing

Baby, if I can't be your man
I wouldn't know who I am, I'd be nothing
Baby, if I can't have your love
If I can't feel your touch, I got nothing

No, I can't imagine living life without you
I can't imagine living life without your love
