Some 15 year old kid sits on his porch, just half-past noon 
Trying to figure out just what he's doing 
Why he had to grow up so soon 
With all the gangs, all the guns-watcha gonna learn in school 
There's got to be some way out of here 
He says "Man, this life is cruel" 

I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life 
She changed her name 
Her face because the grass looked greener on the other side 
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night 
Her friends, her family feel the pain, but she's the one who cries 

Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you need 
I want everything 

I've had enough of havin' nothing, I won't take just anything 
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything 
It's my life Mr. - I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string 
I want more than I see coming 
All I want is everything 
All I want is everything 

My next door neighbor Donnie 
Died in his room just the other day 
His brother come home 
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vain 
Cops come down with a body bag 
They said Donnie was a casually 
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out 
He couldn't handle reality 

Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you need 
I want everything 

I've had enough of havin' nothing, I won't take just anything 
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything 
It's my life Mr. - I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string 
I want more than I see coming 
All I want is everything 
All I want is everything
