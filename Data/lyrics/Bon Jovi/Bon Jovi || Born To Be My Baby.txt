
Rainy night and we worked all day 
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay 
We got something they can't take away 
Our love, our lives 

Close the door, leave the cold outside 
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side 
We got something that'll never die 
Our dreams, our pride 

My heart beats like a drum (all night) 
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright) 
And I'll never let go cause 
There's something I know deep inside 

You were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 

We got something to believe in 
Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 

Light a candle, blow the world away 
Table for two on a TV tray 
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK 
Our time, our way 

So hold me close better hang on tight 
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride 
We're two kids hitching down the road of life 
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (all night) 
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright) 
And I'll know that you'll be live 
In my heart till the day that I die 

Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 

We got something to believe in 
Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man
