When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire
A see through disguise cant conceal desire
I've been readin' your lips, they don't need no translation
They want more than a kiss, I come to make my donation

So turn out the lights, I'm going down slowly
Don't tell me what's right Just tell me you want me
Tell me you want me
Just tell me you want me, want me, want me

Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby

Come, come, come a little bit closer, I want to play doctor
It keeps getting harder, harder, harder to keep me away
I want to taste the sweat thats runnin' off of your body
Get the sheets all wet, I wanna make you feel naughty

Lets make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby

Turn out the lights
Don't tell me you love me
Just tell me you want me
Don't tell me you love me
Tell me you want me, want me, want me
Want me, want me, want me, want me

Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
