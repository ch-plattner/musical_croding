
Hello, is there anybody out there?
I'm alone hanging by a thread
Everywhere around the world
Everybody's waiting for someday
Calling out around the world
Maybe someday might be tonight

[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on

Are you there? 
Tell me what you're feeling.
Your fears and all your wildest dreams
Everyone around the world 
Is feeling just the same way that we are
Reaching out around the world
Will someone somewhere throw me a line?

[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on

Save me, save me
Save me, save me
Hello, is there anybody out there?

[Guitar Solo]

Calling out around the world
Maybe someday might be tonite

[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on
Hook me up
I'm hanging on the line, come on
Hook me up
Make me come alive, come on, take me on

Save me, save me,
Save me, save me
