Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down 
He's gonna pay the rent 
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get 
It feels like there's a stranger standing in these shoes 
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you 

I know I promised baby 
I would be the one to make our dreams come true 
I ain't too proud of all the struggles 
And the hard times we've been through 
When this cold world comes between us 
Please tell me you'll be brave 
'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away 

If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me 

Pour another cup of coffee 
Babe I got something to say to you 
I ain't got the winning ticket 
Not the one that's gonna pull us through 
No one said that it'd be easy 
Let your old man take you home 
But know that if you walk out on me that darling 
I'd be gone 

If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 

It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride 
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes 
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone 
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on 

If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us 
If that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 
C'mon lie to me
