
We are rolling, good

Little Jimmy just bought high top sneakers
Wants to fly high like his heroes can
He’s got the smile like Michael Jordan
In the schoolyard, Jimmy, he’s the man

I’m sitting here watching his heart beating
He’s ten feet tall, all five feet four of him
Come six o’clock working out his foul shot
Who we fooling, Mama’s calling, she smiles and says

You and me, we’re ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

She lives alone, got four kids through high school
She cleans houses and she takes in wash at night
You’d never know that she don’t have much
Because she’s rich with the things money can’t buy

She don’t need clothes, she don’t want diamonds
Don’t need a brand new car to drive in
What she’s got is love and that’s a lot
At least it’s a good start

You and me, we’re ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be someone
We only want to watch the game on Sunday
Sit back, catch a little buzz

Ain’t nobody wants to be nobody
Everybody wants a little love
Everybody wants to be the hero
And ride into the setting sun

You and me, we’re ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

And I’ve got dreams like ordinary people
I can see them when I close my eyes at night
Can’t you see we’re ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
