
You call every hour, but there's nothing to say
So talk to me now, before it's too late
Oh they say it couldn't happen, but I saw your picture breathe
That fifty dollar doctor said your love is a disease

I'm alright, I'm okay
Still I don't know how, and I don't know why
But the talk turns to shop, and so we stand on the edge of goodbye
Is this the end of the beginning, or beginning of an end
Are you friend or the enemy, or enemy or the friend

I walk the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline

I hear talk on the streets, I hear rumors of you
The people I meet say, that the lies are all true
And I wake up in a cold sweat, find you lying fast asleep
Is my dream a reality, reality a dream

I've crossed the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline

I walk the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline
Yeah, yeah, yeah
