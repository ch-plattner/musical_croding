
I have run from the truth
Since the days of my misspent youth
I was hungry for kindness
I was lost in life's blindness
When you're born without wings
All you dream of all you want
Is that feeling of flying?
Of rising and climbing

Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day

You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You've got to learn to love
The world you're living in

Always thought I'd die young
In these hands I held the gun
But it's too late for dying
Now there's nothing worth hiding
I've lost love lived with shame
I was humbled by my fall from grace
On the steps of decision
It's revenge or forgiveness

Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day

You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You got to learn to love
The world you're living in

Halle Halle
Halle Halle

Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day
You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You got to learn to love
The world you're living in

Halle Halle
And that's how it is
You've got to learn to love
The world you're living in

Halle Halle
Halle Halle
Halle Halle
