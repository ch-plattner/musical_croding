
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

Dateline early sunday morning
Shots ring out without a warning
No one seems to even blink in this town
Two dead and a baby missing
Sirens screaming in the distance
A mother pleading bring my baby home now

For the pink slip of an suv
A night cut down with tragedy
His defense another generation breakdown

Yeah, Yeah

What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listning
Or have you just given up

Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Corporate countries go to war
Behind the lies they're fighting for
And black gold from an old king's soul won his round
How can someone take a life
In the name of god and say it's right
How does money lead to greed
When there's still hungry mouths to feed

Yeah, Yeah 

What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listning
Or have you just given up

We need forgiveness
We all need a lot of love....

We need some hope
We need it now
A little faith man help me out
I'll learn to pray
But it's too late now

Yeah, Yeah

What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listening
Or have you just given up

What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
We need forgivness
We all need a lot of love...
A lot of love...
