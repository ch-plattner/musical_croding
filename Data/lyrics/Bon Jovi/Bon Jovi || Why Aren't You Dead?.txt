
I got the letter you left under my door
It knocked me on my ass to the floor
Never knew two words could take such a bite
It said, "Dear Jon, hello, goodbye"

I saw your car parked outside Motel Cascade
Saw two shadows go to town on the shade
I can't believe my own lyin' eyes, oh my
It better be your girlfriend I saw goin' down some other guy

You told me you loved me, 'til death do us part
So tell me there's a tombstone where there used to be a heart

You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?
Instead of six feet under you're in someone else's bed
There's just one thing that I can't get through my head
You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?

I cut your face out of our old photographs
And all the junk you left behind's in the trash
Well, I thought you were a goner for sure
Well, there's been a resurrection, yeah, a miracle cure

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If you can't trust the livin' baby who can you trust?

You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?
Instead of six feet under you're in someone else's bed
Just one thing that I can't get through my head
You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If you can't trust the livin', baby who can you trust?

Couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?
Instead of six feet under you're in someone else's bed
There's just one thing that I can't get through my head
You said you couldn't live without me baby, so why aren't you dead?

You said you couldn't live with out me, what a surprise
Instead of layin' you out I'm layin' down on the line
You spend my hard-earned money, you left me in the red
You said you couldn't live without me so why aren't you dead?
So why aren't you dead? Why aren't you dead?
