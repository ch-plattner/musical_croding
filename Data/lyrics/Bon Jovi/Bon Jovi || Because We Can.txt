
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

She's in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black and white
Right now she's missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights

Lately he's feeling like a broken promise
In the mirror staring down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV and takeout on the coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment everything is alright

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can
Because we can
