Every day of my life has been
Leading me here tonight
Feels like I'm coming home
Back to you, back to you

Every chance that I take
Every wrong turn and every mistake
Is a step on the road
Back to you and I'm alive

I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah I get a rush

And my goal, I see you
You're as close as the hole in my shoe
And when I'm feeling used
I'm renewed, I get high

I can fly, I've got wings
I've got riches that money can't bring
I've got more than a king, I've got you
And baby that's alright

I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, I get a rush from you

Everything you do, I call it love
Yeah, I get a rush, I get a rush, yeah

Every day of my life
Has been leading me here tonight
And wherever I roam I'm heading
Back home to you, back to you

'Cause I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah I get a rush

I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know I like, I get a rush from you

Everything you do, I call it love
Yeah, I get a rush, I get a rush from you
