
I always knew, that I'd like this place
You don't have to look too far, to find a friendly face
I feel alive when I'm walkin' on the street
I feel the heart of the city poundin' underneath my feet

[CHORUS]
Yeah let the world keep spinning round 'n' round
This is where it's goin' down, down, down
That's why I, love this town
That's why I, keep co-min' round

Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
You make me feel at home some how, right, now
That's why I, love this town

I've got some good friends here, I might have broke a heart or two
It's gettin' loud over there, they boys must have had a few
And hey the cop on the corner, he knows everybody's name
And a kid with a dream singin' for some spare loose change

[CHORUS]
Yeah let the world keep spinning round 'n' round
This is where it's goin' down, down, down
That's why I, love this town
That's why I, keep co-min' round

Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
You make me feel at home some how, right, now

That's why I, love this town

[GUITAR SOLO]

There's shoutin' from the rooftops
Dancin' on the bars
Hangin' out the window
Drivin' in their famous cars
You want it? You got it
You ready? I'm on it
Come on now, here we go again....

That's why I, love this town
That's why I, love this town

No matter where you're from, tonight you're from right here
This is where it all goes down, down, down
That's why I, love this town

[REPEAT x3]
Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
I love this town
[END REPEAT]

Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
I loove this town

[GUITAR SOLO - END OF SONG]
