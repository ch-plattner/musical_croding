
In the heat of the street of the city 
A young boy hides the pain 
And he walks so tall, trying to hang on 
But he knows he's going down again 
I know he's going down... 

Darkness fades he's the prince of his city 
In a place where they all know your name 
You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed. 
Your just a pawn in a losin' game 
You lose at life it ain't no game 

[Chorus:]
Hear their cries 
The hardest part is the night 
(In the night, hear their cries, in the night) 
Stay alive 
The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night... 

All alone in a place where the lonely 
They all have to walk through the rain 
And they dance on the edge where you only 
Only pray that it has to end 
That the night ain't no friend 

[Chorus]

These four walls they could tell you some stories 
About lying and dying and fame 
There's a price that you pay for the glory 
About losing and choosing and pain. 

[Chorus]
