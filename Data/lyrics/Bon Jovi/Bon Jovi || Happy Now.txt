
What would you say to me
If I told you I had a dream
If I told you everything
Would you tell me to go back to sleep
Take a look in these tired eyes
They're coming back to life
I know I can change
Got hope in my veins
I'm telling you I ain't going back to the pain

Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
Let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turnin my world around

Can I be happy now
Can I break free somehow
I just want to live again
Love again
Pick my pride up off of the ground
I'm ready to pick a fight
Crawl out of the dark to shine a light
I ain't throwing stones
Got sins of my own
Ain't everbody just trying to find a way home

Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around

You're born then you die
it's all gone in a minute
I ain't looking back
Cause I don't want to miss it
You better live now
Cause no one's going to get out alive, alive

Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now
Ohhhh
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now
