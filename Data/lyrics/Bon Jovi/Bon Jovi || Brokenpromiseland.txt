
Angels falling from the sky
Imagine that imaine that
Nobody getting out of here alive
No turning back no turning back
Who's going to bail out all our shattered dreams
And scrape some truth off of these city streets
No time for praying get up off your knees

There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland

Let's close our eyes and just disappear
Slip through the cracks no looking back
We'll get a million miles away from here
And let the past just fade to black
So what you learn to live with your regrets
No need to fear what hasn't happened yet
Life will get you but you can't forget

There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland

So rise my fallen angel
Come on now come on now
Shine, don't let them break you
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on now

Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on

There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland

La la la la la la la la... breaking out of brokenpromiseland
La la la la la la la la... breaking out of brokenpromiseland
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
