
Take a look around you, yeah, the sky is falling
Sinners say your prayers this train is off the tracks
Nothing is forever when tomorrow's calling
Dancing with the devil to get one day back

I'm not afraid of burning bridges
'Cause I know they're gonna light my way
Like a Phoenix, from the ashes
Welcome to the future it's a new day

We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountains
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run

Take me to the banks of your muddy water
Where the flesh and blood and the spirit meet
Only takes your touch for me to find salvation
You're the only reason that I still believe

I'm not afraid of burning bridges
'Cause I know they're gonna light my way
Like a Phoenix, from the ashes 
Welcome to the future it's a new day

We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountain
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run

We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountain
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run
