
You take and you take without giving
Like the ride is never going to end
You think you know who's going to heaven
Well I know I'm going to see you again
On Judgment Day

Others, they walk the bad road
If you do you better watch what you say
You think that you can hide in your shadow
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way

On Judgement Day
You walk through the fire
Nowhere to run and no one to blame
'Cause, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgement Day

Some people they call me brother
Some people they say that they care
Some people they steal from the heavens above
It's gonna be a cross to bear

On Judgement Day
You walk through the fire
With nowhere to run and no one to blame
Well, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgement Day
Hey, hey, hey

[Solo]

It's just me and you
I don't wanna fade away
Let's face up to the truth
It's our own Judgement Day

On Judgement Day
You walk through the fire
Nowhere to run and no one to blame
Well, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgement Day
On Judgement Day
On Judgement Day
On Judgement Day
