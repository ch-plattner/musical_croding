
There's a whole lotta lonely
waiting out there
There's a whole lotta people 
that'll lead you nowhere
So be safe my lover
let me offer my prayer
There's a whole lotta lonely
waiting out there

There's a whole lot of kisses
waiting out there
and the world you been missing 
that don't play fair
Let me offer you comfort
and show you how much I care
There's a whole lot of lonely waiting,
waiting out there

When love is blind sometimes the lies can get you through the night
I'm holding on to what I need till you're too tired to fight

Now there's a lot of lone riders
so baby beware 
After the warmth of his whisper
in the cool night air
It'll be hard to wake up to
that handsome cold blank stare
Cause there's a hell of a lot of lonely waiting out there

When love is blind sometimes the lies can get you through the night
I'm holding on to what I need till you're too tired to fight

Now there's a whole lotta lonely
waiting out there
There's a whole lotta people 
that'll lead you nowhere
There's only so much sorrow 
that a heart can bare
There's a hell of a lot of lonely waiting out there
There's a hell of a lot of lonely
Baby I'm scared
Waiting out there
