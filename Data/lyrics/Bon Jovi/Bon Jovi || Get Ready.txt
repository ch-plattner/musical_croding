You need someone to make it last 
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast 
They fade away 
Tonight you're not gonna be alone 
Making love on the telephone 
Baby, baby if you can hold on 
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight 
I like 'em down and dirty, so hold on tight 

[Chorus:]
Come on get ready 
Come on get ready 

You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes 
You got the style and you got the moves 
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose 
You're caught up in a danger zone 
Just seventeen but you act full grown 
The night life, baby, is turning you on 
You want to take me all the way tonight 
Take my hand, you can feel the heat 
Make you feel alright 

[Chorus]

Come on 
Come on
