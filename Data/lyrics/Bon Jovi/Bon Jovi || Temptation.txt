
Place my missing picture on my beer
I’m running away from home
Sam I’m just a man
A rusted bucket of flesh and bones
Someday I’ll seek forgiveness
For the sweet smell of her breath
She touched my hand and asked for a check
I put out my cigarette

Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I’m walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I’m on my way
I'm gonna hang my head down tonight
On Damocles sword

When the angels hung out in Eden
They caught Adam chasing Eve
They said grab your boots, your coat, your hat
My boy, it’s time that you leave
She asked me if I'd liked to play
'Cause she knew that I was broke
I cashed my chips out months ago
This smile is just mirrors and smoke

Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I’m walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I’m on my way
I'm gonna hang my head down tonight
On Damocles sword

Twist my wrist
Tell me I should resist
But the flesh is weak
Here comes the kiss

Twist my wrist
I can’t go on like this
Ah the flesh is weak
Here it comes, here it comes

Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I’m walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I’m on my way
I'm gonna lay my head down tonight
On Damocles sword, temptation

I'm gonna lay my head down tonight
On Damocles sword
