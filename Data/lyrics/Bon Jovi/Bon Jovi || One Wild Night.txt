It's a hot night, the natives are restless 
We're sweating by the light of the moon 
There's a voodoo mojo brewing at the go-go 
That could knock a witch off her broom 

We slither on in and shed our skin 
Make our way into the bump and the grind 
So I'm passing by, she gives me the eye 
So I stop to give her a light 

[Chorus:] 
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night 

Havin' as much fun as you can in your clothes 
Margarita had me feelin' alright 
It just might be that I found religion 
I've been on my knees for half of the night 
Then I'm rolling the bones with Jimmy 'no dice' 
Gonna take him for a couple weeks' pay 
Man, if you lose this roll I take your girlfriend home 
So I stopped 
But you're not gonna believe who comes walking out 

[Chorus:]
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild night (hey, c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life is for the living so 
You gotta live it up, come on let's go) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night 

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus:]
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild night (hey, c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life if for the living so 
You gotta live it up, come on let's go) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one.. 

One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone) 
For one wild night 
One wild night (hey,c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life is for the living) 
All we've got is one wild night 

One wild night [4x]
One wild night blinded by the moonlight 
One wild night 24 hours of midnight 
One wild night stepped into the twilight zone for
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night.
