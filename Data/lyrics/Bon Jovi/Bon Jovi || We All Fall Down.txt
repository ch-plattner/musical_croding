
Don't be afraid to lose your way
Take that step don't hesitate
Your time is now

Don't be afraid to scrape your knees
On these streets of shattered dreams
Stand up and be proud
I'm telling you now

Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall down

Down on your luck you're feeling small
The little things seem 10 feet tall
Watch your dreams fall apart at the seams

You want to scream and shout out loud
When you sit up they knock you down
You're a long way from home
But you're never alone, yeah

Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall

We're all digging in this dirt
We're all living hand to mouth
We're all trying to fit in
Trying not to chicken out

Life doesn't wait, don't hesitate
Don't lose your faith it's judgement day
They're calling you out
I'm calling you now

Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall down
'Cause we all fall down
'Cause we all fall down
