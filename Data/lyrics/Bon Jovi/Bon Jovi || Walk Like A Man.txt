
He said sit down son, we've gotta talk 
I said "it's my life, I'm gonna do what I want 
I'm not gonna crawl, I'm gonna walk 
Walk right out that door" 

He said "I used to be a lot like you 
There's nothing you've done that I didn't do" 
I left and said "Dad I'm bulletproof 
We've been through this before" 

I couldn't believe it 
There was a tear in my old man's eye 
When I was leaving 
He tried to say goodbye 

He said stand tall when you stumble 
Stay pround when you're humbled 
The lessons you learn 
Won't be the ones that you plan 

And every step up that mountain 
Will be more than worth countin' 
And when you walk through the valley 
May you walk like a man 

And now I've seen a couple miles on a gravel road 
Been taught a couple things that I didn't know 
And yeah, I've even got a kid of my own 
Starting to sound a lot like me 

I learned a little thing called sacrifice 
Givin' up on dreams, lost a couple fights 
All anybody wants is a better life 
And something to believe 

Stand tall when you stumble 
Stay pround when you're humbled 
All the lessons you learn 
Won't be the ones that you plan 

Every step up that mountain 
Will be more that worth countin' 
When you walk through the valley 
May you walk like a man 

I couldn't believe it 
When the tears came to my eyes 
It isn't easy 
Standing on the other side 

I said "Sit down son we gotta talk 
Hey it's your life, you're gonna do what you want 
I won't say crawl before you walk" 
Cause I heard my old man in my mind sayin' 

Stand tall when you stumble 
Stay pround when you're humbled 
All the lessons you learn 
Won't be the ones that you plan 

And every step up that mountain 
Will be more that worth countin' 
And when you walk through the valley 
May you walk like a man 

And when you go on without me 
Walk, like a man 

Walk on
