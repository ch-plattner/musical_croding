
At the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on
You're insecure about what clothes to wear
I can't see nothing wrong

To me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind
It's half past eight, it's getting late
It's OK, take your time

Standing here my hands in my pockets
Like I have a thousand times
Thinking back it took one breath
One word to change my life

[Chorus:]
The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone
Everybody tries to kidnap your attention
You just smile and steal the show

You come to me and take my hand
We start dancin' slow
You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low

[Chorus:]
From the first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

And when you're laying down beside me
I feel your heartbeat to remind me...

[Chorus:]
The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

From hello
From hello
