I was lost, then I found you 
Never thought it would be this way 
I showed you my heart,  left it unguarded 
Like a thief in the night you stole it away 

Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on 
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night 

[Chorus:]
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines 
You're running on into a cold night 
You're just a number of the love lies 

All alone you call it survival 
He lost at love to a stranger's lines 
Walking the streets, searching with vengeance 
For a face that he dreams of night after night 

Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken 
Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive 

[Chorus]

They met late one night in the city 
Both men knew only one would stay 
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet 
And took his life away 

[Chorus]
