Bet the black comes in red, crimes of passion rule my head 
I need you, you want him, dressed to kill we live in sin 

I know the game you play, I know it well 
You just keep on playin' when all the bets are down 

[Chorus:]
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin, 
Caught up in a game you just can't win 
Roulette, you're just a fantasy 
It's everything that you want it to be 

Play the numbers one by one, fire the shot and the damage is done 
Restless lovers pay the price, cheating hearts don't think twice 

When you make the rules no one can slow you down 
You just keep 'em waiting when you're on the prowl 

[Repeat chorus x 2]

Backdoor runner got away this time 
Leaves her mark at the scene of the crime 
Nothing matters, no faces, no names 
You're just a number, it's all the same 
You just love to play the game 

I know the game you play, I know it well 
You just keep on playin' when all the bets are down 

[Repeat chorus x 2]
