
There's a room at the end of the world
Where my secrets go to hide
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I'll wait for you tonight

Where the roads all go to end
Where lost Valentines get sent
Where a rose comes back to life
Where young love never dies
Where we never say goodbye

Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world

There's a room at the end of the world
Where your memories are safe
There's a room at the end of the world
Just gotta have some faith

Where all prayers go to be heard and the truth will have its turn
Take a look into these eyes, there's no place I'd rather be tonight
No place I'd rather be tonight

Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world

There's no looking back in our room
Fade to black

There's a room at the end of the world
That I hang on to
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I wait for you,
I'll wait for you

Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world

Where I wait for you in our room
Dreams are coming true in our room
It's just me and you in our room.
