You wanna start a fire
It only takes a spark
You gotta get behind the wheel
If you're ever gonna drive that car

If you wanna take a bite
You'd better have the teeth
If you're gonna take that step
Then get up off of your knees

'Cause tonight we're alive

Who'll stand for the restless and the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?

You wanna start a fight
You gotta take a swing.
You gotta get your hands in the dirt
To see what the harvest will bring.

You wanna raise your voice
Don't be scared to breathe
Don't be afraid to hurt
Don't be ashamed in need

'Cause tonight we're alive

Who'll stand for the restless and the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?

The leaves fall like reasons that drift through the seasons
'Til dreams are just fade dark and grey.
And all of your plans that slip right through your hands
Are just things that you take to your grave.

Tonight we're alive.

Who'll stand for the restless, for the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
