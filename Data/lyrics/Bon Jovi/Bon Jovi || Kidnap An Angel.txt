I get up every morning, drink coffee alone
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home
I let the newspapers pile up at the door
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring
I can't make much sense out of anything

If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings
And bring them to you that would fix everything

I get in the car like I do every day
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here

If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings
And bring them to you that would fix everything
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die
If I could kidnap an angel

Now the parking attendant knows my first name
These long green hallways all look the same
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor
I brace myself when I get to the door
I close my eyes and take a deep breath
Then sit down beside your hospital bed

If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings
And bring them to you that would fix everything
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel

He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls
People laughing like children through these hospital halls
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel
