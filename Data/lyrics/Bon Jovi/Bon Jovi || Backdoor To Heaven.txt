
And now we're alone
My heart's in your hands
I need someone to love
Like any other man

I feel your innocence, baby
Someone's guilty tonight
I need someone to save me
To keep me warm 'cause it's cold outside

Won't you help me, baby, don't you hide now
Won't you take me, darling, for a ride now
You got me begging and I'm on my knees
You gotta let me in, let me in, let me in

The backdoor to heaven is your arms tonight
You're my backdoor to heaven
So, baby, let me in, let me in, let me in

You make it so hard
To open your door
I know you're an angel
You just never ever flown before

I'm in the dark, won't you give me some light now
No one can tell us, baby, what's wrong or right now
You've got me begging on my, on my knees
Oh, won't you let me in, let me in

The backdoor to heaven is your arms tonight
You're my backdoor to heaven
So, baby, let me in, let me in, let me in

Oh, I'm just a sinner but this ain't no sin
So, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in

The backdoor to heaven is in your arms tonight
You're my backdoor to heaven
You gotta let me, let me in, let me in
The backdoor to heaven
Halfway to paradise
You're my backdoor to heaven
Oh, baby, let me in, yeah

In your heart, your soul, your kiss
Your mind, my soul, my everything
My kiss, your lips...
