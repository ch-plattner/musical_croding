Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 

I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 

[Chrous:]
I'm the King of the Mountain 
I'm the King of the Hill 
I'm the King of the Mountain 
I'm the King of the Hill 

You spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time 
Boss man says "Hey boy, you'll never be no good" 
With the night there's a magic in the air that makes us come alive 
Tonight's the night they can't put you down, no one could 

I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 

[Chorus]

Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out. 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls. 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 

I been down and mistreated 
We won't be cheated 
Now we're standing undefeated... 

[Chorus]
