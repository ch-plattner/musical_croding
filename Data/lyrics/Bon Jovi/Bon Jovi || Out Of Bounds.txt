
A loaded gun needs no alibis
Out on the street where the truth's a lie
Wasted blood that I left behind
Broken hearts leave a young man blind

I need protection on the underground
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

Out of bounds
You can cross that line
Out of bounds
Is out of time

Out of bounds
Is where I'll be
I can't hold on but I can't break free
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

Out of bounds
Out of bounds

You're asking why but who's to say
The things you've known haven't gone away
Nowhere to run, no one to blame
I'm just a puppet in a bad man's game

I need protection on the underground
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

Out of bounds
You can cross that line
Out of bounds
Is out of time

Out of bounds
Is where I'll be
I can't hold on but I can't break free
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

Out of bounds
Out of bounds

So say a prayer for the innocent
It's the innocent who believe
You can't forgive what you can't forget
When that innocent man was me

Out of bounds
You can cross that line
Out of bounds
Is out of time

Out of bounds
Is where I'll be
I can't hold on but I can't break free
I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down down

Out of bounds
Out of bounds
Out of bounds
