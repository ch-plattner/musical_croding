
I'm here trying to make a living
I ain't living just to die
Never getting back what I'm giving
Can someone somewhere help me justify
Why these strong hands are on the un-employment line

Now there's nothing left
But what's on my mind
oh ohh oh ohh

Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man

Empty pockets full of worry
Had to get two jobs
And it was hard enough just getting by
With the grace of god I'll get us through
I only know what I know how to do
I'm the only one who's got to look my family in the eye

Day after day
Night after night
Oh Ohh Oh Ohh

Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man, working man, working man

I lost my pension
They took my I.D
These were my friends
These were my dreams
These were my hopes
These are my streets
Can you hear me?

Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man, working man, working man

These were my friens
These were my dreams
These were my hopes
These are my... streets
