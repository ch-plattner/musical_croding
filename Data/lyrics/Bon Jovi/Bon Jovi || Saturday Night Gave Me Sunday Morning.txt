
I was living my life like a long-lost weekend
Never felt nothing, jumping right into the deep end
I wasn't missing nothing, that was ever worth getting
Never hung around enough to regret it

You came walking in late but just in time
You ended my excuses with a ten cent rhyme
Your shoes and attitude were stacked way up high
I knew right then you were the story of my life

Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

When you're driving down a street that's only going one way
When every day starts feeling like a month of Mondays
You should know I still got something left to prove
I know what it takes to get back to you

Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

Remember those nights staring out at the lights
Making time with our feet in the sand
Making up words to our favorite songs
Laughing loud with those drinks in our hands
And as that boy put his head on her shoulder
She pulled him tight to get a bit closer
And as the world just disappeared
You whispered in my ear

Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

Sunday mornings
