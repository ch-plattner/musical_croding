We're growing up the hard way

She's got a blue tattoo on the back of her hand
It says "I love you" from the boys in the band
She's been living on the run for almost a year
Her daddy would abuse her, she's been living in fear

She's got a diamond in her teeth and a leather beret
She knows every city street from New York to L.A.
She's got little girl eyes
And her heart's made of stone
I guess you gotta grow up fast
When you're out on your own

Try to hold your head up high
You live and then you die
Can someone tell me why

Growing up the hard way
Learning how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growing up the hard way
It;s getting harder every day
Lying in a bead made of fire
Praying to God for some rain
Growing up the hard way

He was the pride and joy of the family
He always was the good boy they told him to be
But no one knew the anger that was building up inside
He was drinking from the bottle
That his old man used to hide
He stole this rent-a-car off of Route 35
And when he gunned it I heard him scream
"Straight to hell I'm gonna drive"
Then the cops came out of nowhere
And that truck got in his way,
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, that it had to end this way

Try to hold your head up high
You live and then you die
Can someone tell me why

Growing up the hard way
Learning how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growing up the hard way
It;s getting harder every day
Lying in a bead made of fire
Praying to God for some rain

Growing up the hard way, growing up the hard way
Growing up the hard way, growing up the hard way

Try to hold your head up high
You live and then you die
Can someone tell me why

Growing up the hard way
Learning how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growing up the hard way
It;s getting harder every day
Lying in a bead made of fire
Praying to God for some rain

Growing up the hard way, growing up the hard way
I'm growing up the hard way
Growing up the hard way
We'll suffer the hard way, baby
Growing up the hard way, growing up the hard way
