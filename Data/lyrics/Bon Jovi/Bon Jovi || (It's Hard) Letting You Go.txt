It ain't no fun lying down to sleep 
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep 
I wish the stars up in the sky 
Would all just call in sick 
And the clouds would take the moon out 
On some one-way trip 

I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend 
But somehow they drove me back here once again 
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul 
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home 
It would all have been so easy 
If you'd only made me cry 
And told me how you're leaving me 
To some organ grinder's lullaby 

It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart 
It's hard letting you go 

Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue 
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to 
Well - me, these days 
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane 
Unless you're coming back for me 
That's one thing I know that won't change 

It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart 
It's hard letting you go 

Now some tarot card shark said I'll draw you a heart 
And we'll find you somebody else new 
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips 
When I bet all that I had on you 

It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard 
It's hard letting you go 
It's hard, so hard, it's tearing out my heart 
But it's hard letting you go
