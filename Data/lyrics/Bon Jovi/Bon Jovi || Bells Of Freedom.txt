
I have walked all alone
On these streets, I call home
Streets of hope, streets of fear
Through the sidewalk cracks
Time dissapears
I was lost, on my knees
On the eve of defeat
As i choked back the tears
There's a silent scream no-one could hear

So far away from everything, you know it's true
Something inside that makes you know what you've got to do

[Chorus]
Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the bells of freedom
When your world's crashing down like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the bells of freedom

Up the steps of the church
Through the fields in the dirt
In the dark I have seen
That the sun still shines for the one who believed

So far away, so full of doubt, you needed proof
Just close your eyes, and hear the sound inside of you

[Chorus x3]
