
Regrets are all you left, on your lipstick stains
Take a picture of our past there in that ashtray
We had our fun, I used to light your flame
Like the dancing smoke that rose we tried to find our way

No one told me, she told me

Your love's like one last cigarette
Last cigarette, I will savor it
The last cigarette
Take it in and hold your breath, hope it never ends
But when it's gone, it's gone
The last cigarette

Just to breathe reminds me of what used to be
The smoke's the ghost that keeps you close when I can't sleep
Don't ask the past to last, it's about to change
The memories don't answer when I call your name

No one told me, she told me

[Chorus]
Your love's like one last cigarette
Last cigarette, I will savor it
The last cigarette
Take it in and hold your breath, hope it never ends
But when it's gone, it's gone
One last cigarette, last cigarette
One I can't forget, the last cigarette
Right there at my fingertips, got your taste still on my lips
Right or wrong
You're still gone, gone, gone

No one told me, she told me
You always lose the girl in a Brian Wilson world

[Chorus]

No one told me, she told me
The Last Cigarette
