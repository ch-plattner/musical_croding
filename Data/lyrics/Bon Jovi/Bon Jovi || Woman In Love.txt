
Call it social commentary 
Call it just what me eyes see 
Seems that there's more pretty women 
Than there are fish in the sea 
...Woman in love 

You see there's girls who like your money 
Girls who like your car 
Girls who like to sip champagne 
And feed on caviar 
...Woman in love 

Send me some silk stockings 
Smooth talking lipstick and curls 
I want a woman 
More than a girl 
Need some lip-locking, cool walking 
Diamonds and pearls 
I'll wrap 'em all up 
And give them the world 

You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing 
She can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 

If lust is just a dirty dog 
I've been scratching with the fleas 
I've been waking up your neighbours 
Barking up your tree 
I went down to the shopping mall 
To get it off my mind 
But it's like sleeping with the enemy 
If you're not deaf and blind 

I tried to run 
But it was too late for me 
I tried to hide 
Since the day Adam met Eve 
Till I turned on the television 
And I looked up on the screen 
I saw a hundred pretty girls 
Sing this song on MTV 

Sen me some silk stockings 
Smooth talking lipstick and curls 
I want a woman 
More than a girl 
Need some lip-locking, cool walking 
Diamonds and pearls 
I'll wrap 'em all up 
And give them the world 

You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing she can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
There ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
There ain't secret 
To woman in love 
You think that you can 
Live without 'em 
But you're asking too much 
You see I've slept with romance 
And danced with lust 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Oh, yeah 

I've traveled all around the world 
Across the seven seas 
Got everything I wanted 
There's just one thing I need 
It hasn't changed forever 
Fathers tell your sons 
That there ain't nothing like 
A thing called love 

You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing she can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
There ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
There ain't secret 
To woman in love 
You think that you can 
Live without 'em 
But you're asking too much 
You see I've slept with romance 
And danced with lust 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Oh, yeah
