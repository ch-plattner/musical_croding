Well, it's closing time, I've got no place to go
No, I'm not tired, nobody's waiting at home
Hey, what about you? Looks like you're leaving alone
Guess that makes two, me and you

By the way, my name's Jones
Hey, I know a place, it's not far from here
That's my dented red Chevy out front
You can follow me there

There's no neon lights
It don't stink of beer
It's just a mile up the road
It's just a minute from here

These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto and if it feels right
These arms are open all night

Now the band is through, they're breaking down the drums
The took the singer's keys, man, he was really drunk
They're turning on the lights, we can't stay here no more
Yeah, I can take a hint, find my way out the door

So what do you think?
Hey, are you going my way?
There's still a whole lot left to this night
Baby, what do you say?

These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto and if it feels right
These arms are open all night

God only knows how long it's been that I been this lonely
Back there at the stop sign
I see her headlights
I think she's coming with me

These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto and if it feels right
These arms are open all night
They're open all night
