
First time I heard the music 
I thought it was my own 
I could feel it in my heartbeat 
I could feel it in my bones 
My momma thinks I'm crazy 
My dad says I'm insane 
I got this boogie woogie fever 
That's burning in my veins 

They tried to take me to a doctor 
But it's too late for me 
Then they took me to a preacher 
That they saw on their TV 
Who said that for a small donation 
My lost soul would be saved 
I said I don't think so preacher 
I'll come back another day 

All I want, is to be a Rolling Stone 
They don't understand what we all know 

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 

My teachers didn't like me they always 
Tried to put me down 
'Cause I wore my hair too long 
I played my music way too loud 

Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar 
So he can pick up all the chicks 
And be a rock-n-roll star 

They said it won't last, but they misunderstood 
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good 

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love 
Dad don't understand what the little girls know 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll 

All I wanted, all I ever needed 
My guitar gave to me 
Every song I've sung blame it on love 

Every war I've won blame it on love 
Everything I've done blame it on love 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll 

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love 
Dad don't understand 
what the little girls know 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll
