
And I would give up tomorrow
And die for one yesterday
I'd lie, beg, steal and borrow
To hear you whisper my name

Tonight there ain't no miracles
Washing up on this beach
The angels left here long ago
But I still believe

That maybe someday
I will hold your hand
And maybe someway
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand
And just walk away
Maybe someday

Now I don't know how a heart beats
But I sure know how one breaks
Remember how I used to hold you
To share every breath that you'd take

How can I forget
You're every tear that I cry?
I know you're coming back
You never kissed me goodbye

Maybe someday
I will hold your hand
And maybe someway
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand
And just walk away

They say that nothing lasts forever
But we know our two hearts beat together
And though you're far away, every night I pray
Maybe someday, someday

Maybe someday
I will understand
Maybe someway
We'll trace these footsteps in the sand
Just walk away

Maybe someday
Maybe someday
Maybe someday
Maybe someway
