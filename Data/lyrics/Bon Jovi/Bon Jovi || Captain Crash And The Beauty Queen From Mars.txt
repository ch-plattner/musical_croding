
Dressed up for a big date 
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now 
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face 
She was one of a kind 
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella 
And roller skates in bed 

Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown 
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now 
Mixed up as a milkshake 
But make no mistake 
They're shooting for the stars 

[Chorus:]
You and me 
We're invincible together 
We can be also tragical, whatever 
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar 
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars 

Share a toothpick, trading lipstick 
Watching traffic for days at the diner 
Holding hands, making big plans 
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner 
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm 

[Chorus:]
You and me 
We're invincible together 
We can be also tragical, whatever 
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar 
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars 

They're drunk on love as you can get 
Getting high on lust and cigarettes 
Living life with no regrets 
At least they're gonna try to fly 

[Chorus:]
You and me 
We're invincible together 
We can be so tragical, whatever 
We're Sid and Nancy 
Fred and Ginger 
Clyde and Bonnie 
Liz and Richard 
Kurt and Courtney 
Bacall and Bogie 
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe
Here's captain crash and the beauty queen from mars
