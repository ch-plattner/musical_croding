
Here we stand, caught between the cradle and the grave
In a world that gives you nothing but your name
With every step you take, you must be brave
Nothing lost is nothing gained

And I know lives are lost for crowns and kings
We all know love is lost for lesser things
And the angels here have broken wings
Though I know somewhere a choir sings

You gotta have a reason
A reason to believe
A reason just to dream
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
A reason to believe

A hot-headed hero, here you see I'm just a man
Comes a time, a time to make a stand, yeah
So here I am with heart in hand
Don't be afraid to understand

You gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
A reason to believe in trust

I believe in faith
I believe in us
'Til my dying day
You gotta have a reason
Whoa, you gotta have a reason, yeah

If all we've got is you and me
Then what we've got is all we need

You gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
One reason

You gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
One reason

You gotta have a reason
Whoa, you gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream, yeah
