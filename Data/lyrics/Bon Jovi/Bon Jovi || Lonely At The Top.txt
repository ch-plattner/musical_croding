Tell Franie I'm sorry she didn't get to know her dad 
I'll bet he's sorry he didn't get to know you too 
Tell her there'll be people singing things that make her sad 
How her daddy felt alone how he was hurtin' bad 
I guess that won't be too far from the truth 

Yeah, it's lonely at the top 
Happy is one thing it's not. 

I was jaded, suffocated, it got too hard to breath 
But never got as high as I needed to be 
You know life becomes worthless when they steal your dreams 
I just couldn't live with what was left for me 
And I couldn't run far enough from the truth, what's the use 

Yeah, it's lonely at the top 
Happy's one thing it's not 

Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down 
No one there can help you stop before you hit the ground 
It's lonely at the top 

Oooh yeah, 

Tell Franie, I'm sorry I better kiss her when she cries 
I'm sorry I left her, never said good-bye 
Didn't mean to leave you all alone but then the music died 
Though the song remains the same, I couldn't live that lie 
You know that ain't too far from the truth 
And you know that ain't too far from the truth 

Yeah, it's lonely at the top 
Happy's one thing it's not 

Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down 
No one there to help you stop before you hit the ground 
Yeah, it's lonely at the top 
Yeah, it's lonely at the top 
It's lonely
