House of fire, baby

Let's build a house of fire, baby
Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on lets make it our home
Don't need no window to watch you, baby
Don't need no roof overhead
I don't need no key to unlock you, baby
I'll use my lovin' instead

I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
House of fire
House of fire

We don't need to pay rent now, baby
No landlord to throw us out
I want to play in your garden, baby
When you want it give me a shout

I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
that you can't tear down
Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire

Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
that you can't tear down
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
