
I see you looking over your shoulder 
Tell me who do you think's out there 
You're reaching for your four leaf clover 
But baby there ain't no luck down there 
I swear that there's no heart in this city 
It's here the slogan reads 
"Do your time" everybody's doing 
their sentence 
It's just there ain't nobody here 
Who knows just what's the crime 
I watched my father live a lie here 
I'd rather die than fade away 
I read the rules 
And yeah I know them 
Still you ain't ever gonna 
Make me play the game of 
Fear 
Fear 
Fear 
Fear 

Running with the rats 
Through the city 
Makes you feel like you're 
A partner in crime 
Girl once you won't stop to watch 
That little girl did 

Hey baby won't you stop and hear me 
Just being here we're 
breathing heart attacks 
We can run and chase 
The setting sun we can run 
And we won't ever look back 

Take my hand I know we'll make it 
I'll let nothing slow us down 
I know you want to curse 
This place but there's only 
One thing that's stopping us now 

Fear fear fear 
Of a new thing 
Fear fear fear 
Of the brass ring 

You ain't one for taking chances 
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5 
Still that's what you call living 
That's surviving to me 

And surviving is living to die in 
Fear
