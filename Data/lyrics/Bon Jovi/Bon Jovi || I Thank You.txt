
You didn't have to love me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did 
And I thank you 
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

If you took your love to someone else 
I know what I meant to be the loving dare 
You made me feel like I've never felt 
Your kiss is so good, I got the holler for help 

You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
You didn't have to hold me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

Now every day there's something new 
You put your make-up and your mild perfume 
You got me trying to do things, too 
Just so that I can keep up with you 

You didn't have to shake me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
You didn't have to make me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 

All my life I've been short changed 
Without your love it would be a crying shame 
Now I know what love I'm looking for 
When they say they're being turned on 

I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you 
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say 

You didn't have to love me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
You didn't have to hold me, like you did 
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you 
I wanna thank you, baby I wanna thank you, let me count the ways 
Let me thank you, baby, baby I've got something to say 

Thank you baby 
Let me count the ways, for the whole wide world to hear, oh yeah 
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer 
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby 
Thank you for understanding why I was out so late last night 
Thank you for giving me your best friend's phone number 
Thank you for understanding, that me and your sister are just good friends.
