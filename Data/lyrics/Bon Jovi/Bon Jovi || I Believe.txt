All I know is what I've been sold 
You can read my life like a fortune told 
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz 
But I got my brain and I got a heart 
And courage built I won't let go 
What we need right now is ....soul 

I can't do this, you can't do that 
They feed us lines but I won't act 
And all good things will come to pass 
But the truth is all you have to have 
And would you lie for it? 
(Do you) cry for it? 
(Would you) die for it? 
Would you 

I believe, I believe 
With every breath that I breathe 
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream 
I believe, I believe 

You know what you came here for 
You'll pay the cost, 
like it's your cross to bear 
Are we the ones that put it there 
Would you scheme for it 
scream for it, bleed for it 
Would you 

I believe, I believe 
Believe we're still worth 
The fight you'll see 
There's no hope for this world tonight 
I believe, I believe 

Don't look up on your movie screens 
In record stores or magazines 
Close your eyes and you will see 
That you are all you really need 

I believe, I believe 
With every breath that I breathe 
You and me can turn a 
whisper to a scream 
I believe, I believe
