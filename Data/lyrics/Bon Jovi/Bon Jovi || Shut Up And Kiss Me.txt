I don't wanna talk about it
Baby, wanna talk all night
You're on your feet six days a week
We're working nights just tryin' to make ends meet

Break our back on the killin' floor
Another guy's what we're doin' it for
We got a lot, we don't need more

We're rollin', baby
Tell me when you'll go
Rollin', straight on
Tell me where to go

I don't wanna watch the TV
Wash the dishes now or pay the bills
Don't wanna eat, don't need to sleep
The only real meal that gives me a thrill

Don't need no candles, you're the spark
Don't need no matches, just a fire in the dark
We come together, well, that's a good start

Baby, you're crazy
And I know that you can't hide
'Cause this earth anywhere
There up on the other side

Break our back on the killin' floor
Another guy's what we're doin' it for
We got a lot, we don't need more

We're rollin', baby
Tell me when you'll go
Rollin', straight on
Tell me where to go

Baby, you're crazy
And I know that you can't hide
'Cause this earth anywhere
There up on the other side
