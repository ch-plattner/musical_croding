
Love lives in New York City
He got a place off of the park
Heard he was standing in the ruins
And in his hands a broken heart
He called an army of his angels
I heard they had to hide their wings
It was them who brought you water
If you listen closely I know you can hear
The choir singing

[Chorus:]
Hey, hallelujah, baby
Rise Up
Hold out your hands and reach out
Higher
Get up on your feet
Rise Up
Let it flow though you, baby
Run it through your veins
Like a healing rain
Everywhere you'll see
Another reason to believe

I saw him down south of Canal Street
Right there in a mother's eyes
At a table in a restaurant window
In a taxi passing by
Love went running up the stairwell
When the sky came falling down
It was him in a newborn baby's cry
He was there to make that sound
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round

[Chorus:]
Rise Up
Hold out your hands and reach out
Higher
Get up on your feet
Rise Up
Let it flow though you, baby
Run it through your veins
Like a healing rain
Everywhere you'll see
Another reason to believe

It's different than it was before
Now we need it even more
Fire's falling from the sky
Innocence just said goodbye
It may never be the same
Maybe it was time to change
A time to grieve
A time to cry
A time to live
A time to fly
