
The city sounds like a symphony
A cabbie screams obscenities
The horns are honking jazz in the night
Her street is lit like a Christmas tree
This place is my amphetamine
She junks me but it's alright
In her summer dress she parts the sea
Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads
Everyone else is gone but her and me

[Chorus:]
Here she comes, it's crazy love
Here it comes again
That crazy thing called love
Here she comes, it's crazy love
Here it comes again

Sitting on my stoop
I lit one up and put the ashes in my coffee cup
And watched the world passing me by
Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart
Ain't it funny how life imitates art
Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight
But when she's walking down the street
The sidewalk's there to kiss her feet

[Chorus:]
Here she comes, it's crazy love
Here it comes again
That crazy thing called love
Here she comes, it's crazy love
Here it comes again

She needs me, pleads me
Wraps me in her loving charms
She'll tease me, squeeze me
But I'm the man when I'm in her arms
Now the angels sing a melody
That they wrote for her explicitly
That no one hears but her and me
Now wait a minute… wait I can't believe my eyes
Who's that coming around the corner?
Ay, she's lookin' fine ain't she? … get out the way!
No, no, no get out the way… look at those high heel sneakers…

[Chorus:]
Here she comes, it's crazy love
Here it comes again
That crazy thing called love
Here she comes, it's crazy love
