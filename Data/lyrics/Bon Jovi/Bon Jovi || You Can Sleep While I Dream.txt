
You're boy sits down to write a song
'Cause he thinks he's got something to say
Innocence thinks it can change the world
But the world keeps getting in the way

It's a small list for the optimist who believes that he can fly
In a long line full of pessimists to stop him every time he tries
Some people see things as they are and ask, why
I dream things that never were, I take my shot and say, "Why not?"

Hey, hey, hey, this one's for the dreamers
Hey, hey, hey, doubting disbelievers, get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking, scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

Convicted by convictions, they were carving out your cross
They came to take your measurements just to show you who's the boss
Until I reach that promised land I won't stop
When I get there I'll shake your hand so meet me on that mountain top

Hey, hey, hey, this one's for the dreamers
Hey, hey, hey, doubting disbelievers, get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking, scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

(Hey, hey, hey)
This one's for the breathing
Hey, hey, hey forgotten and the bleeding
I may whisper but I'm screaming, I got angels, I got demons
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

I'm not suggesting that you fly with me
Well here's a dose of some reality, you're swinging at a change-up
Boy you better shape up, here comes the wrecking ball
Good morning, here's your wake-up call

(Hey, hey, hey)
I feel the change a comin'
Hey, hey, hey see that train a comin'
(Hey, hey, hey)
This one's for the dreamers
Hey, hey, hey doubting disbelievers, get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking, I'm scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

(Hey, hey, hey)
This one's for the breathing
Hey, hey, hey the dying and the bleeding, get out of my way
I may whisper but I'm screaming, I got angels, I got demons
Baby, you can sleep while I dream

(Hey, hey, hey)
When I dream
(Hey, hey, hey)
And I dream
(Hey, hey, hey)
I dream
(Hey, hey, hey)

(Hey, hey, hey)
I can feel the change a coming
(Hey, hey, hey)
I see that train a coming
(Hey, hey, hey)
Can you see it?
(Hey, hey, hey)
And baby, you can sleep while I dream
