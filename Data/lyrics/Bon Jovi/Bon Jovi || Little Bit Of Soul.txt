You been robbed 
You been used 
You been crucified and 
You been abused 
You been sacrificen and 
Now you're confused 
Ain't it the truth 

You got a hole in your head 
And a cold empty spot 
In your big brass bed 
When you're mad at the world and 
You feel like you're losing control 
All you need to get by is 
A little bit o soul 

When you've lost in the flood 
And you feel like you been 
Kicked through the mud 
You know they still 
Haven't found the drug 
To pick us up 

Feeling down, misunderstood 
You know these times 
They ain't looking so good 
When you're mad at the world and 
You feel like you're losing control 
What we all need to get by is 
A little o soul 

Whoa oh 
Little bit of soul 
What we all need 
To survive 
Is just 
A little bit o soul 

Everyone's complaining 
Nothing but frustration 
The king has pissed in 
Your pot of gold 
It ain't entertaining spending 
So much time in the hole 
Send down 
A little bit o soul 

When you're mad at the world 
And you feel like 
You're losing control 
What we all need 
To get by is just 
A little bit o soul 

Whoa oh little bit o soul 

Whoa oh little bit o soul 

Whoa oh little bit o soul
