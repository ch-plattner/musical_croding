
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried 
Still it's so hard for her to notice 
I've tried hard to be straight 
There's nothing left I can say 
If only she would look my way 

[Chorus:]
She don't know me, she don't know 
She don't see me, she don't care 
She can't hear me, can't hear 
Can not help me, she don't want 
She don't want me like I want her 
Like I wan't her got to tell her 
Got to tell her that I love her 
That I love her 
She doesn't even know my name 

I dream of when she'll be mine 
I dream of crossing that line 
And holding her so tender 
Dreaming it could come true 
So many things I would do 
If only you'd give me a chance 

[Repeat chorus]
