We met some time ago, when we were almost young 
It never crossed my mind to ask, where did you come from? 
I didn't have much money, so I stole you a rose 
You were dressed like an orphan, in Salvation Army clothes 

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 

I know I wasn't funny, but you laughed at all my jokes 
When I was chaking on the words to say 
You shoved your finger down my throat 
The first night I said I loved you, you told me to go to hell 
You were giving he head, on that creeky 
Old bed at the Ol'Duvol Motel 

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 

I would drink of your river, it would always get me high 
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine 

I never thought I'd love ya, no - I'd rather go blind 
I thought I saw the future, but the fortune teller lied 
I guess she lied 

Just like everything, even good love has to die 
Ain't no sympathy when it waves goodbye, no one even cried 
We were one of a kind 

I would drink of your river, it would always get me high 
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine 

I never thought I'd love ya, no - I'd rather go blind 
I thought I saw the future, but the fortune teller lied 
I guess she lied
