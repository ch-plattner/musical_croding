So this is it
Here it is
A pot of gold
A Judas kiss
I got what I wanted
I paid every cost
I'd give it all back
To get back what I've lost
Like a wave on the beach
Last leaf on the tree
It's all just a memory

Love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My treasure just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I'll fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No time for goodbye
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea

They shake my hand
Pat my back
They know my drink
Welcome back
The life of the party
Tears of a clown
Can't hear a heartbreak
The music's too loud

Love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My treasure just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No time for goodbye
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea

It's just broken glass
Chalk lines on the scene
Move along, move along
Ain't nothing here to see

Oh, love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My riches just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No bitter goodbyes
Oh, love pick me up
Oh, love pick me up
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea
A teardrop to the sea

A teardrop to the sea
