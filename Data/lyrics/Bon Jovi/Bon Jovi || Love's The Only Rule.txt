
I don't give a damn 
How it's supposed to be
That might work for you
It don't work for me

You write your truth 
And I'll write mine
One man's ceiling's 
Another man's sky high

Flying like an aeroplane
Crying Like the lonely whistle of a long black train
Dance in the pouring rain
Spit in the eye of a hurricane
Who said life has got to be so cruel
Love's the only rule

It's written in the scars
Where I fit in
It's going to hurt sometimes 
You got to lose to win

You've got your sins 
And I got mine
Sell your secrets kiss them all goodbye

Flying like an aeroplane
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane
Run like it's a getaway
Say those things that you shouldn't say
Think about it wouldn't that be cool?
If love's the only rule

Might be a wrecking ball
Or just a wake up call
Don't matter where the peices fall

Wooooah, wooooah, wooooah

I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane
Cry like the whistle of a long black train
Dance in the pouring rain
I'm alive like a lonely not from John Coltrane
Run like it's a getaway
Say those things that you souldn't say

Where love, love's the only rules
Yes love, love's the only rule
Ah love, love's the only rule
Love, only rule
Love's the only rule

Wooooah, wooooah , wooooah
