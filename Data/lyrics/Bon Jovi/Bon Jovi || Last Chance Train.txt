
October leaves are falling, so am I
A harvest moon is calling me and I know why
The traffic's like a symphony in blue

In the autumn air I smell your sweet perfume
I miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room
Yesterdays are eating me alive

I'm your angel, baby
I've got broken wings
I can't walk, I can't run, I can't drop
Until you're next to me, so the only thing

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train
Leave a flower the station
I know my destination
Love bring me home again

You try to reach me but I've sailed away
You tried to read me but my words got in the way
The music's over but the dance has just begun

I wish that I could just get back to Baltimore
You know I'd scratch, I'd claw, I'd scream
Till I'm raw, just to fall down at your door

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train
Leave a flower at the station
I know my destination
Love bring me home again

Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks
At the broken hearts that don't come back
'Cause the train has left the station with my pain
Let them forget my name, oh

I'm on a last chance train

Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette
Now all that's left are ashes, butts and my regrets
It's your taste that I just can't forget

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train

Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks
At the broken hearts that don't come back
We'll be laughing at them, crying in the rain
It's you and I again, oh

You gotta meet me tonight
I'm on a last chance train
Leave a flower at the station
I know my destination
Love bring me home again

I'm on a last chance train
It's gonna bring me home to you
Oh, the last chance train
Coming through, my babe
This time I'm coming through
Coming through
