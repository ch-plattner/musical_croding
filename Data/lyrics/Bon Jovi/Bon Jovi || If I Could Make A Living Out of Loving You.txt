
If there's something that needs fixing 
I'm the man to see 
Look me up, I'm listed 
Just check under "B" 
If you're ever on the spot 
Well, I'm good with my hands 
24-7 I'm your handyman 

Odd jobs, hard jobs, anything under the sun 
Big jobs, small jobs, baby 

[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
These two hands know what to do 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
I could make a living out of lovin' you 

Until the work is finished 
Well, I don't get paid 
I don't mind getting dirty 
That's my middle name 
I'm in the service business 
So I understand 
Call me 24-7, I'm your handyman 

Odd jobs, hard jobs, anything under the sun 
Big jobs, small jobs, baby 

[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
These two hands know what to do 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 

[Solo ]

Tough jobs, rough jobs, say where and when 
I'll leave you my card, call when you need me again 
Odd jobs, hard jobs, baby 

[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
These two hands know what to do 
If I could make a living out of lovin' you 
I'd be a rich man, it's true 
I could make a living out of lovin' you 
I'm a rich man 
I could make a living out of lovin' you
