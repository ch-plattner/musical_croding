Bad, bad, bad boys

You say, you don't like my kind
A bitter picture in your mind
No, it don't matter what I say
I hear you bitchin' when I walk away

I'll never be what you want me to be
You tell me I'm wrong but I disagree

I ain't got no apology
Just because I don't look like you
Talk like you, think like you
Judge and jury, a hangman's noose
I see them in your eyes

Good guys don't always wear white
Good guys don't always wear white

You judge a man who don't stand in line
Just because he ain't on your side
You know the man who wears those shoes
If you cut me don't I bleed like you? You know I do

I don't know what you've been told
Can't buy guts with a pot o' gold
A rich man's poor if he got no soul

Rich man, poor man, beggar man, king
All that shit don't mean a thing
Do you know which one's behind those eyes?
It's all a disguise, just go away

Good guys don't always wear white
Good guys don't always wear white
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey baby, whose side you on?
You think, you got it all figured out where we belong
Forget all about your dark from light
Day from night, wrong from right

Good guys don't always wear white
Good guys don't always wear white
You know that good guys don't always wear white
Good guys don't always wear white
Tell your mama, baby
Good guys don't always wear white

Don't always wear, don't always wear
Don't always wear, don't always wear
Don't always wear, don't always wear white
