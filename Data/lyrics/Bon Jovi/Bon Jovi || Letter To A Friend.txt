
I'll be there to hold you by the hand
When you need someone to walk you home
You know that I'll be there to understand
When you call me on the phone

And I'll be there to watch you when you sleep
When you close your eyes at night
And I'll be there to keep your secrets kept
Cross my heart, hope to die, I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do

I'll be there when you need a real friend
I'll be there to listen to your secrets
I'll be there and give you all I've got
I'll be there when you paint your masterpiece

And I'll be right beside your every move
I'll give you my eyes so you can see
And I'll help you to find the things you've lost
When you're busting at the seams

I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you
I ain't gonna love you

Nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and plead, get down on the knees
I'd do most anything it's true but I ain't gonna love you, I ain't gonna love you

Because I love you

I'll be there to love the things you love
I'll be the one who knows your middle name
Be the only one that you can trust
I'll give you the blood that's in my veins

I swear these words are true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you

'Cause nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and plead, get down on my knees
Do most anything for you, but I ain't gonna love you, I ain't gonna love you

Because I love you
Because I love you
