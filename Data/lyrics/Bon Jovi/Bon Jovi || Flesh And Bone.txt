
They judge you by your money
Or the color of your skin
They read you by the cover
Don't take time to read within
They judge you without jury
And you struggle to believe
No one could hear your story
Even justice had to leave

All I know (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)

They build the walls around you
And they tell you you don't fit
And still you think you know me
You don't know the half of it
I'm a beggar, you're a savior
I'm your devil, you're a thief
I'll be here until you realize
I'm you and you are me

All that I know (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
All that I know (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)

Do the cuts bleed any different
On a pauper or a king?
When it comes down to dying
The crown don't mean a thing
No, no, no

(All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (All we are is on all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
(All we are is all alone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (Man is made of flesh & bone)
Man is made of flesh & bone (All we are is on all alone)
