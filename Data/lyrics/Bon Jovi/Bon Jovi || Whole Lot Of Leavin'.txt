It's pretty cold for late September
And autumn wind is creepin' in
The summer sun packed up it's long gone
There's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

Yeah!

I bet it's warm in California
I think it's time to hit the road
I just might call that plain of gypsies
Whose searching for our pot of gold

Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

Close the window draw the curtains
You ain't the only one here hurt
No one's right no one's wrong

Lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

You used to live to say you love me
Now you got one foot of the door
It's then you turn around and ask me
Do we got it anymore

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I need find a reason to be strong

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
Yeah I hold the line you'll never hear me say goodbye
So pretty thing let the years be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I'll come back for you baby
