
So now it's over, let the spot light fade
I hear the music slowly fade away
And now I find it hard to say goodbye
So I'll just say goodnight, my friends

The end
(We'll be together)
The end
(We'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end

The end
(Although it's over)
The end
(It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end

If every moment is a memory
A faded photograph of days gone by
Can I take a little piece of you with me
For when I leave this all behind

The end
(We'll be together)
The end
(We'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end

The end
(Although it's over)
The end
(It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end

Come on, come on, come on
Darling, lay you head down
Come on, come on, come on
Little Darling, help me, baby
'Cause I can't see the lights

I'm getting tired so I close my eyes
I need to look at you just one more time
And though it's over, it's never over
Until I see you again

The end
(We'll be together)
The end
(We'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end

The end
(Although it's over)
The end
(It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end

The end
(We'll be together)
The end
(We'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end

The end
(Although it's over)
The end
(It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end
