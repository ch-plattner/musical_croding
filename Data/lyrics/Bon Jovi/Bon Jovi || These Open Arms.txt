
What if everything you always took for granted, was gone?
And everything you ever thought was right, was wrong?
And what if everyone you ever loved was torn, from the pages of your life?
Would you reach out for tomorrow, or try to turn back time?

These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you

Did you really love the ones you said you loved, that's right?
And did you make a damn of difference in somebody else's life?
Tell me, is there someone you can count on when you need a friend?
Can you say I need a friend?

These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between whats left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you

Can you live in your skin, walk in your own shoes?
You can't win, if you don't know how to lose
Crawl, fall, Jonny gotta learn to fly

These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you
