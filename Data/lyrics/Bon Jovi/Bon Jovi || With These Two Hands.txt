I could roll the dice
And give you ten good reasons
I could break the ice
And pick up the broken pieces

I could wave hello, I could raise a glass,
I could blow a kiss, I could kick your ass
We could take it all apart or hold it all together

With these two hands I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands

I could strike a match that sets the world on fire
Hold a grain of sand till it turns into a diamond

I could plant the seed, I could flip that switch, 
Make the sign of peace, I could make a fist
Oh, we could make this hurt or we could make it better

With these two hands I can tear down walls,
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands

Wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Reach up until we touch the sky
Free to dream and make it true
No, there ain't nothing we can't do
Oh, there ain't nothing we can't do

With these two hands I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands

Wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Reach up until we touch the sky
Free to dream and make it true
No, there ain't nothing we can't do
Oh, there ain't nothing we can't do.
