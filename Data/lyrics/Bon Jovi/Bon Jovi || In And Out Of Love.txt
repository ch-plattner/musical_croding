Young and wired 
Set to explode in the heat 
You won't tire 
Cause baby was born with the beat 
Take you higher than you've ever known 
Then drive you down to your knees 
I'll  pick you up when you've had enough 
You been burned baby lessons learned 

[Chorus:]
In and out of love 
Hear what I'm sayin' 
In and out of love 
It's the way that we're playing 
In and out of love 
Too much is never enough 
She's gonna get ya 

Running wild 
When me and my boys hit the streets 
Right on time 
She's here to make my night complete 
Then I'm long gone I got another show 
One more town, one mile to go 
One endless night of fantasy 
Is all she left of her with me 

[Chorus]
