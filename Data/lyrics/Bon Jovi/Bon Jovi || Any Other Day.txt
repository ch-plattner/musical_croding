
Alarm clock rings, it's 6:45,
Must have hit that snooze button least 3 times,
Wishing this morning was still last night,
On any other day, just might wanna die.

Traffics backed up 20 miles to the east,
Must have hit every damn red light on the street,
Weatherman says "It's gonna rain for a week"
Hey, what can you do?

[CHORUS:]
On any other day, I'd be blue eyes cryin',
I could tell the world, 'At least I'm tryin',
The clouds are breakin',
The sun is shinin' new for me and you.
On any other day, I would just go crazy,
the grace is knowing that you're gonna save me,
Baby luck and love,
Will pull us through?
On any other day
Yeah, Yeah!

On any other day, I might just stay in bed
Sit down in a sea of blankets
Pull them up over my head
Get your papers in the morning

Just to get a little edge

Then maybe just give up in time to do it all again
Hey, I like where this is going
Yeah, 'cause I know where it's been

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Alarm clock rings, it's 6:45,
I like waking up with you on my mind
Knowing that you're saving me
One more time.

On any other day, I would just go crazy,
the grace is knowing that you're gonna save me,
Baby luck and love,
Will pull us through?
On any other day
Yeah, Yeah!
