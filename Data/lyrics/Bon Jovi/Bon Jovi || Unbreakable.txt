
You said you made me and you break me
You said it ain't hard to shake me
You threw me ever since you've taken me down

You came like a rainy grey monday
I prayed like it was a sunday
You say, you say
But I won't run away, I'll be standing my ground

Seen all the screaming and fighting
Lived through the screaming and lying
I'm fine, you can't deny

I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable

Don't need the diamond cards or cold cash
Don't need to sell my soul so don't ask
Took a pass on the bass I'd be leaving right now

Newsflash, I'm causing a commotion
Jump back, I'm poetry in motion,
Think fast, talk trash
Well I ain't talking back but I'm calling you out

No time for fussing and fighting
Lived through the screaming and the lying
I'm fine, you can't deny

I'm unbreakable
Unstoppable
I'm invincible
You're gonna bring it to me

I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable

Newsflash, I'm causing a commotion
Jump back, I'm poetry in motion,
I'm fine, you can't deny

I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable

Unstoppable, I'm invincible, you're gonna bring it to me
Cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable

I will be unbreakable, unbreakable, I will be unbreakable
