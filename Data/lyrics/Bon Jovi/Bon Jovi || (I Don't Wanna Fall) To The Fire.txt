
We would take no prisoners 
'Cause there was nobody giving in 
They came walking through my jungle 
And met an angel about to sin 
I heard a voice from inside of me 
When the youth of America cried: 
Can you help me, hear me call 

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
To the fire 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
To the fire 

When you're a part of society 
You know, the heart of your innocence dies 
When we met with Authority 
I looked him right between the eyes 
'Cause all we had was our innocence 
All we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me... 
Can you save me, from it all 

[Chorus]

Can you help me, hear me call 
Can you save me, from it all 

[Chorus]
