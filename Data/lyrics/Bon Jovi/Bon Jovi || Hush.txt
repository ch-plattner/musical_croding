
She says, "baby"
I love it when she calls me baby
She says, "It's 4 am, why don't you grab your shoes
Come on over and then maybe..."

She drives me crazy
You know she knows she drives me crazy
Well she says,"let's pretend there's beer, champagne
We'll beet out the pouring rain
And I'll let ya
Drive me crazy"

Well she don't talk about love
We don't tak about us
What we don't say with words,
We say when we touch.

Hush
Come wrap your arms around me
Hush
We don't have to talk tonight so
Hush
Now we got some better crush
We don't have to say to much
Write a book each time we touch
Hush

Said nothing
Sometimes so little said is something
There's ten things I could've said
But we don't waste time on that shit
So we rise above it

Well she don't talk about love
And we don't talk too much
What we don't say with words
We say when we touch

Hush
Come wrap your arms around me
Hush
We don't have to talk tonight now
Hush
Now we got some better crush
We don't have to say to much
write a book each time we touch
Hush

We don't gotta talk about love
We don't gotta talk about us
We don't wanna give away too much

Hush
Come wrap your arms around me
Hush
We don't have to talk tonight now
Hush
Now we got some better crush
We don't have to write a book each time we touch
Hush
