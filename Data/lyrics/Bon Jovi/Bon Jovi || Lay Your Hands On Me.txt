
If you're ready, I'm willing and able 
Help me lay my cards out on the table 
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking 
Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking 

What you get ain't always what you see 
But satisfaction's guaranteed 
They say what you give is always what you need 
So if you want me to lay my hands on you 

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 

Lay your hands on me 

I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher 
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher 
If you show me how to get up off the ground 
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down 

Everything you want is what I need 
Satisfaction's guaranteed 
But the ride don't never ever come for free 
If you want me to lay my hands on you 

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 

Lay your hands on me 

[Solo] 

Don't you know I only aim to please 
If you want me to lay my hands on you 

Lay your hands on me
