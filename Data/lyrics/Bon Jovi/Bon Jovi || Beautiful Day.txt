
Oh, what a day to be here
It's only at this time of year
Oh, what a sight, what a scene
And we can live in this dream
It's that time in your life
You need the day to happen twice
I'll take a pad and a pen
And hope it happens again

Oh, what a day to be out
There's music in every sound
It's good to breathe in the air
It's all around us, everywhere
It's that time in your life
You want a day to happen twice
So between now and then
I hope it happens again

Oh, come and share this beautiful day
The sun is here again
Until tomorrow begins
We'll stay right here
Oh, come and share this beautiful day
Before it's taken away
The whole world is smiling on this beautiful day

Oh, what a day to be out
There's music in every sound
It's good to breathe in the air
It's all around us, everywhere
It's that time in your life
You want a day to happen twice
So between now and then
I hope it happens again

Oh, come and share this beautiful day
The sun is here again
Until tomorrow begins
We'll stay right here
Oh, come and share this beautiful day
Before it's taken away
The whole world is smiling on this beautiful day

Listen to the laughter on this beautiful day
Happy ever after on this beautiful day

It's that time in your life
You want a day to happen twice
I'll take a pad and a pen
And hope it happens again

Oh, come and share this beautiful day
The sun is here again
Until tomorrow begins
We'll stay right here
Oh, come and share this beautiful day
Before it's taken away
The whole world is smiling on this beautiful day
