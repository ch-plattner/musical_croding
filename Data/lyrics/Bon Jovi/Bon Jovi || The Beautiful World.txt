
Every day it's the same when they say that it might be the end
In the end when it ends then I'll listen to them
You wake up, go to work, go to sleep
Then you do it, you do it, if you're lucky then you do it again
Yeah, we walk through a world that we don't understand
When I look in your eyes I'm just happy I can
Yeah, we'll laugh and we'll cry and we'll lose and we'll win
We'll get through it and to prove it yeah we'll do it again

There's glory in the saddest story

Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?

It's a shame when they say that it's been done and said
They keep digging that grave, let them bury their heads
There's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars
There's another first kiss in the back of some car

Turn a page and write the story

Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?

They're running numbers out of the Spanish grocery
Mary Mary says her rosary
We get a ladder, there's a cat up in a tree
Ah

The Pretzel man's wearing Gucci glasses
A widow spreads her lover's ashes
I'll hold on to you, hold on to me, yeah
We'll do it, we'll do it, yeah, we're lucky then we'll do it again
Ah

Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty string of pearl.
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?

Oh, ain't it a beautiful world?
Oh, oh, ain't it a beautiful world?
