
Long slow drive down an old dirt road
You've got your hand out the window, listening to the radio
That's where I wanna be...

On an old park bench in the middle of December
Cold hard rain fallin', can't find no cover
That would be alright with me...

Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights
Baby, I want you to take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you

In the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulder
Smokin' on a cheap cigar...that would be alright with me
In the back row of a movie or a cross-town train
I wanna hear your voice whispering my name...that's where I wanna be

Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights

Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you

Life is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' around
When you get to the top it's hard to look down
Just hang on ... we'll make it through
Save me ... a seat next to you

When you get to the gates and the angels sing
Go to that place where the church bells ring
You know I'll come runnin' ... runnin' to find you

Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe I want you to save me ... a seat next to you
A seat next to you
A seat ... next to you
A seat ... next to you
