I’m in this war
But got no gun
Still standing strong
An army of one
So sign me up
I’m a soldier

I’ve got a voice
It’s all I need
A beating heart inside of me
I’m an army of one
I’m a soldier

These eyes hold no disguise
We’re fighting for our lives
We’re all trying to get back home tonight

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one

I can’t hurt but I still feel
I know that life’s a battlefield
When the times get tough
I’m a soldier

And when it’s time to face the fight
With just my shadow at my side
I’m an army of one
I’m a soldier

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one

So don't apologize
Defend, just be alive
We’re all trying
To get it right tonight

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one
