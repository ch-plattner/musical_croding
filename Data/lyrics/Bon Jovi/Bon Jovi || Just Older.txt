
Hey, man, it's been a while 
Do you remember me? 
When I hit the streets I was 17 
A little wild, a little green 
I've been up and down and in between 
After all these years and miles of memories
I'm still chasing dreams
But I ain't looking over my shoulder 

[Chorus:] 
I like the bed I'm sleeping in 
It's just like me, it's broken in 
It's not old - just older 
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans 
This skin I'm in it's alright with me 
It's not old - just older 

It's good to see your face 
You ain't no worse for wear 
Breathing that California air 
When we took on the world 
When we were young and brave 
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave 
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder 

[Chorus:]
I like the bed I'm sleeping in 
It's just like me, it's broken in 
It's not old - just older 
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans 
This skin I'm in it's alright with me 
It's not old - just older 

I'm not old enough to sing the blues 
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes 
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff 
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose 

[Solo]

Well, I look in the mirror 
I don't hate what I see 
There's a few more lines staring back at me 
Now the nights has grown a little colder 
Hey man, I gotta run 
Now you take care 
If you see coach T. Tell him I've cut my hair 
I've kept my faith
I still belive I'm just...
Ha

[Chorus:] 
I like the bed I'm sleeping in 
It's just like me, it's broken in 
It's not old - just older 
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans 
This skin I'm in it's alright with me 
It's not old - just older
