Time ain't nothing but time 
It's a verse with no rhyme 
Man, it all comes down to you 

Change ain't nothing but change 
Just the faces and the names 
But you know we're gonna make it through 

I'll believe 
When you don't believe in anything 

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 

I, when I think that I'm losing my mind 
It all comes back to you 

And you, you know that it's true 
After all we've been through 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 

Stand by me 
And I would gladly give up everything 

[Chorus:] 
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 

I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here
For the next 100 years
