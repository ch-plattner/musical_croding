
As a hard rain beats down in the night it sounds like applause
Still I can't hear a sound with the beat of my heart
I can't pick up that phone anymore and I need to confess
If I don't say 'I love you' everything else is a waste of my breathe

[Chorus:]
Every beat of my heart I would give
Every beat of my heart just to live
To live for your love, if all that I want
Is to die in your arms
I'd give you every beat of my heart

As I whisper your name I wish you were here by my side
And the only way that I find you is when I close my eyes
With my ring on your finger I hope and I pray
That you know deep in your soul with every step that you take

[Chorus:]
Every beat of my heart I would give
Every beat of my heart just to live
I live for your love, if all that I want
Is to die in your arms
I'd give you every beat of my heart

It's the little things that you do that make me want you more
It's the way your hands are trembling but what they trembling for?
It's the way the smile fits on your lips
The way you hold me tight
God knows I'd give everything to be in your arms tonight

[Chorus:]
I live for your love, it's all that I want
Is to die in your arms
I'd give you every beat of my heart
Just to live
Every beat of my heart, just to live
I live for your love, it's all that I want
To die in your arms
I'd give you every beat of my heart
Give you every beat of my heart
Give you every beat of my heart
Give you every beat of my heart
Give you every beat of my heart
