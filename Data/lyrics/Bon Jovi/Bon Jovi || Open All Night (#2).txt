
So you packed your bags you said you're leaving tonight
You gotta catch the last train to the pixie lights
It's your life, better get on board
Got all dolled up in your Sunday shoes
You got that lipstick on, nothing to lose
Except me, baby,singing the blues
So go on now just walk away,baby
Don't look back, you just drive me crazy,baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus:]
Don't worry about me,
I'll get along I'm like a neon sign that's always on
It's alright
I'm open all night
I'll be here waiting no matter how long
I'll keep the jukebox playing our favorite song
Hey, if you're lonely,
I'm open all night
Open all night
I'll never turn out the lights
Open all night

You wave goodbye said baby, good luck
You better chase your dreams before they rust
Get what you can and hope it's enough
Go on now, you're on your way, baby
Break some hearts, hearts can break easy - baby,
baby, baby, baby

[Chorus:]
Don't worry about me,
I'll get along
I'm like a neon sign that's always on
It's alright,
I'm open all night
I'll be here waiting no matter how long
I'll keep the jukebox playing our favorite song
Hey, if you're lonely,
I'm open all night
Open all night
I'll never turn out the lights
Open all night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If anybody had a heart, oh, if anybody had a heart... 
They'd know how much, just how much I want you...

[Chorus:]
Open all night,
I'll never turn out the lights
Don't worry about me,
I'll get along I'm like a neon sigh that's always on
It's alright,
I'm open all night
I'll be here waiting no matter how long
I'll keep the jukebox playing our favorite song
If you're lonely,
I'm open all night
Open all night
I'll never turn out the lights
Open all night Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
