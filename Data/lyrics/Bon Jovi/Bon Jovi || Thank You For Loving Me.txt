
It's hard for me to say the things 
I want to say sometimes 
There's no one here but you and me 
And that broken old street light 
Lock the doors 
We'll leave the world outside 
All I've got to give to you 
Are these five words tonight

[Chorus:]
Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
For parting my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 
Thank you for loving me 

I never knew I had a dream 
Until that dream was you 
When I look into your eyes 
The sky's a different blue 
Cross my heart 
I wear no disguise 
If I tried, you'd make believe 
That you believed my lies 

[Chorus:]
Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
For parting my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 

You pick me up when I fall down 
You ring the bell before they count me out 
If I was drowning you would part the sea 
And risk your own life to rescue me 

[Solo]

Lock the doors 
We'll leave the world outside 
All I've got to give to you 
Are these five words tonight

[Chorus:]
Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
You parted my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 

When I couldn't fly 
Oh, you gave me wings 
You parted my lips 
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
