
Look at this world
It's filled with worn out faces
Forgotten places and nothing changes
Whatever happened to that new day rising
We're just surviving when living is dying

Aren't you tired of being let down?
Another day, another shakedown

I'm with you

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
(I'm with you)

If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)

I walk in shadows that seem all familiar
I've read the papers, life forsaken
A vacant store front, I want more for sale sign
Down on main street you just walk by

How many times we gotta break down
Before somebody's gonna shout out?

I'm with you

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
(I'm with you)

If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)

[Guitar Solo]

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use" (you say, "It's no use")

Well, I've got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)

I'm with you.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
