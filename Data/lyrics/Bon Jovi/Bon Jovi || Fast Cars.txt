
How can I defend
"Let's live for now not then"
We're chasing tail lights
Let them fade into the distance
Let's say the engine stalled and start again
Turn around let's turn around
It's a dark road we been heading down
Trust me tonight I swear I know where we are
We're gonna run all the lights
We're gonna blow right through the radar

Fast cars
We are fast cars

How can I pretend the signs don't say dead end
So many hearts just wind up in a junkyard
Where memories are nothing but spare parts
Turn around just turn around
And leave the past behind us now
Come on we aint gonna crash
This time we ain't slowing down
we'll pull ahed of the pack
Slip thru the cracks cause we are

Fast cars
On a long ride take your foot off the brake
Let's just put it in drive
We are fast cars on the inside
There's no turning back
On the highway of life
Fast cars
We are fast cars

(Sha La Sha La)
Flying through the stop signs
(Sha La Sha La)
Running over bad times
(Sha La Sha La)
Gunning down the daylight
Counting days like white lines
Holding on for our lives

We are fast cars

We are fast cars
On a long ride take your foot off the brake
Let's just put it in drive
We are fast cars on the inside
There's no turning back on this highway tonight
(Sha La Sha La)
(Sha La Sha La)
We are fast cars
(Sha La Sha La)
We are fast cars
We are fast cars
