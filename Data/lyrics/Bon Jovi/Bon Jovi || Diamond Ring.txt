
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand 
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man 
Diamond ring, diamond ring 
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring 

Red, red rose brought it home to you 
Blood red rose, tells me that you're true 
Red, red rose, blood-red rose 
Like a fire inside that grows, blood-red rose 

When you're hungry, I will fill you up 
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup 
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you 

When you're hungry, I will fill you up 
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup 
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you 

You know, I bleed every night you sleep 
'Cause I don't know if I'm in your dreams 
I want to be your everything... 

Diamond ring, wear it on your hand 
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man 
Diamond ring, diamond ring 
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring 
Darling, you're my everything, diamond ring 
Now, you've got me on your string... Diamond ring
