
I gave you my fingerprints
Left them all over you
Tangled up in your sheets
This heartache's the only proof
I gave you my fingerprints
Now just like you they're gone
The man invisible
I'll be him from now on

The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
I haven't seen them since
No matter who or what I touch
I leave no evidence
I gave you my fingerprints

I said I'd give you everything
But who thought you'd take it all
Does a promise really break
If nobody sees it fall
A hard rain can't wash away
The taste of your memory
Don't know what I would do
If you should stop haunting me

The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
Unbuttoning your dress
Those pretty pictures in my head
Are the only thing you left
I gave you my fingerprints

That shiny box I gave to you
Was all there was to me
All it was to you was just a faded memory

I gave her my fingerprints
Guilty or innocent
I have to ask myself
Would I do it all again
Would I

The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
I haven't seen them since
No matter who or what I touch
I leave no evidence
I gave you my finger prints
