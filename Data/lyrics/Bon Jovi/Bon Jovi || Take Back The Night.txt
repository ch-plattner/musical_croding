
These seven days and nights
Are always blending
This so called tragic life
So where's that happy ending
Stuck at the traffic light
It's just the same old song
I'm humming all the words
But I won't sing along
Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of giving in
Time to start living

We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night

Do you want to be
Another casualty
The one who stands his ground
When everybody leaves
It's time for taking sides
It's time to face the truth
Too late for turning back
So whatcha going to do
Listen
I need something different
There's no time for reason
I'm tired of bleeding

We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night

Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of dreaming
This time I'm screaming

We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night

Take back the night
We're going to take back the night
