
Oh baby oh baby yeah yeah yeah
Such a pleasure loving you
It's all mine

I feel better knowing you
Ooh you've got me thinking
It's better to give and take
I don't have to beg you too
You're so good to me
Carries me from day to day
I appreciate the things you do
Ooh but there's one thing I had to tell you boy
I dig your actions
But a lot of things you say

I listen to the things you say
Who you're calling me oh oh
I listen to the things you say
To me baby
In a poem on a card
Serenade my heart
I listen to the things you say
Who you're calling me oh oh
I listen to the things you say
To me baby
In a card of a song
Say my name please

Lovely letters come at times I know I don't deserve it
Any weather you'll come through
Ooh you've got me gleaming
I feel more than I worth
You're my treasure
I'll take you
Over anything
That's pleasing on this earth
I appreciate the things you do
But there's one thing I had to tell you boy
I dig your actions
But I love your words

[Chorus]

Every word that you say
Makes a day much brighter
Melody that you play
I hear by the way and the love is lighter
Speak to me

[Chorus]
