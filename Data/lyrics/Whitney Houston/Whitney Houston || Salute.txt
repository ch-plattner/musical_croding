
Ay, ay, ow 

Say you wanna walk away 
You ain't got nothing to say 
I salute you 
Go on out the door, 
Now, you take care 
No more tears to shed 
What, you expecting me to beg, 
Girl I'm not, I'm done 
So when you leave just close the door behind you, 

Cause, I'm feeling kind of hotter than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you, 
And I know just what to do, 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends 
I feel like going to a club and partying 

Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
and walk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay 

You think you know everything,and 
See you think that your sh don't stink, 
Well it do, yeah 
And when it comes to me, 
You don't have a clue 
It took me all these years, 
To realise that you don't belong here 
I can do better, 
You say I'll never do better 
Yeah right whatever 

I'm feeling kind of hotter than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you, 
And I know just what to do 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends 
I feel like going to a club (do some partying) 

Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
Iwalk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay 

So don't call or come back 
I did it for years, yeah 
Through all of the drama and the pain 
And all of the tears 
It's time to stop this rollercoaster, 
So that I can get off 
Let me start moving mountains, swimming seas, 
And climbing over walls 

I'm a soldier girl, in this world 
Stand alone, I can be strong 
I walked the miles, and made home 
It's good to know without you I made it 
Soldier, girl, in my world 
Took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta to say to you 
Salute, ay, ay 
Salute, ay, ay
