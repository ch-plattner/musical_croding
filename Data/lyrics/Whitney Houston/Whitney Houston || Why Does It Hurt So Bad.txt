[Chorus:]
Why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
Thought I was over you 
But I keep crying 
When I don't love you 
So why does it hurt so bad 
I thought I had let you go 
So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
It hurts so bad 
Oh it hurts so bad baby 

My life's been better 
Since the day I left you boy 
I must admit life's been kind to me 
I went and did the things I said I would boy 
I found someone who loves me for me 
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy 
My heart's never been more at ease 
And when I think of all the things you put me through 
Leaving you has been the best thing for me 

[Chorus:]
So why does it hurt so bad 
Why do I feel so sad 
I thought I was over you 
But I keep crying 
When I don't love you 
So why does it hurt so bad 
Baby I thought I had let you go 
So why does it hurt me so 
I gotta get you outta my head 
Hurts me so bad 
Hurts so (yeah you do) 
Hurts so (hurts me so) 
Hurts so bad (did you know) 
Hurts so (that it hurts me so) 
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh) 

"Never again" that's what I said to myself 
I never wanna feel kind of pain again boy 
Just when I think it's over 
Just when I think it's through 
I find myself right back in love with you 

[Chorus:]
So why does it hurt so bad oh baby 
Why do I feel so sad 
(thought I thought I) Thought I was over you 
I keep crying 
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy) 
(oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me) 
So why does it hurt so bad 
I thought I had let you go (thought I could let you go) 
You could 
Gotta get you outta my head 
Boy you hurt me so bad 
Hurts so (yeah you do) 
Hurts so (hurt me so) 
Hurts so bad (hurts so) 
Hurts so (sure you did) 
Hurts so (make me wanna make me wanna shoop shoop) 
Hurts so bad (hurt me so, gotta shoop now, hey hey hey hey) 
Hurts so bad (Hurts me so) 
Oh why, you hurt me so bad 
Bad... (how bout that?)
