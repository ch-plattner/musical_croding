Time can pass so slowly, when you feel so all alone 
Love can strike like lightning, when you find your heart a home 
I've seen it in the movies, read about it in a book 
I've never feel it, but your touch was all it took 

[Chorus:]
Take good care of my heart 
Take good care of my heart 
Baby you're the first to take it 
You're the only one who can break it 
I love you more than I should 
But it keeps me feeling so good 
I've waited for your love for ever 
You're the one to take good care of my heart 

Come and make you're magic, til you have me hypnotised 
If we get any closer, I'll be drowning in your eyes 
You're the one I needed most, when my love was on the line 
I'm so glad you gave me yours, when I gave you mine 

[Chorus]
