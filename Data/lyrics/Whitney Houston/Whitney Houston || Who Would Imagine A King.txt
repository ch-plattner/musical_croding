
Mommies and daddies always believe
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king?

A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king?

It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring

Who would imagine?
Who could imagine?
Who would imagine a king?

Mmm hmm
