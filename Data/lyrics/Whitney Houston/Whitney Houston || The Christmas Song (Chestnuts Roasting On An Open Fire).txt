
(Ooh well ooh Lord)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well)
Jack Frost nipping on your nose (mmm)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (well)
Help to make the season bright (mmm)
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

(Scats)
You know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas (scats)
Happy Chanukah
Happy Kwanzaa
Merry Christmas to
To all of you
Merry Christmas to everyone
