
I Believe In You and Me 
I Believe That we will be 
In love eternally 
Well as far as I can see 
You Will Always be the one 
For me (Oh yes, you will) 

And I believe in dreams again 
I believe that love will never end 
And like the river finds the sea 
I was lost, now I'm free 
Cuz I believe In you and me 

I will never leave your side 
I will never hurt your pride 
When all the chips are down, baby 
Then I will always be around 
Just to be right where you are 
My love, you know I love you, boy 

I will never leave you out 
I will always let you in, boy (mmm, oh baby) 
To places no-one's ever been, 
Deep inside, can't you see? 
That I believe in you and me 

Maybe I'm a fool 
To feel the way I do 
I will play the fool forever 
Just to be with you forever 

I believe in miracles 
And love is the miracle 
And yes, baby you're my dream come true 
I was lost, now I'm free, 
Oh, baby cuz i believe, i do believe, in you and me 
See, I was lost, now I'm free 
Cuz I believe in you and me.
