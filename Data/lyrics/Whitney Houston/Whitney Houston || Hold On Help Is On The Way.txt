
When you're down and in despair 
Don't be uneasy because he'll be there 
Say don't you worry, no don't you fret 
The Lord has never, never failed you yet 

[Chorus:]
So hold on, help is on the way 
Hold on, God is on his way 
Hey hold on he's on his way 
He told me to hold on 
He's on his way 
Hold on he's coming soon 
Pray, he'll be there 
Cmon now, yeah 

Now when it seems that you can't stand 
Just hold on to God's unchanging hand 
Yeah, weeping may, yes, endure for just one night, 
But joy will come in the morning light 

[Chorus:]
Hold on he's on his way 
Come on hold on 
See I've tried it and I know 
Help is on the way 
Hold on, hold on 
I'm begging cause I know 
He's on his way 

He may not come when you want him 
But he's right on time 
But he'll be right there (on time) 

Help is on the way 
Help is on the way 
Help is on the way yeah 
The word told me 
If I ask he's on his way 
I'm thankful cause I know he is 

Come on just say, help 
Come on just try, help 
Ask him for a little bit, help 
He'll give it to you right away, help 
Help, Believe he's on his way now, help 
Help, Know the help I know, help 
I've called him before, help 
He said his help on his way, help 
Help is on the way 
So glad to know hey... 
Woo
