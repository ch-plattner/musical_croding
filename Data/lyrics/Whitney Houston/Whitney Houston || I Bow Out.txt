
Tired of playing this game 
And I won’t play it no more 
And I won’t take it no more 
Through with being your fool 
And I won’t do it no more 
And I won’t, I won’t keep up this act 
Not for one minute 
I’m gonna pull, I’m gonna pull this curtain down 

[Chorus:]
This time I won’t play this game 
I made a vow to make a change 
And I bow out 
I won’t be hanging around, baby 
I decline to take the pain 
And I resign the masquerade 
And I bow out 
I won’t be staying around, baby 
I bow out 

Can’t go on with the show 
You’re just a stage I went through 
Now you’re just fading from view, yeah baby 
It’s time for a change of scene 
Guess I’ll be taking my leave 
I guess I won’t, I won’t stay in this play 
Not for one minute 
I’m gonna make, I’m gonna make my exit now 
Oh baby 

[Repeat Chorus]

When you’re left standing on that stage all alone 
Maybe you will realize 
You should of learned to treat me right 
And when this final act is finally through 
Maybe you’ll wish you’d been 
The kind of man you should have been 
Now watch me say goodbye 
And walk right out of your life 
Oh baby, all right babe 

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
