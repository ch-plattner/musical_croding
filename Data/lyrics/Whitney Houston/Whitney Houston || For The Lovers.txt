
To all the lovers in the place 
This song is for you 
To all the haters in the place 
Here's something at you 

It's been a long crazy week, all I want is a little time 
Rest my hands, cross my feet, let it go tonight 
Leave the stress at home, tell the driver go 
You ain't gonna kill my vibe, oh no 

I look at you, you look at me, you are ready now 
What I want, what I need is you and me on the floor 
I can feel your love when our bodies touch 
If anyone is feeling like me tonight 

Now throw your hands up for the next three minutes it's about the lovers 
(you know it, you know it) 
Baby stand up if you're single but you're looking for another 
(you know it, you know it) 
Ladies tell your men you love them (yeah...) 
Fellows tell your girl you love her (yeah...) 
So throw your hands up for the next three minutes it's about the lovers 

Thinking about the ones that are looking down on you and me 
Lovers in together now, now I'm completely free 
Life is way too short, you might as well get yours 
Lord knows I'm doing it 

If your lover ain't around 
that don't mean you can't get down 
(you know it, you know it) 
And if you came her all alone 
Find someone and hold them close 
(you know it, you know it) 

So throw your hands up 
Baby let me see you stand up 
And if you're single it don't matter 
'cause this song is for everyone who believes in love
