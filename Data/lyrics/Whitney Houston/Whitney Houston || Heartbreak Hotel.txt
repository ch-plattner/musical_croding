
This is the heartbreak hotel [9x]
You said that you'd be here by nine 
And said you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why you do this to me

[Chorus 1 (sung by Faith Evans)]

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is hat I have to say: 
All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you play with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you been doing wrong 
You played me all along. 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me. 
How could you do it to me?

[Chorus 2 (sung by Kelly Price)]

This is the heartbreak hotel [9x]
Chorus and ad lib
I aint goin to take it no more [4x]
[Kelly Price] Everthing you said was a lie 
Don't lie to me [fade out]
