
I love the the Lord, he heard my cry 
And pitied every groan, long as I, I live 
And troubles rise, I hasten to his throne 

[Chorus:]
Oh, I love the Lord 
I sure do, surely do love the Lord 
He heard, he heard my cry 
And pitied every groan, yes he did 
Every groan 
Long as I live, long as I, I live 
And troubles rise, troubles rise 
I hasten to to to to to 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne 
I'll hasten to his throne hold on hold on 
Tears are streaming down my eyes 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne 

Yes I will, I'll run 
I know I can go to his throne 
I know I can go, I know I can go 
I'll hasten, I'm gonna run 
I know I can go, I know I can go 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne 

See I can run, Lord you know I will 
When there is nowhere to go I know I can go to you 
I know I can run to you oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
