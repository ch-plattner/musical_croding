
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

Everybody's been so uptight
And forgetting to live the life
Let all the problems get them down
Till they make you wanna shout

See everybody's been down in luck
Now finally things are looking up
The sun is chased all the rain away
No more obstacles in our away

It's time to celebrate (come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (that's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (because it's so right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)

There is oh so many of us (that underestimate the power of love)
So much hate going round and I've had enough
I've invited you for the love
Though we been going through changes
Just trying to make it from day to day
Tonight don't you worry about a thing
Just cast your cares away

It's time to celebrate (come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (it is what I want)
I wanna celebrate (it's time to celebrate)
I celebrate you, I celebrate you

It's time to celebrate (come on, come on)
Come on and celebrate (don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (tonight everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, I celebrate you

I'm gonna give you a reason
Why you should clap your hands and jump for joy
There's something we can believe in
Now that the rain is gone we're gonna dance in o a rainbow

It's time to celebrate (come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (time to celebrate)
I wanna celebrate (because it's so right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you)
Celebrate me, celebrate me

It's time to celebrate (time to bring you and me)
Come on and celebrate (don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (tonight everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, you celebrate me

It's time to celebrate
Come on and celebrate
I wanna celebrate
I celebrate you, you celebrate me

It's time to celebrate
Come on and celebrate
I wanna celebrate
I celebrate you, you celebrate me

It's time to celebrate
Come on and celebrate
I wanna celebrate
I celebrate you, you celebrate me
