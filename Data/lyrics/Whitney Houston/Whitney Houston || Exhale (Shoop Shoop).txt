
Everyone falls in love sometime 
Sometimes it's wrong 
And sometimes it's right 
For every win 
Someone must fail 
But there comes a point when 
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say) 

[Chorus:]
Shoop, Shoop, Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (yeah) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
(All you got to say is shoo be doop) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
Shoo Be Doo 

Sometimes you'll laugh 
Sometimes you'll cry 
Life never tells us 
The when's or why's 
When you've got friends to wish you well 
You'll find a point when 
You wille exhale (yeah, yeah, say) 

[Chorus:]
Shoop, Shoop, Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (shoo shoo shoo huh) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Sho0 be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoop say shoo be say shoo be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (say shoo-hoo say sho) 
Shoo Be Doo (be doo oh) 

Hearts are often broken 
When there are words unspoken 
In your soul there's 
Answers to your prayers 
If you're searching for 
A place you know 
A familiar face 
Somewhere to go 
You should look inside yourself 
You're halfway there 

[Repeat Verse 2]

[Chorus:]
Shoop, Shoop, Shoop (Shoo Be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo-hoo-hoo be) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop doop doop hoo hoo hoo) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (do do shoo be shoo be feels alright) 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (You can say oh) 
Shoo Be Doo
