
I believe in roses, 
But only from the heart
And if it's not sincere baby, 
Then I don't want no part

I believe in one love baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, that's not the way I see

If you believed in me, you wouldn't mess around
It's not like I don't know you been with every girl in town

You got a lot of nerve to think, I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it, I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love
I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you, anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses
I don't want to be your Mrs.
I don't want you, anymore

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong your doin', just might come back on you

I believe in phone calls, when your not by my side
Especially when it's lonely, in the middle of the night

If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord have mercy on you, chivalry is dead

You got a lot of nerve to think, to think that I'm still down
While you've taken me for granted, boy I'm thru, I'm outta town

[Chorus]

So baby, (so baby)
You can kiss this girl goodbye
I'm through with ya
Movin'on with my life
No more pain, no more fears
I'm movin' on
I'm keepin' on
I'm through with all the fears

Your kinda love 
Your kinda trust 
I don't want you, don't need you,
can't have you
Your kinda kisses
To be your Mrs.
I don't want you

[Chorus]
