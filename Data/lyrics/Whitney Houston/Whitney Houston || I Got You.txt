When your love is strong and it comes from the heart 
Ain't no man strong enough, ain't no time long enough to tear it apart 
And that's what we had, believe it or not 
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top 

So I won't cry 'cause you're going away 
'cause the chemistry we've got it, don't fade 
I won't be wishing for better days 
'cause deep inside I know our love stays the same 

You gotta know 
No matter where you are (you got me) 
Baby near or far (you got me) 
Our love will never fade (you got me) 
So let me hear you say it 
baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there 
Baby I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there 
'cause I got you baby 

I never lie 
'cause you are the reason that my heart is beating, that I am alive 
Before you go, thinking that I can be replaced, no 
I got you waiting for the rest of my life 

I'll hold you up, when you just can't stand 
I'll make you cry, when you think that you can't 
By my side forever, baby that's the plan 
I'll be your everything, I'll be your everything 

Say you want me, I want you baby 
Say you love me, I need you baby 
I got you baby, you got me 
I'll be there for you 
I love you baby, I love you darling
