O holy night.
The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth. (Oh yes it is now.)
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O o night when Christ was born
O night
O holy, holy night
O night divine

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O o night when Christ was born
O night
O night
O holy night
O night divine
Mmm
