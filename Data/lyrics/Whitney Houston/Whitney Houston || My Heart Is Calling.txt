Who would've thought of it 
That I might feel like this 
Some kind of wonderful 
There's nothing quite comparable 

The thing about it is 
It's oh so innocent 
I wasn't looking for 
It came knockin' at my door 

I'm trying to do things right 
But I'm about to lose this fight 
'Cause spending time with you 
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth 

And every day with you 
I swear it brings me closer 
to my only reservationis you 
My sweet temptation, baby. 

Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you 
Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you 

Who could imagine it 
I found my happiness 
In someone I barely know 
And I like to take it slow 

But you're so diferent, boy 
You're breaking all my rules 
What is it in your smile 
that makes me feel the way I do 

I'm trying to live my life 
And I'm trying to live it right 
If I desire you 
It ain't because I'm trying to 

Boy, everyday with you 
I swear it brings me closer to 
My only reservation is you, 
My sweet temptation, baby 

[chorus]

I've given it consideration (uh huh) 
And it all adds up to you 
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby 
I've given it alot of thought (uh huh) 
And it all ends up on you 
My sweet temptation 
God knows I'm falling for you 

[chorus]

Is is in your smile, boy 
Is it touch, baby 
I don't know why .....
