
Huh, yeah, woo, hey yeah, huh
Ooh yeah, uh huh, yeah

I want to dance

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

[Chorus 2x:]
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus 2x]

Somebody who somebody who.... somebody who loves me,
Somebody who somebody who... to hold me in his arms.
I need a man who'll take a chance,
On a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls,
My lonely heart calls.

[Chorus 2x]

Uh-Huh
(Dance)
Common, baby
(Dance)
Woo, yeah
(Dance)
Now get with this, hahaha
Whoa, oh, oh

Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby?
Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me boy?
Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby?

With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?
(Dance)
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?
(Dance)
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance...(Dance)
Uh-huh
With somebody who loves me
