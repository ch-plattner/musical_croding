
All at once, 
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that 
Your not coming back 
And it finally hit me all at once 
All at once, 
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell, 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 

[Chorus:]
Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely see 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it hurts me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once,
I looked around and found that you were with another love 
In someone else's arms,
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once 
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once 

[chorus]
