
I hope that you realize baby, just what you mean to me 
Hey you where I run for cover, your loving shelter for me 
And when I find myself needing some lifting up 
One night with you and that always is enough 
Hey you make being in love, a true rare affair 
So take me I'm your prisoner 

[Chorus:]
Will you sentence me to be your lover for life 
Your lover for life 
Will you sentence me, I want to be you lover for life 
Your lover for life 

I just want to hear you say 
You'll be my lover, lover for life 
Capture, there's no getaway 
You're my lover, my lover for life 

Under your spell or under my own power 
It really doesn't matter to me 
See I fell in love the first time I saw you 
And have been falling in love ever since 

You heard my testimony, you've seen my evidence 
Hey, it's a crime of passion, in every sense 
And justice won't be served, till you stay here in my world 
Take me I'm your prisoner 

[chorus]
