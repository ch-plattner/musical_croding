It all began 
We were all in love 
Then came the friends 
Telling you when your time for me 
Was good enough 
I constantly had to compete 
With you crew and their schemes 
Remembering 
Back in the day I used to mean everything
If we could just get it back 
(To the way it used to be) 
My only wish would be that 
(Nothing would change with you and me)
I remember how it was 
(And I know that for a fact) 
We were oh so deep in love 
(If we could just get it back)
Now tell me why 
All of them nights 
You had so much to go 
When you said bye 
Sometimes I tried, I tried 
To make you choose 
Now tell me how you can allow
You boys to control the time 
We shared it was unfair 
But now it's time for you to know 
(Now if I told you) 
That I'm moving on 
(Boy what would you do) 
Things just ain't the same 
(We were supposed to) 
Conquer everything, yeah 
(Boy let me tell you)
You're got to make a change
If we could just get it back 
(To the way it used to be) 
My only wish would be that 
(Nothing would change with you and me) 
I remember how it was 
(And I know that for a fact) 
We were oh so deep in love 
(If we could just get it back)
If we could just get it back 
(To the way it used to be) 
My only wish would be that 
(Nothing would change with you and me) 
I remember how it was 
(And I know that for a fact) 
We were oh so deep in love 
(If we could just get it back)
(Do you rememebr) 
The way you used to love 
You would kiss and hug me 
(I rememebr) 
U haven't lately 
(Do you remember) 
All the things you gave me 
Everywhere you'd take me 
(Can't you see that) 
I really really need you back
If we could just get it back 
(To the way it used to be) 
My only wish would be that 
(Nothing would change with you and me) 
I remember how it was 
(And I know that for a fact) 
We were oh so deep in love 
(If we could just get it back)
