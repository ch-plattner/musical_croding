
Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you 
Loving you 
Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight 
And a song, soft and long 
Well, you'd like to think 
We're alone with a love unlike no other 
Sad to see, a new horizon slowly coming into view 

[Chorus:]
I want to be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me 
My loving me, yeah 
Smoother then a gentle breeze 
Flowing from my mind with ease 
Soft as can be 
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby 
Love to be
Riding the waves of love enchanted with your touch 
It seems to me
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

[Chorus]

Paradise, I hafta think, can't feel as secure again 
You're the key 
And this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Confusing words to try and say what I feel 
Yeah, your love is real 
I might as well, sign my name on a card that's been saying better
See, time will tell 
Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do 

[Chorus]
