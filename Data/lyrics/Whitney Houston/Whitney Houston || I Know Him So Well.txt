
Nothing is so good it lasts eternally 
Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back, I could have done it differently 
Won a few more moments, who can tell? 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know, I know him well 

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide 
Looking back, I could have played it differently 
Learned about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 

Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine) 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 

Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart 

Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
It took some to understand him 
Hoo ooh I know him so well
