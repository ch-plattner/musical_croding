
Did you really think that 
I would really take you back 
Let you back in my heart one more time 
Ohh. No. No. 
Did you think that I'd still care 
That there'd be more feeling there 
Did you think you could walk back in my life. 
So you found you miss the love you threw away. 
Baby but you found it out too late. Too Late. 

[Chorus:]
And so now you know the way it feels to cry 
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two. 
Baby I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best. 
I learned from you. 
Oh baby now. 
I learned from you 
I remember cold nights 
Tears I though would never dry 
How you shattered my world 
With your goodbye.Your goodbye baby 
Would've sold my soul then. 
Just to have you back again 
Now you're the last thing on my mind. 
Now you say your sorry and 
You've changed your ways 
Sorry but you changed you ways too late. 

[Chorus]

So when all you've got are sleepless nights 
When those tears are clouding up your eyes 
Just remember it was you who said goodbye 
Who said goodbye. 

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
