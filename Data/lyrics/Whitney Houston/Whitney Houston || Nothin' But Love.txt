
Here I sit by my window thinking about all the things that I've been through 
There were times where I never thought I get to where I got to 
Had some angels to guide me, someone to ? lay on all my love 
Now this is my chance to say ain't go nothin but love 

For my family that raised me (shout out, shout out) 
And my teacher that done praised me (shout out, shout out) 
To anyone who tried to hate on me (shout out, shout out) 
Even the one's who tried to break me, even the one's who tried to take me down 

There've been haters since this world been going 'round 
(nothin but love, nothin but love) 
Why they take a thing and trying to crush them down 
(nothin but love, nothin but love) 
I ain't even trying to hold on to that now 
(nothin but love, nothin but love) 
Ain't got nothin but love for you 
(nothin but love, nothin but love) 

I could hold on to pain but that ain't what my life's about 
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out 
I got love for my self, ain't gonna regret anything I've done 
I just wanna sing my song, ain't got nothin but love 

For all the players on the street (shout out, shout out) 
To all my ? doing their own thing (keep on, keep strong) 
To all my exes that done wrong me, stepped on me, can't hold me down 

To all the givers and the takers 
To my crew from way back when 
To the cold wars and the stares 
And the ones that I ain't met 
For my self for sticking with me 
For the one's I miss from up above 
Anyone who's ever been a part of me 
Ain't got nothin but love
