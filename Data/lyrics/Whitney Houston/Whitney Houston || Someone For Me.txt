(Someone for me) 
(Someone for me) 
I'm here alone on a Friday night 
Waiting here beside the phone 
The TV, radio, and me 
Really ain't been getting along 
I wish that I could find a way 
To party to the break of day 
And there I'd be sure to meet 
The guy that would be special to me 
Then momma comes and asks me 
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone 
Why not go out and have some fun 
It's the only way I'll ever 
Find someone for me 
While I am young and seventeen 

[Chorus:]
Someone for me (someone for me) 
I've got to find someone 
Someone (someone for me) 
I've got to find someone 

Now there's a party down at Angie's house 
With people packed against the walls 
I'm sitting in a corner here 
Trying to make sense of it all 
And when I least expect it 
Meeting a guy I see in my dreams 
Here he is walking up to me 
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him 
I think I found someone for me 

[Chorus]
I need somebody for me 
I need somebody for me, someone 
And so I'm finding out that 
Dreams you believe in, can come to be 
And now I'm looking up to find that joy 
And happiness can come to you and me 
I actually found someone for me 

[Chorus]
