There's a chance that maybe in this life I'll find
True love and peace of mind
There's a chance that maybe I can reach my goal
And soar to the other side
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so...

[CHORUS:]
I'm taking a chance on loving you
No matter the price i'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you 
They tell me I'm crazy

There's a chance that maybe once I could be wrong
But wrong never felt so right
There's a chance that maybe I'm risking much too soon
But our hearts just fell in tune

Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so...

[chorus]

I don't know much about you, but I know I can't live without you
I am telling all my friends goodbye
My friends can't understand but, 
I know I've got to try,
Here's my reason why,
I'm in love, that's all I know

[chorus]
