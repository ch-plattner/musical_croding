You that I have feelings for you 
Ansd would it be so wrong to say 
What's on my mind 
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time 
What I feel inside for you has changed 
But I'd give up on love, if I thought 
That it was untrue for you

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

I know that we were just friends 
But what if I decide to bring somethings in 
I hope it won't offend the trust 
We have cause I don't want this to end
I you think that we'll lose what we have 
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same 
(I'd rather stay the same) 
Cause I don't wanna choose 
Between two of the most precious things to me 
(tell me)

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

If we take this chance and extend 
To each other romance 
I hope it would be 
The right thing for you and me

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

Would you be there for me 
Could you dare to hold me 
Will my feelings leave me 
Lonely if I told you
