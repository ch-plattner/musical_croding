Oh he's all 
He's all over me 
He's keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
He's keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
The Lord is keeping me alive 
I know he's 
He's keeping me alive 

[Chorus:]
He's all over me 
He's all in my mind right now 
And he's keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
Yes he is 
I know the Lord he is 
He's keeping me alive 
Oh, yes he is, yeah 

He's in my hands 
He's in my feet 
I can hardly keep my seat 
He's in my spirit and my soul 
I will never grow old 
He's in my heart 
He's in my mind 
I am glad am I 
He's all over me 
The Lord is keeping me alive 
I know he is keeping me alive 
He's keeping me alive 

Like the Hebrew boys 
Thrown in the fiery furnace 
See everybody thought it was over for them 
But the Lord brought them out on time 
He's the firm foundation 
The God of all creation 
There's nothing that he won't do for you 
You can trust him, he'll see you through 

[Repeat Chorus]

I want to tell you again 
Like the Hebrew boys 
They were thrown in the fiery furnace 
Everybody thought it was over for them 
But the Lord brought them out on time 
He's the firm foundation 
The God of all creation 
There's nothing that he won't do for you 
If you trust him he'll see you through 

[Chorus:]
He's all over me 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
The boy 
He's all over me 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
And he'd keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
All over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
My Lord is keeping me alive 
I know the Lord is keeping me alive 
I know he is keeping me alive 

He's in my hands and in my feet 
I can hardly keep my seat 
He's in my spirit and my soul 
I will never ever grow old 
He's in my heart and in my mind 
I'm glad he's mine 
He's on the right on the left 
Over me over me 
On the front and the back 
On the right on the left 
Over me over me 
On the front and the back 
On the right on the left 
Yeah yeah 

[Chorus:]
He's all over me 
He is keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
He's all over me 
And he's keeping me alive 
My Lord is keeping me alive 
He's all over me 
I'm so glad that he is 
And he's keeping me alive 
He's keeping me alive 
I know he is 
I know the Lord is keeping me 
He's keeping me alive
