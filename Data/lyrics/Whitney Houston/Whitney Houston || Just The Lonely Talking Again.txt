It's the second tine around
For you and I, boy
And believe me it's confusing me...
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and, "all's forgiven,"
But somethin' tells me I'm headed for heartbreak....
So darlin', please, I'm prayin' that 
This time it will be different 
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize...

[Chorus:]
Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again.....

Now, the time before
When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking.....
Lonely nights filled with misery

So baby, please, please tell me now
That when I fulfill your needs
You won't up and leave me,
Even though you know I'll let you come back.... 
Tell me

[Chorus]
