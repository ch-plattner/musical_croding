The stars must be aligned tonight
I believe this has to have a meaning
Lightening had to strike tonight
'Cause the two of us are finally meeting

In this place, at this time
And I feel safe when I look in your eyes
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay but I gotta go

So I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone
I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get home

That's the way it goes in life
You get busy when you just don't wanna
There's never enough time day or night
You have to make it so baby

I'm gonna make a way to connect
'Cause your face is one I can't forget
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay but I gotta go

So I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone
I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get home

Destiny, I believe in it
Meant to be, don't you see it's possible
That for this kind of magic anything can happen
And if you wanna know then stay by the phone
Just stay by the phone

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay but I gotta go

So I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone
I'mma call you tonight
I will baby, just as soon as I get home
