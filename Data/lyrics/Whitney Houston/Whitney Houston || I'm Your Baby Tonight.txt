From the moment I saw you 
I went outta my mind 
Though I never believed in, love at first sight 
But you got a magic 
That I just can't explain 
Well you got a, you got a way that you make me feel 
I can do, I can do anything for you baby 
I'll be down for you baby 
Lay all my cards out tonight 
Just call on me baby 
I'll be there in a hurry 
It's your move, so baby 
Baby decide!

[Chorus:]
Whatever you want from me 
I'm givin' you everything 
I'm your baby tonight 
You've given me ecstasy 
You are my fantasy 
I'm your baby tonight 

From the second you touched me
I was ready to die 
I've never been fatal, you're my first time 
I feel like an angel, who just started to fly 
Well you got a, you got a way that you make me 
Feel I can, feel I can, do anything for you baby 
I will fly for you baby, hold on and enjoy the ride 
I'm not in no hurry, We can fly all night baby 
It's your move, now baby
Baby let's fly!

[chorus]

Whatever I do boy
It's all about you baby 
And ain't the truth boy
I'm helplessly in love with you 
What else can I do boy
But be there for you baby 
You got a, you got a way that you make a me 
Feel I can, feel I can do any, do anything 

[chorus]

Looks like I'm fatal, It's all on the table 
And baby you hold the cards, You got the magic 
And I've got to have it, I don't want the pieces 
I want every single part, I'll be your angel 
I'm ready and able, Whatever you want is fine 
Whenever you're ready, just call on your lady 
And I'll be your baby tonight 

[chorus]
