
In a world where dreams are few
You've got me baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes me feel brand new

Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul baby, make you doubt
That's you'll never find the one that's true

All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I wanna know
And nothin's gonna stop me cuz'

[Chorus]

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feelin' the rhythm
As we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you

Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothin' has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me cuz'

[Chorus]

When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you

[Chorus]
