How could I throw away a miracle?
How could I face another day?
It's all of my doing, I made a choice 
And today, I pay 
My heart is full of pain 

How could you understand, the way I feel? 
How could you relate to so much pain? 
Seems as though nothing can comfort me 
So today, I pray 
That someone should listen, for...

[Chorus:]
Nothing should matter 
Not when love grows inside you 
The choice is yours 
There's a miracle in store...
Nothing should matter 
Not when love grows inside you 
A voice of love is crying out 
Don't throw love away 
There's a miracle in store...

How could I let go of a miracle? 
Nothing cold ever take its place 
Thought I was looking, out for myself 
Now it seems the pain 
Is all that I have gained 
I wonder if I could be your miracle 
I wonder if I could spare you pain 
Seems as though nothing will comfort me 
Lord, less today, I pray 
That you should come listen 

[chorus]

Don't ever throw away your miracle 
Don't let it slip away 
Nothing should matter 

[chorus]
