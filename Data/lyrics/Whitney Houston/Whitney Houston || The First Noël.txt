The first Noël, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East, beyond them far; 
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night. 
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel.

Jesus Christ is
Born is the King of Israel. [2x]

Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel.

Jesus
The first Noël

Born is the King of
King of
Oh yeah yeah
Oh Christ is born
Ooh hallelujah hey
He is born
Oh Christ the King is born
