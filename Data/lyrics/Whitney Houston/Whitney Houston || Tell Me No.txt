Reaching for my dreams
And you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my action
But I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way
I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

[Chorus:]
And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I sink my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
Come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

Every step I take you're right there trying to block my next move
If you're making me feel bad, then tell me then do you feel good
I'm just human I know what I'm doing
That's what my heart tells me I should
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

[Chorus]

No no no no no no no
You motivates me more and more
And I think it's time that you know
Giving me something to afford
And I can't wait for the day
I can rock things in your place
I ain't gonna stop til I'm done
I reach the top I'm the No.1
For everytime you try and tell me no
Oh you makes me keep on keep it all

[Chorus x2]
