
Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so 
Jesus loves me this I know 
For the Bible tells me so 
Little ones to him belong 
They are weak but he is strong 

Yes Jesus loves me 
Oh, yes Jesus loves me 
Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so 

Pressing on the up away 
Always guide me Lord I pray 
Undeserving, and stubbornly never fail to love me still 

Yes Jesus loves me 
Oh yes Jesus loves me 
Oh yes Jesus loves me, for the Bible tells me so 
Yes Jesus loves me, love 
Oh yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so 
For the Bible tells me so 

(Feels so good to know) that I'm never alone 
See, sometimes I'm lonely but never alone 
For the Bible tells, for the Bible tells 
For the Bible tells me so 

See I know that he loves me 
Whether I'm right, whether I'm wrong
