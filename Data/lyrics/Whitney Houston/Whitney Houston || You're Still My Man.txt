
On the day that you left me 
ou said you had no regrets 
There's a bond between us 
That hasn't been broken yet 
And the feelings between us 
Will never diappear 
How can you be far away
When your spirits here

[Chorus]
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

And the seasons of our love 
Will always change I know
Maybe that's the reason 
You felt you had to go
But soon you'll be missing me
Darling, I know you well 
There's a magic we share together
And no one can break that spell

[Chorus]

I'll wait for you
The thought that keeps me going each day
Is I believe you still love me
I love you more than words can say

[Chorus-Repeat]
