There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of 
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above 
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love

[Chorus:]
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 
How will I know 
How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 
How will I know 
How will I know if he really loves me 
I say a prayer with every heart beat 
I fall in love whenever we meet 
I'm asking you what you know about these things 
How will I know if he's thinking of me 
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 
Falling in love is all bitter sweet 
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now 
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love 

[chorus]

If he loves me, if he loves me not [X3]

[chorus]
