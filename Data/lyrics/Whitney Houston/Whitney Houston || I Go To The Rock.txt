
Where do I go? 
When there's nobody else to turn to 
Who do I talk to? 
When nobody wants to listen 
Who do I lean on? Oh 
When there is no foundation stable 
I go to the rock 
I know he is able, I go to the rock 

[Chorus:]
I go to the rock of my salvation 
I go to the stone that the builders rejected 
I run to the mountain 
And the mountain he stands by me 
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand 
On Christ the solid rock I stand 
When I need a shelter I go to the rock 

Where do I go, where do I go 
When the storms of life are threatening 
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow 
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation 
Go to the rock, I know he is able 
I go to the rock 

[Repeat Chorus (2X)]

I go the rock when I need a friend 
I can go to the rock 
I go to the rock when I need a shelter 
You can go to the rock 
You can go to the rock 
You can go to the rock 
I can go 
I go to the rock 
I can go to the rock 
I can go to the rock 
I can go, I can go to the rock 
I can go when I need some shelter 
When I need a friend 
I can go 

And when the Earth around me is sinking sand 
On Christ the solid rock I stand I can stand 
When I need a friend 
I go to the rock 
I can go to the rock 
Hey hey hey oh yeah
