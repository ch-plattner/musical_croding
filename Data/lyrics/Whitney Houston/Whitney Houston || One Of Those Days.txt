[Ad-libs] Ohh. This is just for me.
[Laughs]
Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
It's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do something special for me

See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And my real ladies know what I'm talking about

[Sing] Oooooooh, baby baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now. Oooooooh, baby baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you're out to see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

Tonight, it's all about me
Just wanna set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down... sing

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs at the end, singing hello... hello... (friendly)]
I need one of those days
you don't know what...
warm and beautiful
[Laughs again.]
