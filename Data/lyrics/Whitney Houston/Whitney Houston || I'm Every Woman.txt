Whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby,
I do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby,
I do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z...
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa (oh) whoa (oh) whoa

I can cast a spell
Secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew,
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel
Danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear
Yeah oh

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby,
I do it naturally
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I can set your needs
Like rain unto the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I got it, I got it, I got it, got it, baby, baby

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby,
I do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z...
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I ain't braggin'
'Cause I'm the one
Just ask me
Oh, it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Ah

I'm every woman [4x]

I'm every woman [4x]

I'm every woman (chaka)
I'm every woman (chaka)
I'm every woman (ha, ha, ha)
I'm every woman (my girl)
