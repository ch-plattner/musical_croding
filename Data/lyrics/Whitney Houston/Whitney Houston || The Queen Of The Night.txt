I've got the stuff that you want 
I've got the thing that you need 
I've got more than enough 
to make you drop to your knees 
'Cause I'm the queen of the night 
The queen of the night 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Yeah 

Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right 
I've got the feeling & I'm willing tonight

What can I say? 
Well I'm just that way 
Hey, ey

And turn it up for you, baby 

I've got the stuff that you want

'Cause I'm the queen of the night
