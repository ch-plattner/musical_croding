Friday night you and your boys went out to eat 
Then they hung out 
But you came home around three 
If six of y'all went out 
Then four of you were really cheap 
Cause only two of you had dinner 
I found your credit card receipt 

[Chorus 1]
It's not right 
But it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Pack your bags up and leave 
Don't you dare come running back to me 
It's not right 
But it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Close the door behind you 
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone 
Than unhappy 

I'll pack your bags 
So you can leave town for a week 
The phone rings 
And then you look at me 
You said it was one of your friends 
Down on 54th St. 
So why did 213 
Show up on your Caller I.D. 

[Chorus 2]
I've been through all of this before 
So how could you think 
That I would stand around 
And take some more 
Things are gonna change 
That's why you have to leave 
So don't turn around to see my face 
There's no more fears and tears 
For you to see 

Was it really worth you going out like that 
See I'm moving on 
And I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time 
I thought I had somebody down for me 
It turns out 
You were making a fool of mee 

[Chorus1 (5x until fade)]
