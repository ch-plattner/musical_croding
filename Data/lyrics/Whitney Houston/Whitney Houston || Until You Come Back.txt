
I lost my heart 
A long time ago 
You make me feel 
Like no one had before 
Boy you make me love you 
Then you walked out the door 
Well I will not rest 
Until the say I am forever yours

And boy I won't stop at nothing 
I won't give you up and 
You've gotta feel sometthing I know 
I will not love again 
Until you come back 
Come back to my arms 
Till you come back to me baby 
Until you come back (to me)

Don't care how long 
It's not important to me 
Don't care how far 
Love's never too far for me 
I just might be crazy 
When it comes to my heart 
But I can not rest 
Until the day we're no longer apart

And boy I won't stop at nothing 
I won't get you up and 
You've gotta feel sometimes I know 
I will not love again 
Until you come back 
Come back to my arms 
Till you come back to me baby 
Until you come back (to me)

Nobody plays with my heart 
U can't walk away from it all 
U can run but your heart cannot hide 
Cause it knows you belong in my life

And boy I won't stop at nothing 
I won't get you up and 
You've gotta feel sometimes I know 
I will not love again 
Until you come back 
Come back to my arms 
Till you come back to me baby 
Until you come back (to me)
