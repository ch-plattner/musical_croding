
I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Gonna take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love
It's good to be lost in the afterglow
All I'm dreaming of
I just can't let the feeling go

After we make love
I feel I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters here andnow

Now the world is full of wonder
You've turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you've put me under
Just one kiss can take my breath away

[Chorus]

All the lonely days and nights
Were well wroth going through
I'm so glad I didn't give my heart away
So I could give it all to you

[Chorus]
