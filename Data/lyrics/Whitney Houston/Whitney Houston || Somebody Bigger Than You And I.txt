
Somebody bigger than the Earth is round 
Bigger than the saddest frown 
Bigger than the brightest smile 
And longer than the longest mile 

Somebody bigger than the biggest fight 
And darker than the darkest night 
Bigger than the biggest gun 
Cause he's the only shining sun cmon 

Who made the mountains 
Who made the trees 
Who made the rivers that flow out to the seas 
And who hung the moon in the starry, starry, starry sky 

[Chorus:]
Somebody bigger 
I know I know he's bigger than you and I 
My God is bigger 
Somebody bigger 
He's bigger, he's bigger than you 
He's bigger than you 
My God is, my God is oh 

Now who made the flowers bloom in the spring, yeah 
And who writes the songs for the robins to sing uh 
And who sends the rain when the Earth is dry 
I know, I know, I know 
Somebody bigger yeah 
Than you and I 
Somebody bigger than you and I 
Bigger than you and I 

He lights the way when road is alone 
Keeps me company with love to guide you 
He walks beside you just like he walks with me 

When I am weary, and filled with despair 
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there 
And who gives me faith 
I will never, never, never, never, never doubt 
Somebody bigger yeah 
Somebody bigger than me and you 
Bigger than you and I 
Somebody bigger 
My Lord is bigger than you 
Bigger than you and I 

He lights the way when the road is long 
Keeps you company with love to guide you 
He walks beside you just like he walks with me 

Somebody bigger than you and I 
Bigger than the open sky 
Bigger than the tallest tree 
Bigger than the deepest sea 
Somebody deeper than the desert sands 
Bigger than the tallest man 
And phatter than the phattest phat 
Bigger than the Shaq attack 

[Repeat Chorus]
