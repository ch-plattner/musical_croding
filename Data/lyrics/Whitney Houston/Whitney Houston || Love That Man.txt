
Ah, ah, ah
Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
He'd be working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a treat
So it might be love and sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
May not be perfect
But he's all the man I need
He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling, ah
And whenever we're together
I know where I belong

[chorus:]
It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

Things they ain't the way they used to be
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and stand together ooh
(Let's stay that way forever)

Never give in to a fight
Just trying work it out
Never give up on him
That's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings
And remember
All the things he's done for you

[Repeat Chorus]

You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love
That everlasting feeling can never be too much
Somebody loves you heart and soul
Hold on, don't stop
And never let him go

[Repeat Chorus]
