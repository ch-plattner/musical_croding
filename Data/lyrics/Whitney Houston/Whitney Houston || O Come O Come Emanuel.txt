
O come o come Emanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel

(Bumm, bumm, bumm, bumm)
Ah well, ooh
(Bumm, bumm, bumm)
Ooh

O come, Desire of nations, bind
Bind as one the hearts of all mankind
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease
And be Thyself our King of peace

(Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(O Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(O Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(O Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)
Emanuel shall
(Shall come)

He's gonna come o Israel
(Shall come)
Don't you worry, God's gonna be there
(Emanuel shall come)
Emanuel, He's gonna come
O Israel
Ooh yeah
