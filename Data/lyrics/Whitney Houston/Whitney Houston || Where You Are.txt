
I saw the news this morning
Saw your face accross the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine

[Chorus]

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end - 
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Today I did some shopping 
Just had to clear my mind again
(I can't stop thinkin' 'bout cha)
I hopped into a taxi, seemed...
In a moment I was home... home again

[chorus]

Tossing and turning in my sleep 
I can't make it without you, now
I'm gonna take the next plane out 
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or how far
Or then if you're a star
I know I should be there where you are

[chorus]
