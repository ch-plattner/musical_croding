
My love
Some girl just wanna spend guys money
Live their lives chasing the milk or honey
Silver lives are their fantasy
But you're lucky cause that ain't me

Most girls think guys are all the same
Not you so I can take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

[Chorus:]
See my love is like a open sky
See my heart is like the river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, My love, My)

Some think that love is just a word
Because of all the things they've heard
They think they're gotta close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark
But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can
That's why I'm here faithfully
Cause you'll do the same for me

[Chorus]

You gotta go through
The fire (the pain)
The rain (the joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain
(Never give in)
Give in
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
We can try but it will never never break my love

Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love

[Chorus]
