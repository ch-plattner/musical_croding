Who's to say it's easy
Sometimes life's not fair
I've heard some say just knock the door will open
And when it does you'll find love standing there

And if it's true I'm knockin'
Come open up the door
My heart's been right here waiting
For someone to adore

Well if it's true I'm knockin'
Come open up the door
My heart's been right here waiting
For someone to adore
Say if it's true

In sight we have to choices
And it's told to me to do or die
And every word he speaks makes me certain 
Beyond the door's life's reason why

[Chorus]
(Knock the door will open)
The door will open
(Look and you will find it)
Look and you will find it
For certain it's true for me and for you
When love comes and knocks
Here's the right thing to do

[Chorus]

Ask me what I want
Peace of mind
Ask me what I don't 
Waste of time
Tell me that it's true 
And you will find me knockin'
