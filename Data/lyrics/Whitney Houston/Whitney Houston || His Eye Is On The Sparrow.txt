
Why should I feel discouraged, 
Why should the shadows come, 
Why should my heart be lonely, 
And long for heaven, heaven and home, 
When, when Jesus is my portion, 
My constant Friend is He; 
Oh, oh-oh, his eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches, watches it over me.

I sing because I'm happy (happy)
I sing because I'm free (free free free)
For His eye, his eye is on the sparrow, 
And I know, I know He watches over me
