Hey, oh, hey hey hey 
See I was born in Newark (sure was) 

We were always hand in hand 
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales 
Nip wore her pigtails 
I knew I loved him even then 
You know some disapproved it 
They even boo-hooed it 
But I told them time and time and time again 

You know I was made to love him 
Build my world around him and 
Hey, hey, hey 
He’s been my inspiration 
Sho’ nuff appeciation 
For the love I gave him through the years 

Like a sweet magnolia trea 
My love blossomed tenderly 
My love grew sweeter through the years 

I know my baby loves me 
My baby needs me 
That’s why we made it through the years 

I was made to love him 
Worship and adore him, yes say 
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, oh Lord 

All through thick and thin 
Our love just won’t end 
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh 

My baby loves me 
My baby needs me 
I know I ain’t going nowhere 
I was just a little thing 
The love bug hit me 
I had the fever with each passing year 

If all should tumble 
And the whole world crumble 
By his side I’ll still be standing, yeah 

Cuz I was made to love him 
Made meant for him, say 
Hey, hey, hey 
I was made to love him 
Build my world all around him say 
Hey, hey, hey 

I love my baby 
Nip aint’ going nowhere 
Say hey, hey, hey 

[Ad lib until fade]
