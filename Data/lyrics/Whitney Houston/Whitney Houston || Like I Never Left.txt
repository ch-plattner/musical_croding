[Adlib intro - Akon (Whitney)]
Konvict
Akon & Whitney, yeah
(Ohh yeah)

[Verse 1 - Whitney]
Did you ever wish you could take back something that you did in your past
If it wasn't for me I know what we had was definitely gonna last
I admit that we say some things we don't mean when we're mad
But I realized that I've been foolish, I never should have turned my back

[Hook 1 - Whitney]
Cuz it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone
And tell you ooh baby, baby I missed your lovin' so
I ain't holding back no more, your girl is coming home

[Chorus (Whitney)]
(And I want you to love me) Like I never left
(And I want you to hold me) Like I never left
(And I want you to touch me) Like I never left
(Come give me what I'm missing, yeah) Like I never left, yeah

[Verse 2 - Akon]
Do you think we can pick up where we left before the day
That I told you it was over, packed my things and moved away
Cuz I see that without you my world is just an empty place
Taking one step away from you feels like a million miles away

[Hook 2 - Akon]
Cuz it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times I just wanted to pick up the phone
And tell you ooh baby, baby I missed your lovin' so
But I ain't holding back no more, cuz your man is coming home, yeah

[Chorus (Whitney)]
(And I want you to love me, yeah) Like I never left
(And I want you to hold me) Like I never left
(And I want you to touch me baby) Like I never left
(Come give me what I'm missing, ohhh) Like I never left, yeah

[Bridge (Whitney)]
[Whitney]
I had enough, I miss you bad
What I did, leave in the past
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left (Ohhh)
[Akon]
Said back in the building, back on the block
You and me together, we back on top
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left
[Whitney]
I had enough, I miss you bad (I'm missing you bad)
What I did, leave in the past (Yeah)
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left (I'm coming back home boy)
[Akon]
Said back in the building, back on the block (I'm coming back home boy)
You and me together, we back on top (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left

[Chorus (Whitney)]
(And I want you to touch me) Like I never left
(And I want you to hold me) Like I never left
(And I want you to love me baby) Like I never left
(Come give me what I'm missing, yeah) Like I never left, yeah

[Vamp - Whitney]
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me, come touch me, come give me
Like I never left you (I never left you baby)
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me, come touch me, come give me
Like I never left you (I never left you baby)
