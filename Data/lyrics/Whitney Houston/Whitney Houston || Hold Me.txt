
I'll hold you, and touch you 
And make you my woman 
And give you my love with sweet surrender 
Tonight our hearts will beat as one 
And I will hold you, touch you 
And make you my woman tonight 

There's something in your eyes I see 
A pure and simple honesty 

[Chorus:]
Hold me in your arms tonight 
Fill my life with pleasure 
Let's not waste this precious time 
This moment's ours to treasure 
Hold me in your arms tonight 
We'll make it last forever 
When the morning sun appears 
We'll find our way together 

I believe you when you say that you love me 
Know that I won't take you for granted 
Tonight the magic has begun 
So won't you hold me, touch me 
Make me your woman tonight 

There's something in your eyes I see 
I won't betray your trust in me 

[chorus]

I'll hold you 
And touch you 
And make you my woman (make me your woman) tonight

[chorus]
