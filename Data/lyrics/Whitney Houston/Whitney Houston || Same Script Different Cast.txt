[SPOKEN]

[Whitney:] Um? Hey Deb. 
[Deborah Cox:] Mmm hmm? 
[WH:] Thank you for being woman enough to come. 
[DC:] Whitney, what's this about? 

[SUNG]

[WH:] I know he's leaving me for you. 
[DC:] Who said that? Who told you that it's true? 

[WH:]
What is he tellin' you? 
Could it be the same things that he told me? 

[DC:] He told me that he loved me. 
[WH:] I heard that. 
[DC:] He told me I was (harmony) beautiful. How did you know? How did you know? 
[WH:] Because I played that scene before. 

[CHORUS:]
This is a retake of my life. 
I was his star for many nights. 
Now the roles have changed, 
And you're the leading lady in his life. 
Lights, camera, now you're on. 
Just remember you've been warned. 
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last. 
Same script, different cast. 

[DC:]
What you're saying could be true. 
But how can I take advice from you? 

[WH:]
I'm not hating, 
But I wish the one before me 
Would have warned me too babe.

[DC:] Don't say no more. La La La La La La La La La 
[WH:] Uncover your ears, girl. 
[DC:] I'm not listening. La La La La La La La La La 

[WH:]
But I know you hear me. 
Maybe my reasons are wrong, 
But I know that you believe me. 

[CHORUS]

[DC] It's your fault you didn't love him enough. 

[WH:]
That's the problem. 
I loved him too much. 
And when you love him 
He becomes unattracted to you.

[DC:] Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong. 
[WH:] No you won't. 
[DC:] So go away. Leave us the hell alone! He loves me. 
[WH:] He'll hurt you. 
[DC:] He'll stay with me. 
[WH:] He'll leave you. 
[WH and DC:] For sure! For sure! 

[CHORUS]

[DC:]
This is a retake of my life. 
You were his star for many nights. 
But now the roles have changed. 
I'm the leading lady in his life. 
Lights, camera, now you're on. 
Just remember you've been warned. 
Enjoy it now, 'cause this will last. 
I'm the future, you're his past. 

[WH:]
This is a retake of my life. 
I was his star for many nights. 
Now the roles have changed, 
And you're the leading lady in his life. 

[WH and DC:]
Lights, camera, now you're on. 
Just remember you've been warned. 

[WH:] Enjoy it now. 
[DC:] Enjoy just now. 
[WH:] It won't last. 
[DC:] I know it will last. 
[WH and DC:] Same script, different cast.
