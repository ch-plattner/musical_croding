
Baby why I get so many people telling 
Me they seen you up in 
The mall 
Are they mistaking 
All up on some chick 
As though I don't exist 
What is this
Why they all up in our business 
It's just 2 ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
I just can't make up my mind 
Up my mind
Honey 2 many people say you're faking me 
They ask what have you done lately 
They say we won't last so they are predicting 
That it's over, it's over
Too many girls they dislike me 
Since I got you 
They wanna fight me 
Cause I'm the chick walking around 
With the ring 
Tell me why these hoes don't even like me

Why they all up in our business 
It's just 2 ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
I just can't make up my mind 
Up my mind

Oh boy it's all the love that you're giving 
They mind cause love is what they're missing 
That's why they stay up in our business
