We all wanna make a place in this world 
We all want our voices to be heard 
Every one wants a chance to be someone 
We all have dreams we need to dream 
Sweeter than any star you can reach 
Cuz when you reach and find, you've found someone 
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing 
The greatest gift this life can bring 
Is when you look back and know 
You were loved 

[Chorus:]
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart 
Along the way 
You can look back and say (mm) 
You were loved (yes you were) 

You can have diamonds in your hands 
Have all the riches in the land 
But, without love, 
You don't really have a thing, no no 
When somebody cares that you're alive 
When somebody trusts you with their life 
That's when you'll know (huh) 
That you have all you need 
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift 
The finest treasure that there is 
You can look back and know 
You were loved 

[Chorus:]
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart 
Along the way 
You can look back and say (mm) 
Yes, You were loved (yes you were now) 

[Bridge:]
So many roads that you can take 
Whatever way you go 
Don't take that road alone 
It's better you should know 

[Chorus:]
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart 
Along the way 
You can look back and say (mm) 
You did okay 
You were loved 

So remember to tell that special one (yeah, mm) 
You were loved 
You were loved 
You were loved 
You were loved 
Hey hey hey hey hey
