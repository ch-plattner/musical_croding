Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh

Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh
They played our song, we hit the floor
He held me strong, and we danced the night away, oh

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm singing oh

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinning round and round
Say oh, oh, say ah, baby

It's been a long, long time
Since I felt that love has found my way, oh
I've been looking, I've been searching
For the man to touch this place, oh yeah

Can't deny the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm singing oh

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinning round and round
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinning round and round
Say oh, oh, say ah, baby

If you feel good, if you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say yeah
If you feel good, if you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air, oh yeah

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinning round and round
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinning round and round
Say oh, oh, say ah, baby

Oh, if he makes you feel, oh, if he makes you feel
Go on and say, go on and say
Oh, if he makes you feel, oh, if he makes you feel
Go on and say ah, baby
