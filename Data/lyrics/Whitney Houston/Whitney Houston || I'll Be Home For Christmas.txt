
I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do.
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas.
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams.
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.

Oh oh ah I'll be home for Christmas.
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.
Oh Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love-light gleams.
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.

If only yeah
Well now, if only, only, only, only
If only in my dreams.
If only
Well, well, well Lord
If only oh
If only in my dreams.
