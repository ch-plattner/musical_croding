Our day will come 
And we'll have everything 
We'll share the joy 
Falling in love can bring 
No one can tell me 
That I'm too young to know 
I love you so and you love me 

Our day will come 
If we just wait a while 
No tears for us, 
Think love and wear a smile 
Our dreams have magic 
Because we'll always stay 
In love this way, 
Our day will come 

If we just wait a while 
Our dreams have magic 
Because we'll always stay 
In love this way, 
Our day will come 
Will come 
Will come
