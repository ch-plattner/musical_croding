
If I could turn back time 
If I could find a way I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did I don't know why I said the things I said 
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside 
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes.

I didn't really mean to hurt you I didn't wanna see you go I know I made you cry, but baby

[Chorus:]
If I could turn back time 
If I could find a way 
I'd take back those words that hurt you 
And you'd stay 
If I could reach the stars 
I'd give them all to you 
Then you'd love me, love me 
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time

My world was shattered I was torn apart 
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart 
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care 
But I lost everything darling then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry 
Too proud to tell you I was wrong 
I know that I was blind, and ooh...

[Chorus]

Ooohh

If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
ooh baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry
Ooohh

[Chorus #2]
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me 
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time (turn back time)
If I could find a way (find a way)
Then baby, maybe, maybe
You'd stay

[to fade]
Reach the stars
If I could reach the stars
