Bang bang you shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

I was five and you were six
We rode on horses made of sticks I wore black you wore white
You would always win the fight

Bang bang you shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up I called you mine
You would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang you shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
After echoes from a gun
We both vowed that we'd be one

Now you're gone I don't know why
Sometimes I cry
You didn't say goodbye
You didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang you shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down
