
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see 
Does my soul lay broken inside 
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see 
Have my tears washed away 
My foolish pride 

The nights are so long 
The days come on strong 
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see 
The pain I have borne 
My body's so worn 
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see 

The nights are so long 
The days come on strong 
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see 
The pain I have borne 
My body's so worn 
Look at me 
Tell me what do you see
