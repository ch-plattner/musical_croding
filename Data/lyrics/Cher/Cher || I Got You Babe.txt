[HER:] They say we're young and we don't know 
We won't find out until we grow 
[HIM:] Well I don't know if all that's true 
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you 

[HIM:] Babe 
[BOTH:] I got you babe I got you babe 

[HER:] They say our love won't pay the rent 
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent 
[HIM:] I guess that's so, we don't have a pot 
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got 

[HIM:] Babe 
[BOTH:] I got you babe I got you babe 

[HIM:] I got flowers in the spring I got you to wear my ring 
[HER:] And when I'm sad, you're a clown 
And if I get scared, you're always around 
[HER:] So let them say your hair's too long 
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong 
[HIM:] Then put your little hand in mine 
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb 

[HIM:] Babe 
[BOTH:] I got you babe I got you babe 

[HIM:] I got you to hold my hand 
[HER:] I got you to understand 
[HIM:] I got you to walk with me 
[HER:] I got you to talk with me 
[HIM:] Igot you to kiss goodnight 
[HER:] I got you to hold me tight 
[HIM:] I got you, I won't let go 
[HER:] I got you to love me so 

[BOTH:] I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe
