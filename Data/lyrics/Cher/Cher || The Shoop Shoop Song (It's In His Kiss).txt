How can I tell if he loves me so
Is it in his eyes?
Oh no! You'll be deceived
Is it in his sighs?
Oh no! He'll make believe
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

Is it in his face?
Oh no! That's just his charms
In his warm embrace?
Oh no! That's just his arms
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is 
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

Kiss him and squeeze him tight
Find out what you want to know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

How about the way he acts
Oh no! That's not the way
And you're not list'nin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

Hug him and squeeze him tight
Find out what you want to know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

How about the way he acts
Oh no! That's not the way
And you're not listnin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
