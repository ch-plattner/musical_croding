
When I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
Everywhere with my love
My love does it good, whoa
My love, oh only my love
My love does it good

And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood
Everywhere with my love
My love does it so good, whoa
My love, oh only my love
My love does it good

Only my love, oh only my love
Only my love, hold the other things to me
Oh, only my love, oh only my love
Only my love does it good to me

Everywhere with my love
Don't you see my love
It does it so good
Oh, only my love, only my love
My love does it good

Don't ever ask me why
I never say "good-bye" to my love
It's understood
'Cause everywhere with my love
My love does it good, whoa
Only my love, oh only my love
My love does it good

Oh only my love
Only my love does it good to me,whoa
