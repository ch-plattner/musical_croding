After love, after love [repeat]
No matter how hard I try 
You keep pushing me aside 
And I can't break through 
There's no talking to you 
So sad that you're leaving 
Takes time to believe it 
But after all is said and done 
You're going to be the lonely one, Ohh Oh 

[CHORUS:] 
Do you believe in life after love 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough, 
Now
Do you believe in life after love 
I can feel something inside me say 
I really don't think you're strong enough, 
Now 

What am I supposed to do 
Sit around and wait for you 
And I can't do that 
There's no turning back 
I need time to move on 
I need love to feel strong 
'Cause I've had time to think it through 
And maybe I'm too good for you Ohh Oh 

[CHORUS]

But I know that I'll get through this 
'Cause I know that I am strong 
I don't need you anymore 
Oh I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore 
No I don't need you anymore 

[CHORUS repeat to fade]
