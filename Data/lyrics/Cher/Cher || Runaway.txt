
Nobody said it would be easy
Nobody gives you guarantees
'Cos a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway to a place where nobody knows
Runaway gotta let this feeling go
Runaway if I can't find love,
I'm gonna runaway

Nobody's looking for perfection
How could they give it in return
But I told my heart to believe you
And you just gave your love to anyone

Runaway to a place where nobody knows
Runaway gotta let this feeling go
Runaway and I don't want to hurt anymore
Though my heart is always aching
If I can't find love,
I'm gonna runaway
