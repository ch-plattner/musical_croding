I've been romanced and I've been danced
Crazy nights and hard times
Life has lost it mystery
And love is blind, and can not find me

Cause I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
And shadows keep taking
My love and leaving me

I have past aside my foolish pride
Going down for the very last time
Cause I have searched this earth
And sailed the seas
But love is blind can not find me

[Chorus x2]
