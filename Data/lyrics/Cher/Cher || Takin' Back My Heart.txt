
I'm all through with lovin' you
Wasting my precious time on you
Gonna walk away, walk out,
Kiss this love goodbye
Ain't no words you're gonna say
Gonna change my mind
I don't deserve all the hurt,
Won't put up with the pain
Been too many lies baby,
Too many games
So I'm taking back my heart
Takin' back my heart, yeah
Repossessin' my affection
Takin' back my heart
Because baby, baby, baby
Don't belong to you no more
What did I ever see in you
How could I be so blind a fool
Gonna walk away, walk out,
Take my love and leave
Gonna save it up for somebody
Who really loves me
You don't deserve me around,
And now I'm gonna go
Kiss me goodbye baby,
I'm out the door
Takin' back my heart
Takin' back my heart, yeah
Repossessin' repossessin' my affection
Oh . . . yeah takin' back my heart
Because baby, baby, baby'
Don't belong to you no more
Given up all the pain
Packin' up till my pride
I've got one word to say
And that word is goodbye
If you'd just realized
Good love don't come for free
Then I wouldn't be
