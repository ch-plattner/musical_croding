Take me to heart
And I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted
Leaving love unshown
Makes will power weak
And temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood
Just like her man
If you want a do right all's day woman
You gotta be a do right all's night man

They say it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together
Show some respect for me
If you want a do right all's day woman
You gotta be a do right all's night man

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood
Just like her man
If you want a do right all's day woman
You gotta be a do right all's night man

If you want a do right all's day woman
You gotta be a do right all's night man
If you want a do right all's day woman
You gotta be a do right all's night man
