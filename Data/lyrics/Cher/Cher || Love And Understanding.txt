
Here, here in this world
Where do we go? Where can we turn?
When we need some love
It seems that love just can't be found
Where, where do we stand?
When love's supply don't meet love's demand

We got enough stars to light the sky at night
Enough sun to make to make the whole world bright
We got more than enough
But there's one thing there's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love to ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why, oh why?

Spend all of our time
Building buildings up to the sky
Reaching everywhere
But where we need to reach the most
Hearts never can win
Oh, in this race, this race that we're in

We've got enough cars to drive around the world
Enough planes to take us anywhere
We got more than enough
But there's one thing there's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love to ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why, oh why?

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love to ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why, oh why?

We need some understandin'
We need a little more love
Some love and understandin'

Enough stars to light the sky at night
Enough sun to make the whole world bright
Enough hearts to find some love inside
We got more than enough
But there's one thing there's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love to ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why, oh why?
