
Again evening finds me at your door 
Here to ask you just once more 
If we could try again 
I don't know quite what to say 
Never was too good that way 
So won't you help me again 

I don't know what made me leave 
If you just take me back you see 
How much I love you 

Again don't stand crying in the door 
If you believe your eyes once more 
You see I'll never lie again
