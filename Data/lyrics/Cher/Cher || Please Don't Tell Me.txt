Ya shook the override 
Why'd I get this far this time 
A ton of more I mean 
Ridin' hell and the mile this time I see 

Drift machine ago 
It's one you'll never know 

An hour lates too soon 
Surround the stop right through 
A sound far too long 
Explode, fail and see goin' to and I'm gone 

Drift machine ago 
It's one you'll never know
