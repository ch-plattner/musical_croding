'Cause in this world we are born to fight
Be the best, prove them wrong
A winner's work is never done, reach the top, number one

Oh, perfection
You drive me crazy with perfection
I've worn my pride as my protection
Perfection, ohh

I was taught to be tough
That the best that you can be ain't enough
Crack the whip, sacrifice
But I found out paradise had a price

I didn't know it then, but oh I know it now
You gotta work as hard as love to make the love work out
You know this heart of mine has made some big mistakes
I guess that when it comes to love, I just don't know what I takes

All my life I've been driven by perfection
Pushed it to the limit every day and night
Ohh, I've been driven by perfection
But nothing's perfect when love ain't right
Nothing's perfect when the love ain't right

Gave it all, played my part
I gave everything I had but my heart
Worked so hard, made a name
But the loneliness inside stays the same

When love is here today, and then it's gone today
You got a list of lovers lookin' like a resume
You gotta take some time to make it something real
I guess that when it comes to love, I just don't know how to feel

All my life I've been driven by perfection
Pushed it to the limit every day and night
Ohh, I've been driven by perfection
But nothing's perfect when love ain't right
Nothing's perfect when the love ain't right

Oh, perfection
You drive me crazy with perfection
I've worn my pride as my protection
I'm goin' crazy with perfection

Ohh, I didn't know it then, but oh I know it now
You gotta work as hard as love to make the love work out
You know this heart of mine has made some big mistakes
I guess that when it comes to love, I just don't know what I takes

I've been driven by perfection
Pushed it to the limit every day and night
Ohh, I've been driven by perfection
But nothing's perfect when love ain't right

All my life I've been driven by perfection
Pushed it to the limit every day and night
Ohh, I've been driven by perfection
But nothing's perfect when love ain't right

All my life I've been driven by perfection
Pushed it to the limit every day and night
Ohh, I've been driven by perfection
But nothing's perfect when love ain't right

All my life I've been driven by perfection
