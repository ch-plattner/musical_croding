
Don't makes no difference
If you lay down and cry
You know that you lied to me
And if you come to me
With tears in your eyes
Don't say good-bye
Just leave

Cause I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
How can my reasons for living
Slip right through my hands
I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
And if looks like I lose again

Don't make no difference
What you think of me
You know that I'm restless and afraid
And if you love me
I know that you will see
You can't keep me
To the promises that I made

Cause I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
How can my reasons for living
Slip right through my hands
I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
And if looks like I lose again

Don't make no difference
What you think about me
After all you took me for a ride
Now every night with you
I still seem to find
I just can't keep you satisfied

Cause I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
How can my reasons for living
Slip right through my hands
I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
And if looks like I lose again

Cause I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
How can my reasons for living
Slip right through my hands
I'm in the middle of something
I don't understand
And if looks like I lose again
