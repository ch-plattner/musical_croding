
What'll I do, when you are far away
And I'm so blue what'll I do
What'll I do when I am wondering
Who is kissing you
What'll I do

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to

When I am alone
With all the dreams of you
That won't come true
What will I do

What'll I do when you are far away
And I am blue what'll I do
