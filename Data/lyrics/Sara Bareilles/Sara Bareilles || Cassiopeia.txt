
Come in close now it's time to tell the story
Long ago, and so many years before we
Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be
There was her and her very first heartbeat

All alone in a corner of the night sky
Spiral bones of a supernova starlight
Fell in love with another burning bright
She dreamed of a way to ignite she said

Tonight
Come on, come on collide
Break me to pieces I
I think you're just like heaven
Why, come on, come on collide
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven
Just like heaven
Just like heaven

Such a shame nowhere near even a near miss
Light years away from the hope of being sun-kissed
Anchored home in her interstellar sea but
Poor lonely Cassiopeia

So she sighs and she burns with desperation
Learns to cry over love of constellations
Then a spark from a star shooting too close
They both smiled "What a day to explode"
She said

Tonight
Come on, come on collide
Break me to pieces I
I think you're just like heaven
Why, come on, come on collide
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven
Just like heaven
Just like heaven

Long ago in a sky built before us
A supernova grew up to be stardust
