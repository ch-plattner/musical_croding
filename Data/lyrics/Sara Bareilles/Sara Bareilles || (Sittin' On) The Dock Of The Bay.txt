Sittin' in the  morning sun
I'll be sittin' til the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah

Sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Oh, oh

Left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
'Cause I got nothing to live for
And nothing's gonna come my way, yeah

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll  away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything's gonna stay the same
I can't do what ten people tell me do
So guess I'm just gonna stay the same

I'm sittin' here, resting my bones
'Cause this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh,

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasitn' time, wastin' time, wastin' time
