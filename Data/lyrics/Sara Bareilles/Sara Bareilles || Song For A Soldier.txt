
Ooh...

Since you went away, 
You can color me, colour me, colour me, colour me in grey
So I'm working on the words I want to say
I never knew, never knew, never knew your name
You're just my soldier, babe

You lost track of the days
They come and they go, and they come and they go
There's no way that I could keep up with it
And I pray
And I wonder, wonder, wonder if you hear me
Ten thousand miles away

Hey soldier
I'm missing your life
Wish I could hold ya
And make it alright
Sending you my love and a little light
I never told ya
That you're my soldier
But goodnight

You know it's gonna take, gonna take, gonna take more time
Till we're staring up at the same sky
And so I'm going to wait, going to wait, going to wait in line
Till my soldier's mine

Hey soldier
I'm missing your life
Wish I could hold ya
And make it alright
Sending you my love and a little light
I never told ya
That you're my soldier
Goodnight

I don't care how long it takes
I'm not going anywhere, love (no)
You see there
This distance only makes me 
Say it over and over till it gets to you
My soldier (ooh)

Hey soldier
I'm missing your life
Wish I could hold ya
And make it alright
Sending you my love and a little light
I never told ya

You're my soldier
Goodnight
Sending you my love and a little light
I never told ya
That you're my soldier

Goodnight (Goodnight)
Goodnight (Goodnight)
Goodnight, Goodnight
Goodnight, Goodnight
Mmm...
