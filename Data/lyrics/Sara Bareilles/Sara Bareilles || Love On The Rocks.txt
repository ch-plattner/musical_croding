We met on a rainy evening in the summertime
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine, love of mine
Still I got nothing to show for it

Here's a simplification of everything we're going though
You plus me is bad news
But you're a lovely creation and I like to think that I am too
But my friend said I look better without you.

Tongue tied and twisted, go on baby and go to my head.

Babe, baby believe me
If I stay it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
Love on the rocks.

You love the chase but hate me for the runaround
We both just tired of the whole thing.
You tell me what you want you need you know you have to have
And I just pretend I'm listening

Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.

Babe, baby believe me
If I stay it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down.

Hot as hell, cold as ice, sip it slow cause it's so nice
Dulls my senses, drives my pain, but I do it again
Burns a bit to the touch, dangerous if it's too much
If this bottle could talk
Love on the rocks

Baby, baby, baby, baby believe me
(Stay here, this ain't gonna be easy)
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
