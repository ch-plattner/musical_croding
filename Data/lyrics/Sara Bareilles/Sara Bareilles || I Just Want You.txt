
Give me a heart to hold the godlike truth
Give me one good soul that I can tell it through
Give me good reason to believe in you
And give me strength if you have time

Give me two hands that'll hold this up
And know you give me no more than just enough
You gave a pair of brown eyes that could call a good bluff
And somebody who thinks they shine

You, I just want you
I just want you

Spent most of my life on a microphone
Giving all that I got 'til I head back home
And when the lights go out, and I'm all alone
I've got no reason to be crying

And on a bad day I feel like a masochist
Take it away from me if it's for the best
Somehow I've ended up the head of this
Freight train that isn't mine

You, I just want you
I just want you

So take it all away
If it isn't meant for me
I don't want the easy way
I just want you
They can give me everything
But at the end of the day
The only words I'll say
Is "I just want you"

Ooooh, mmmm, mmmm

It's all so simple when you break it all down
Two roads converged down on a hallowed ground
It's taken all my life to hear the sacred sound
Of sweet simplicity

Saying "Give it all back, it don't mean a thing"
You got a short-lived life and a song to sing
And the only way up is believing
In never looking down

So take it all away
If it isn't meant for me
I don't want the easy way
I just want you
They can give me everything
But at the end of the day
The only words I'll say
Is "I just want you"

You, you, you
You, you, you, mmmm
