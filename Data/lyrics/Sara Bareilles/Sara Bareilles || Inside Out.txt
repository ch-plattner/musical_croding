
I've been winding 
Down the same road for days 
I've seen the coastline 
Going both ways 
Some days are perfect 
And some simply could not get worse 
Some days it's all worth it 
And some days this life is nothing but a curse 

And I wonder who will break first 

I am small 
I feel like no more than nothing at all 
But when I lose sight of daylight 
And my darkness falls 
I'll be strong 
And if not now it won't be long 
From when I lose sight of daylight 
And my hands are weak 
And my soul is tired 
Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out 
From the inside out 

Little spirit 
Now don't you desert me now 
I know I don't always hear it 
You don't always speak so loud 
And I'm not willing 
To simply lay down my soul for this 
It may be all that I'm giving 
But take my love for what it is 

I am small 
I feel like no more than nothing at all 
But when I lose sight of daylight 
And my darkness falls 
I'll be strong 
And if not now it won't be long 
From when I lose sight of daylight 
And my hands are weak and my soul is tired 
Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out  

Take your best shot 
Here I stand, heart in hand 
And fearless I'm not 
But I am what I am 
And I know what I'm not 
And I know enough to know it's never 
Gonna be much more than weather 
You can't drive me away 
When it's only rain
On the inside 
It's only rain 
From the inside
It's only rain 
From the inside
It's only rain 
From the inside
From the inside out
I am small
From the inside out
I am small
