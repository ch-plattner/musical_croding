
I've been down, I've been out 
I did it all on my own 
Seems growing up 
Didn't take long 
I feel strange, I feel good 
I feel better with you 
You've changed, you should 
Cause I think I did too 

Made my mistakes 
I did a few things right 
But it will take what it will take 
Baby, that's life 
You cannot change what you do not own 
Everybody knows 
But if you live deep and love strong 
You get pretty damn close 

It moves fast and it scares me 
I close my eyes, oh but I still see 

I'm fading in and out 
What are you supposed to do save me know 
From all of this danger you don't know how 
And I'll find my way out 
When I'm in the red 
Listening to strangers inside my head 
The darkening angels beneath the bed 
I still see everything you said 
Crimson in red 

I shake and I smile 
Cause you said 
Baby girl, it may take a while, but take the good from the bad 
And never minds are never sure, so never leave them wanting more 
What are you waiting for 
How you love is who you are 

I dive in and I sink in 
And I find new colors to think in 

I'm fading in and out 
What are you supposed to do save me know 
From all of this danger you don't know how 
And I'll find my way out 
When I'm in the red 
Listening to strangers inside my head 
The darkening angels beneath the bed 
I still see everything you said 
Crimson in red 

In the distance is a line defining where I've been 
Rhe state I'm in 
And ever since it began to slip from my two hands I've been 
Taunting fires, touching wires, been believing liars 
Everything they said 
Painted in red 
Painted in red
Painted in red

I am fading in and out 
What are you gonna do save me know 
From all of this danger you don't know how 
I'll find my way out 
When I'm in the red 
Listening to strangers inside my head 
The darkening angels beneath the bed 
I still see what you said  

What are you gonna do 
No way for you to save me 
What are you gonna do 
Everything that you gave me 
Is painted in red
