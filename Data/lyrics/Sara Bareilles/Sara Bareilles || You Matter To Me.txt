I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes
They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear
Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you
And I'll stay there as long as you let me

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

It's addictive the minute you let yourself think
The things that I say just might matter to someone
All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away
And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

And you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you
(Out of hiding I'm right here beside you)
You matter too
(As long as you have me)
I promise you do, you, you matter too
(Out of hiding I'm right here beside you)
I promise you do, you, you matter too
(I do, I promise you do, you matter to me)
I promise you do, you see
You matter to me
