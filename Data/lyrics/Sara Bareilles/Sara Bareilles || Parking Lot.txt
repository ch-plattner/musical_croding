
It's a feeling my hands and feet held to the floor
Like I'm kneeling crawl straight to
What fate sent through
Holding down the only solid ground
I could find cause I don't want to try the other kind
I don't have it yet a good sense of knowing when
What I do should be immediate
But all this waiting for a sign
From the other side
For fuck's sake this is just a timeline
Just a timeline just a timeline
Yeah Sara stop it pick out your paralysis and unlock it
And flex the fear till it builds you a rocket
And rise and if you fall
At least you end up between where you will be
And where you will have been
Yeah

I can't keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot
Can't stay here no not anymore
Can't stay here no not anymore
Oh I just keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot
Can't stay here no not anymore
Can't stay here no not anymore

Wooo oh oh
Wooo oh oh

Wish I was lying
My worry circles my brain like it's dying
And that redhead vulture is well fed
But what that mutiny used to be is no use to me now
Tell me how it all turns out cause I'm not sticking around

I can't keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot
Can't stay here no not anymore
Can't stay here no not anymore
Oh I just keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot
Can't stay here no not anymore
Can't stay here no not anymore

Wooo oh oh
Wooo oh oh

Can't breathe in the parking lot
Give me divine dissatisfaction
Give me the heart unsettled soul
Give me emotion into action
Cause I can't take this anymore

Can't breathe in the parking lot
Wooo oh oh
Wooo oh oh
Not anymore
Can't breathe in the parking lot
Wooo oh oh
Wooo oh oh
