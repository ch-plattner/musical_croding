
If I build it out of blood and bone
If I love it and I even give it a good name
And I let it stand up on it's own
And if I even ever learn to trust and walk away

Will it crumble on it's own two feet?
Or will it multiply and grow big, white wings?
If I love it and I give it life
Can I let it go and know that it was never mine?

Give more,
Give it all away
I'm sure it'll come back someday
You gotta let go to let it circle back around
To rise up you gotta learn to root down
Learn to root down

If I cut it with a heart-shaped knife
And I send it to my very closest of friends
And they somehow bring it back to life
What if I only ever do it all over again?

I'm a writer here upon this ship
On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages
And every vessel's meant for pouring out
And every bloom has to make room to root down

Give more,
Give it all away
I'm sure it'll come back someday
You gotta let go to let it circle back around
To rise up you gotta learn to root down
Learn to root down
Learn to root down

Give more,
Give it all away
I'm sure it'll come back someday
You gotta let go to let it circle back around
To rise up you gotta learn to root down
