[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet
Got this sugary me stuffed in my sleeve
And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things
And I'm just who you want me to be
But like most creatures down here on the ground
I'm composed of the elements moving around
And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a bitch
But that only happens when I get provoked
By some piece of shit asshole we all sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

[Chorus:]
And that guy's an asshole
That girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole
Oh-asshole
Asshole
Asshole

[Verse 2:]
I see I've surprised you with some of my words
And I know that surprises, while fun, still can hurt
And I hate to think that I ruined the day
Of the dick and the queen of the high horse parade
But I'm sick and tired of your poisonous ways
Your toxin wasting perfectly good space
And I say what I think
'Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink

[Chorus:]
That guy's an asshole
That girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

[Verse 3:]
And I won't let him in
Under my skin
You're a sad sack of shit
That's pathetic
Just a festering sore
Who will never be more than that
If I don't let it

[Chorus:]
And that guy's an asshole
That girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

[Chorus:]
That guy's an asshole
That girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole
