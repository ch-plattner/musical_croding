The afternoon has settled long and heavy on my shoulders
The winter's light feels different on my skin
It doesn't seem to strike as far below the surface so
I have to conclude that shadow won't let it in
That shadow won't let it in, shadow won't let it in

December...
You've always been a problem child
December...
You run me down right restless and wild
And I remember when you used to be mine
December...
December...

The leaves are all still changing, the weather here is mild and vacant
A winter's blooming on Los Angeles
The artificial cold is more than I was hoping for
But not enough to consume the darkened state I'm in
The darkened state I'm in, the darkened state I'm in

December...
You've always been a problem child
December...
You run me down right restless and wild
But I remember when you used to be mine
December...
December...

Distill a whole year down into a day
Act like we all start over with a pristine slate
But to get yourself a new life you've got to give the other one away
And I'm starting to believe in the power of a name
Cause it can't be a mistake if I just call it change

December...
Can't turn around now
December...
Break the chain, can't live in circles again
