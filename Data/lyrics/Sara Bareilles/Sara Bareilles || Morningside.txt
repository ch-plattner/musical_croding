
I'm not scared of you now
Or so i say
There's no reason to run
Although i may
I'm not as sure as i seem
This much i know
What does it mean you leave and i follow

I could try to forget what you do when i let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain i desire
Til you get to me on my morningside

Keep my distance i tried
No use
But no matter the miles
I'm back to you

I could try to forget what you do when i let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain i desire
Til you get to me on my morningside

Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
What it looks like here on my morningside

Look back don't you dare let me start to do that
I don't care if the things that i have
Only make me afraid to lose i
Need to let go
Need to want to keep letting you know
That we both have a reason to follow
Long as we let this lead i'm barely breathing

I try to forget what you do to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain
Til you get to me on my morningside

Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
What it looks like here on my morningside
