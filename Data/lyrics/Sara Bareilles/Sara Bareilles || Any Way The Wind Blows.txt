Can't tell you the truth--
'least I don't like 'bout that.
A kind of comfort in you
comes when you lie right back
Safe from such a strange point of view:
to hear your own words on you.

I'm onto you; go to be gone,
you are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in.
Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows,
any way the wind blows in
Any way the wind blows in.

Same all the creatures, we are
chasing the pipe dream down.
Love elusive so far
keeps us divided now
Go, go on and write me love songs
so I've something to sing when you're gone.

I'm onto you; go to be gone,
you are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in.
Don't wanna come down too low.
Any way the wind blows,
any way the wind blows in.
Don't wanna come down, do you know the way
to be in one place but sway any way the wind's blowing?

You are loved.
You are monsters and angels:
untouched, unseen.
All in one, I take all that you are
'cause you're just like me
But you move,
and it's hard to stay close to a satellite
So I lose sight of you
till you come 'round again
I'm watching the wind.

Hey-ey, hey-ey
Hey-ey, yeah
Any way the winds blow in

I'm onto you; go to be gone,
you are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in.
Don't wanna come down too low.
Any way the wind blows,
any way the wind blows in.
Don't wanna come down, do you know the way
to be in one place but stay any way the wind's blowing?
Any way the wind's blowing
