
He bends his breath around my name 
And I am humbled 
I feel small and plain 
But his arms are angels by his side 
You need not ask if they're open, just how wide 

His lips are day 
And his skin is night 
Oooh, and with our love we conjure up the twilight 
His fingers are music to my soul 
And I feel his song play everywhere I go 

My love, my love is on his way 
I can't wait to see the day 
I thankfully lay me down 
Oh, my love, my love is on his way 
I'm waiting patiently 
But if you see me now 
My love, please hurry 

He loves with rhythm 
And paints with flame 
He comes in pieces with no name 
I won't need answers, I'll just know 
Cause I've read the sonnets about his soul 

He can be ordinary in the best ways 
And still dance like a poet 
Through every word he says 

My love, my love is on his way 
I can't wait to see the day I thankfully 
Lay me down 
My love, my love is on his way 
I'm waiting patiently 
But if you see me now 
My love, please hurry 

All that I never knew 
Can you see me now 
All that I never said 
Can you see me now 

He makes me crazy 
He makes me cruel 
Oh, but I pray he makes me anything 
But a fool 

Oooh, my love
Please hurry
