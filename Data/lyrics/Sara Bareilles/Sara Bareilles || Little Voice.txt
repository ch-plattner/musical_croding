
It's everything I am and what I'm not 
And all I'm trying to be
This is the part where I spit it all out 
and you decide what you think of me
I'm not trying to be complicated 
I'm never waiting to get the last laugh
But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
and I'd like a little bit back

It's just a little voice
and if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest thing
It's just my little voice I've been missing

Looking over the precious moments
It hurts don't it
They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering the better things will make the bad ones go away
But I've been broken and the one to blame
So my savior is self defense taught me to 
sing what I can't say

It's just a little voice
and if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest thing
It's just my little voice I've been missing

I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you words are not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you noise is not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you words are not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you noise is not enough
It's the reason you whisper... you love her alone
We've been handed the mountaintops to scream from and we still don't
Scream from and we still don't

It's just a little voice
and if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest thing
It's just my little voice 
And if you're listening
It's just my little voice
That I've been missing
It's just my little voice I've been missing
It's just my little voice I've been missing
It's just my little voice I've been missing
