[Verse 1:]
Tell the truth, no lies
I can take it
Bend your breath, just this once
Run your mouth
I bet I can catch it
You sound just like a Judas

[Chorus:]
And if there's anything I learned
That will keep me standing
If I take you at your word
Then I'm empty handed
A tongue like yours should be burned and branded
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would color red
When you breathe it in
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me

[Verse 2:]
Lost be found
I'm a bloodhound born for seeking
Poor prey, you must be tired
Stood your ground
But your airtight drums were bleeding
And now it's all on fire

[Chorus:]
If there's anything I learned
That will keep me standing
If I take you at your word
Then I'm empty handed
A tongue like yours should be burned and branded
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would color red
When you breathe it in
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me
