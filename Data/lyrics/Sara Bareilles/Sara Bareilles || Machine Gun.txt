
Tell me off in a letter
Completely ignore me
Getting high off of saying
Why you don't adore me?

Baby, please, I'm well versed
In how I might be cursed
I don't need it articulated

Stand in line wasting
All of your time just to hate me
Every dime gone to ways
You can find that might bait me

And drag me down, sight set proudly
Bring me to the ground see
You love to be somebody's enemy

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once?
Give up the machine gun
Machine gun

Locked and loaded
You're practically floating away now
In your fortress you feel like
You're more or less safe now

But let me say I don't mean harm
Oh, but, baby, you'd be charming if you'd come undone
Get back where you started from

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once?
Give up the machine gun
Machine gun

Never mind how you've rationed your time
And the battle is underway
Maybe times are gonna change
Don't just hide in the silence behind

What you've really been trying to say
What a skill, baby, aiming to kill me
With words you don't mean

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once?
Give up the machine gun

Will you try it once?
Give up the machine gun
Will you try it once?
Give up the machine gun
Machine gun
