
Babe, will you save me a dance by the river
Moonlight is serving us well
She makes the whole world silhouette 
Makes it flicker like film on a strip
Don’t let the sadness in yet to react as if
Somehow it’s all come and gone
Let’s pretend we’re all healed up and happy and moved on

Tonight let the moon come shine 
Let us remain you and I
Tell the sun not to rise 
For the darkest time
Moonlight keep us steady 
Give me one more night then I’m ready
To let go, to know we are only shadows.

Babe, I’m so sorry to ask 
I’m ashamed but tonight I just can’t give you up
I shackled myself to the past and my will has gone missing
Let’s call our shadow selves out for the evening
And watch them remember our love 
Tomorrow will come and I know they’ll be leaving 
That our time is up

Tonight let the moon come shine
Let us remain you and I
Tell the sun not to rise for the darkness lies
Moonlight keep us steady
Give me one more night then I’m ready
To let go, to know we will are only shadows, only shadows, only shadows
