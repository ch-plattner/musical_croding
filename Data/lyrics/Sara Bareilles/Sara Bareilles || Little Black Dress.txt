Just different wrapping around it
No need to soften your words, they're still gonna hurt
So don't pull punches
I tried to be everything you'd ever want
And sometimes I even stood on my heart and stomped
Now I'm finally alone and dressed for the show
But going nowhere
They don't need to see me crying

I'll get my little black dress on
And if I put on my favorite song
I'm gonna dance until you're all gone
I'll get my little black dress on

You came, lifted me up but then you dropped a hurricane
Now I'm fighting to find the ground again, to steady my feet
Get up off my knees and just remember
That I am more than just somebody's puppet
I can find the cord and then I'll cut it
I stand a pretty good chance to dust myself off and dance

I'll get my little black dress on
And if I put on my favorite song
I'm gonna dance until you're all gone
I'll get my little black dress on
I got my little black dress on
And if I tell myself that nothing's wrong
This doesn't have to be a sad song
Not with my little black dress on

It's time to connect the dots and draw a different picture up
And paint it with the colors of everything I ever was
Return to the scene of the crime, the day I let the music die
And rewrite the final lines cause this time I

I'll get my little black dress on
And if I put on my favorite song
I'm gonna dance until you're all gone
I'll get my little black dress on
I got my little black dress on
And if I tell myself that nothing's wrong
This doesn't have to be a sad song
Not with my little black dress on
