
Playing for love
Playing for keeps
Playing for light come down
And set me free
Playing to say
Playing for change
Playing for peace

Brother, Brother
Come walk with me
Show me the tops of the canyons above the sea
And say look around you
This kingdom’s wide
To carry the weight of this world with pride
I am humbled
And I’m confused
There is no mountain I’ve found here that I can move
You say sweet love
Your heart is great
So will you follow it closely and let it show you your fate

And keep playing for love
Playing for keeps
Playing for light come down
And set me free
Playing to say
Playing for change
Playing for peace

Darling, Darling
Come take my hand
See that no border, no boundary can hold you in
And let loose your voices
And raise them up
Remember to let through the music it helps to continue to carry us

Playing for love
And playing for keeps
Playing for light come down
Set us free
Playing to say
Playing for change
Playing for peace

Ooh ooh

I am playing for love
Playing for keeps
I’m playing for light come down
And set me free
I’m playing to say
Playing for change
Playing for change
Playing for change
Playing for peace
