
Holding my breath,
Last one I’ve got left
'til I see you
Deliver my heart
With the pieces and parts
Of me left

Every last day
Seemed to carry the weight
Of a life time
Watch from the ground
As the gold fluttered down
From the sky

Sweet sun
Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer
To you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
'Til you come in and out
Of view
Of view

Inches away from you
Scared what I’ll take from you,
Darling
I could live with your ghost
If you say that’s the most
That I’ll get

Darkness to light
Moved from day into night
To be near you
Still here I stand
I am sinking like sand
In your sea

Sweet sun
Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer
To you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
'Til you come in and out
Of view
Oh, you already do

Never you mind
Whether evening should find
Us together
Distance can’t take
What is hidden here safe
In my chest

I’ll wait for the day
When we finally say
Now or never
'Til then I’ll be here
Wanting more
As I settle for atmosphere

Sweet sun
Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer
To you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
'Til you come in and out
I will breathe in, breathe out 'til you come in
I will breathe in, breathe out 'til you come in and out
Of view
Of view
