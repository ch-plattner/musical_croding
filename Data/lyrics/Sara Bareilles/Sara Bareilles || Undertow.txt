
Silly me, look what I did again 
I found what I want 
Is what I cannot have 
I didn't mean to be so predictable 
But I blame it all on who made you irresistible 

And it isn't something I need 
'til you tell me I can't 
Why wear my heart on my sleeve 
When it looks so good in your hand 

My heart breaks in a heart beat 
And you storm me when you come and go 
The taste of something so sweet should have 
Warned me 'bout the undertow 
Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go 

Little girl, I don't know why you stay 
If I had a feather for every time daddy said that I could fly away 
Old habits are so hard to break 
It'd be a shame to stop now that I've started to make really good mistakes 

And I don't know why I must ask 
For the forbidden fruit 
I saw the snake in the grass 
But I had bitten too soon 

My heart breaks in a heart beat 
And you storm me when you come and go 
The taste of something so sweet should have 
Warned me 'bout the undertow 
Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go 

I should have seen you coming in 
Should recognize the signs a wave's gonna break 
Now, I've given in, why fight it when 
I'm resigned to simply live in your wake 
Your wake 

Heart breaks in a heart beat 
And you storm me when you come and go 
The taste of something so sweet should have 
Warned me 'bout the undertow 
Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go 
No no no no
I couldn't find a better man to let me go
