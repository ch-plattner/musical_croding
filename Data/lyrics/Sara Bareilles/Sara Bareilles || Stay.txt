Saturday, empty room, filled with people 
It don't mean a thing to
You and I, holding hands
Nobody knows, nobody understands
I don't care for sunlight
That only means it's over
And I'm in no mood for that

Stay tonight
Don't come morning, don't come light
They may be lies, say it, say that we'll be alright
If we stay tonight

My hands are shaking
This is a complicated love with me
Keep your eyes closed, I've seen it baby
I've seen where this goes

Stay tonight
Don't come morning, don't come light
They may be lies, but say that we'll be alright
If we stay tonight

Gonna feel it baby
Oh I don't wanna cry
I know we'll get to tomorrow and say goodbye
That's what I'm asking for
Tonight

Stay tonight
Don't come morning, don't come light
They may be lies but say that we'll be alright
Say that we're gonna be alright
Tonight
