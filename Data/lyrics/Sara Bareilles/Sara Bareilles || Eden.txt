
Let me paint a picture for you then I'll have to teach you to see it
Illustrate the remnants of the life I used to live here in Eden
Rolled a lucky pair of dice, ended up paradise
Landed on a snake's eyes, took a bite and ended up bleeding

You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name
The truth is all those angels started acting the same
And I know there's no going back now cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
No way to make the pain play fair
It doesn't disappear just because you say it isn't there
So when they ask why'd she go you can say cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
Life in Eden changed

Walking in the garden was a serpent-shaped heart and he told me
That what is broken cannot show, and less than beautiful is worse than unholy
Idolized my innocence, stole it from me in the end
Now I'm wide awakened and still paying for the poison they sold me

You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name
The truth is all those angels started acting the same
And I know there's no going back now cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
No way to make the pain play fair
It doesn't disappear just because you say it isn't there
So when they ask why'd she go you can say cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
Life in Eden changed

There was a time when I was taking all bets
That this place was even better than as good as it gets
And now looking back from the outside in
I think I was choking on the air in Eden

You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name
The truth is all those angels started acting the same
And I know there's no going back now cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
No way to make the pain play fair
It doesn't disappear just because you say it isn't there
So when they ask why'd she go you can say cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
When they ask why'd she go you
Cause life in Eden
Life in Eden changed
Life in Eden changed
Life in Eden changed
