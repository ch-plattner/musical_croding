
California in the evening 
Rush past the water 
Get me over the great state line 
The skies electrical it's screaming 
Trying to find the morning 
Hell I'd settle for the other side
Don't bother counting up the days boy 
Numbers gettin' bigger by the minute and I'm so tired 
But I can honestly say boy 
Oh unless you're in it I don't want it so here it comes 
Fire 
Over the horizon keeping my eyes on 
Wire 

All the way in Carolina 
I won't go home until I find ya 
Ya fill my bones my mind up so 
I'm coming to Carolina 
Don't ya know I'm right behind ya 
No love of mine 
Is gonna wind 
Up leaving me for Carolina 

Don't feel the summer like I used to 
Oh you brought thunder, tugged me under, its all your fault 
Want me to let you leave do you? 
Well I never minded aftermath 
And this is what happens to a 
Liar 
Miles on the highway 
Nothing to stop me 
Until I'm done 

Coming for you Carolina 
Won't go home till I find ya
Ya fill my bones my mind up so 
I'm coming to Carolina 
Don't you know I'm right behind ya 
No love of mine 
Is gonna wind 
Up leaving me for Carolina 

I don't mind the rain it suits me 
Makes the pain pursuit seem 
Less unruly 
It's been a good night 
And one hell of a drive 

Coming for you Carolina 
Won't go home till I find ya 
Ya fill my bones my mind up so 
I'm coming to Carolina 
Don't you know I'm right behind ya 
No love of mine 
Is gonna wind 
Up leaving me for Carolina 
Leaving me for Carolina 
Leaving me for Carolina
