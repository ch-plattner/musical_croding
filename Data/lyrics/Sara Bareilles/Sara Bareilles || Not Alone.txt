
It comes calling in the evening
When the temperature is dropping out
They said it don't get cold here
But I beg to differ now

There is something in the shadows
More than sister silhouette
Something sinister and strange
That I haven't seen yet

And I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

You don't have to fight the bad guys
Throwing punches out into the black
If you have to tell me lies, I don't care
Just give me some good back

I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

And if I only worry 'bout it
Worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it
I just keep breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down

Boy, I could do without
Do without, do without
A night of the bad dreams, sad things
Tell me what that means

I don't want to be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
The monsters aren't real
You're making me feel
I'm not alone
