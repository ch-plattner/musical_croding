I must be crazy
I can't see straight anymore
I'm ten feet from your door.
Surprise, dear--you both don't know
that I'm here watching alone.
My worst fear, now my home.

Such a cruel
Such a cruel heart
Such a cruel, cruel heart.

Her eyes, they shine on you
While I stay under the August moon
and I pray sleep comes soon
Why did I come here?
Look what you've undone, dear
Once two, now one here.

Just a cruel
Just a cruel heart
Just a cruel, cruel heart.

I don't know what I'm gonna say
when I go, who I'm gonna blame
in this pain, in this goodbye, oh.
I don't brave, broken down
and I crave the very ground
that I'm slave to
and I'll cry on.

I'm ten feet from your door
My heart beat not anymore
I'm empty and not yours.

Just a cruel
Just a cruel heart
Just a cruel, cruel, cruel heart
Just a cruel, cruel heart.
