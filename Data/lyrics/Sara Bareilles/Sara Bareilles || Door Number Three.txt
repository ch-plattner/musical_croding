
Door number two
It's for you, little lady
Is it all that you dreamed of?
How, if I knew, would've been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up

Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes

He takes what he can, what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in

And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
And he lifts me, but never once carried
Door number two I've already walked through

Ask me the question
Who coulda guessed I'd be here at this crossroad?
Plain to be seen that it's all up to me
I'm no longer alone, though

Nothing's changed
And I see it more every day
Nothing moves
It's a game to be played and to lose

And now I'm heavy, unsteady
But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground
I might lift this up
To only be the one who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way to find some higher ground?
Before the waters rush
I've got to make a change or else I know I'll drown

Baby, look around
Door number two I've already walked through
I wanna see what's behind door number three
