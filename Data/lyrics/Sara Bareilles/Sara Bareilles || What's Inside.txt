Sugar, sugar, sugar, butter
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I'll take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe and bake from the heart

What's inside, everyone wants to know what's inside
And I've always told them, but I feel something needs to change

You wanna know what's inside?
I could tell you if I wasn't hiding
My whole life is in here 
In this kitchen, baking
What a mess I'm making
