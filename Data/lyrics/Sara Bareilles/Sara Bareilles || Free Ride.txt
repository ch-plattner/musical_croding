
Look how you're standing there
There with your hands out
Standing next to the road that goes up 
Running your mouth about how you're gonna wait for the one that comes down
Who do you think you are? Somebody's baby?
You want what everyone has but you want your name on it
Think it happens like that? That would be nice wouldn't it
I've gotta be careful of you
I wanna get there too

You wanna go, but you want a free ride
You want it in but standing on the outside
I'm not the one to call when it comes undone
You want the world, but don't wanna pay out
Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right 
There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride

You say your turn is coming and that's what you told me
So you stand in one place and wait for the tunnel to light up your face and award you for what you haven't done
And I know it's out of my hands
But I had to pay with blood, sweat, and tears while you dare to say that your lucky days passed you

You wanna go, but you want a free ride
You want it in, but standing on the outside
I'm not the one to call when it comes undone
You want the world, but don't wanna pay out
Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right 
There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride

I see you when the lights rise up
You want some too
How could anyone blame you
I see you when the lights rise up
You want some too
How could anyone blame you

You wanna go, but you wanna free ride
You wanna go, but you wanna free ride
You wanna go, but you wanna free ride
You want it in, but standing on the outside
I'm not the one to call when it comes undone
You want the world, but don't wanna pay out
Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right
There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride

Waiting on a free ride
Waiting on a free ride
Since you've been gone
