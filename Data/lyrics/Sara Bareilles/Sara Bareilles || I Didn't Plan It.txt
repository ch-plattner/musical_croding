Go ahead
Throw your rocks at me
From your little glass house
And then take off running
You're no better than me
We've both made mistakes intentionally

And I won't do what you keep doing
Sit in judgment of a house I ruined
I don't claim to be proud
But my head wont be hung in shame
I didn't plan it
But the light turned red, and I ran it
And I'm still standing
It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here

I understand it
A story written by my own hand
It's life biting right at your heels
I didn't plan it
But it's finally something to feel
Oh

Look around you
Ain't no saints here baby
We're all just looking for a little less crazy
And sometimes it's a hard left turn
Down a road you'd never thought you'd see
Don't you think dealing blame is a hazard
I'm not the only one whose dark side has her

I didn't plan it
Taking back what's been taken for granted
'Cause I can't stand it
I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free
I needed saving
And a good mistake needed making
Maybe you need the same thing

I didn't plan it
Taking back what's been taken for granted
I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free
I didn't plan it
But it's finally something to feel
Something to feel
