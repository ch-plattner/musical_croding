
Bound for the blessing 
You wouldn't see it coming 
I keep you guessing 
Watch while you come undone 

You were an island 
No one would dare to tread upon 
I came in like the wise men 
Ask you to take my gift of love 

Hold me responsible 
It's all my fault, I want 
You to hold me any way you can 
Hold me accountable 
It's all my fault, I want 
You to hold me any way you can 

Careful confessions 
Can't scare you with my crime 
I learned my lesson 
Love you a little at a time 

Losing my patience 
Getting acquainted with the edge 
Ready and waiting 
Happy to stand convicted 

Hold me responsible 
It's all my fault, I want 
You to hold me any way you can 
Hold me accountable 
It's all my fault, I want 
You to hold me any way you can 

I can't change you 
When you won't change yourself 
See you slowly becoming someone else 
I can't blame you for the strength you lack 
Scared to give me what you may not get back 

Hold me responsible 
It's all my fault, I want
You to hold me any way you can
Hold me responsible 
It's all my fault, I want
You to hold me any way you can 
Hold me accountable 
It's all my fault, I want 
You to hold me any way you can 
Anyway you can
