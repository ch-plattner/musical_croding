
I'm...
Making my way down this road,
Feel the chill to the road,
And I can barely see the lights,
Wonder if she'll be here tonight.

When I see her in my dreams,
There's flowers blooming these are the tree's,
Been searching for so long, yeah,
I think it's bout time that I found this girl.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me gooo.

Life will pass you by so quick,
I didn't know it but my line is growing thick,
And now I think I found the one, yeah,
That I've been searching for so long.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me gooo.

Just push the roads aside,
Wanted to see you smile,
And now I'm feeling so strong,
Done walking down this road,
Got what I want.

And you're coming with me.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me go.
