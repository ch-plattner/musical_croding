
Takin it slow
Isn't easy if as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know
Yeah

Comin out from above
A little something
And it's only because
I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know

That you've been
Coming off strong lately
And I can feel it that
You been thinking that maybe
You got a, another shot at me
Thinking possibly
Somehow, but not now

And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder
That's beatin my head to the ground
But I
I know

That I can't go back,
To this,
To her,
To what we used to have

It's black and burns,
My God this is so sad
It'll only make things worse,
If we bring it back
Woah, yeah yeah, ohhhh

And I mean if you believe,
That there is something still between you and me
And baby honestly, yeah
You're not the one for me

And I can't go back,
To this,
To her,
To what we used to have.

It's black and burns,
My God this is so sad,
It'll only makes things worse,
(If we bring it back) [x4]

If we bring it,
Back.
