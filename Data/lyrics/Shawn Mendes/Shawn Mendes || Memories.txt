
When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a sound that sounds so simple
Yet dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our songs
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And we'll write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our songs
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

Memories after all
Memories after all

You gave me all
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go

It's deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go
I've got to let go, no

Read all our stories
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall

All those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are all the memories after all

Memories after all
