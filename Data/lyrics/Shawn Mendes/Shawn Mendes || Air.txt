[Shawn:]
Never thought that we would end up here,
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me,
But we're trying way too hard

[Astrid:]
Used to think that we would last forever,
How could I've been so wrong
Never thought I'd be the one to say this,
What if our time has come and gone?

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]

[Astrid:]
Always tryna put your two cents in
Then expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken,
All you do is leave me stained

[Shawn:]
Told you not to tie me down too quickly,
Take it slow it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in but,
All I really need is space

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]
Air [12x]

[Shawn:]
Trying to hold me down
But I'm surfacing
It's hard to let you go,
But I gotta leave

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, I'm coming up for air

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]
Air [12x]
