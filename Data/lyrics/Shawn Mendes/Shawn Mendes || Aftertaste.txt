Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies I'll be fine I know where I'm headed
Probably should've known

And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me."
Fool me once, told you twice you're gonna regret it
Now you're all alone, yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

Close your eyes, you can't hide
Try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets
you weren't ready when you left me there

And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me." Yeah
Bet it hurts, it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts, 'cause...

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste
And the aftertaste
