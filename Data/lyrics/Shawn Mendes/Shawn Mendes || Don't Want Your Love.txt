
We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while girl
Our love is on trial (you run wild, you run wild)
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
Cause everything that I do is never ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud (you run wild, you run wild, yeah)

[Chorus:]
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

I'm not asking for much, I'm just tryna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss
I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild

[Chorus]

That's it it's now or never, I can't do this forever
Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it it's now or never, I can't do this forever
Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild

[Chorus x2]
