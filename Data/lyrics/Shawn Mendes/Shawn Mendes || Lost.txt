Is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
I sit in your room with nothing to do
Victim to the screen between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost

We go out to shows but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screen on our phones?
If we're all here together then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tips of our fingers
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost

Tell me how it feels cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark

I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
[x2]

I wanna get lost, I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost
