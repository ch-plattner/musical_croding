So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will, make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave tomorrow

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
And act like you love me, so I can go on
And act like you love me, so I can go on

Just one more night
Laying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning
And you'll be over this
Just one more night, so I can forget

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
And act like you love me, so I can go on
And act like you love me, so I can go on

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
And act like you love me, so I can go on
And act like you love me, so I can go on
Just act like you love me, so I can go on
