Everest is only a mountain
A pyramid is just a shape
Doesn't have to hold you back
Doesn't have to pin you down

Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true
Everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Don't be afraid to be who you are
Just dream out and shout and follow the stars
Forget about the past that it's over
We are the young ones our way is forward

Who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes?
We all mess up but that's just the way
We learn how to get back up
We learn how to turn the page

So we will let our dreams take flight
And our hearts ignite

Did you know that it's true
Everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true
That everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
