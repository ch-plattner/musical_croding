Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Play the lotto you might win it.
It's like 25 to life so you bust out of prison.

Something's in the air, something's in the air

It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it,
Take your last shot you know you're gonna hit it.

Something's in the air, something's in the air

Whoa oh oh oh oh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like

Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Something big

It's like that feeling when you're 'bout to win the medal,
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle,
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.

When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen,
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing,

Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.

Whoa oh oh oh oh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control,
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like,

Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh
Something big

Whoa
Yeah, yeah

If we stomp our feet,
The ground will shake
If we clap our hands,
The walls will break
Yell so loud won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening

Take this spark
And start a fire
Raise this up
We're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like

Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Something big is happening whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening oh
