
Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes, it's hard to stand out
And you, don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
Ooh, woah, oh

You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd, came, and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Ooh, woah, yeaah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
Cause I don't even know your name

Oh, everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone
Yeah, I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah, I don't even know your name

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking
'Till I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking
'Till I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
Cause I don't even know your name.
