
Out of my face
I don't know your name
As time goes by
You're the same

The last time that you saw me
I didn't even care
The next time that I saw you
It was me who stood and stared

I'm out of sight
You're out of mind
I'm out of sight
You're out of mind 

Hangin' in the bar
Loud rockin' noise
You have a Chevy
I guess it's your choice

You really thought you had me
Thought you put me in my place
You were super cool in high school
But now I'm in your face

I'm out of sight
You're out of mind
I'm out of sight
You're out of mind

You tell me you got a wife
I heard she's fat
You got a kid
And I got a cat

You really thought you had me
Thought you put me in my place
You were super cool in high school 
But now I'm in your face

I'm out of sight
You're out of mind
I'm out of sight
You're out of mind
