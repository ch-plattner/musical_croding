
Come on and show me
Just what you mean to me
Come on and show me
Your daily atrophy
Come on and show me
Just what I mean to you
Come on and show me
Just what you are
Come on and hold me
Just like you used to do
Come on and squeeze me
When I make love with you
Come on and show me
I picked out who you are
Come on and blame me
I like it now

Come on and stroke me
Just like you whip your bat
Come on and show me
I ain't seen nothing yet
Come on and show me
I don't know where I'll go
Come on and show me
I wanna know!
