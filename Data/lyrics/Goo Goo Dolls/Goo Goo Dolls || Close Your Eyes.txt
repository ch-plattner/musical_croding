
I wish I had a saxophone 
I'd play the blues 'til you came home 
With a little sadness in your eyes

Now that all my time was spent 
In the walk your heaven sent 
Thinking 'bout all the nights you cried

Had a certain passion 
And I had silly dreams 
A look of vicious actions
Don't close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me
Oh, don't close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me

I wish I had a camera lens 
To film the things my mind had said 
Before they reached my mouth and got all bad 

Looking at the skies of blue 
All day long, I think of you 
Even after all the shit we've been through 

Had a certain passion 
And I had silly dreams 
A look of vicious actions 
Don't close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me 
Please don't close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me 
Oh, don't close your eyes to me 
Close your eyes to me 
Close your eyes to me 
Eyes to me 
Close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me 
Close your eyes to me 
Close your eyes to me 
Don't close your eyes to me 
Eyes to me
