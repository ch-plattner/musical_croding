I hate to be a nuisance here
But I've been waiting half a year to say
You're bringing on the light
The second hand moves way to slow
Where did all those minutes go
I say, you're bringing on the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light

There's no right way to do
A wrong thing, I could hear you say
You're bringing on the right
We'll theres a quick trip there and I'm on return
So make the grade or feel the burn
You say, you're bringing on the light

Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light

There's a little place we used to go
It took the place of what we didn't know
It's like a magic show
Separating lies from fact
Oh, what kind of fun is that
You're just waiting for your time back
Go!

Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, bringing on the light

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Bringing on the light
