Oh, the storm is threatening 
My very life today. 
If I don't get some shelter 
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away 
It's just a shot away 
War, children, it's just a shot away 
It's just a shot away

See the fire sweepin' 
Our very streets today 
Burns like a red coal carpet 
Mad bull lost its way

War, children, it's just a shot away 
It's just a shot away 
War, children, it's just a shot away 
It's just a shot away

Well, murder 
It's just a shot away 
Well, murder 
It's just a shot away 

Brother, sister 
It's just a kiss away 
Well, murder 
It's just a kiss away, a kiss away, a kiss away
