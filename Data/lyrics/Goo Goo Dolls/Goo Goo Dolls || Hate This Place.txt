
Gone away
Who knows where you been
But you take all your lies
And wish them all away

I somehow doubt
We'll ever be the same
There's too much poison
And confusion on your face

Can you feel it?
I didn't mean it
Can I see you?
What are we doin'?
I think I love you
But I ain't sayin'
Nothin' you don't know

Hold on dreamaway
You're my sweet charade

Take your time
Move yourself to me
Yeah, I can take your lies
Until you fall away

You know I'm lost
Hiding in your bed
No, I don't think it's wrong
It's just gone to my head

Can you feel it?
I didn't mean it
Can I see you?
What are we doin'?
I think I love you
But I ain't sayin'
Nothin' you don't know

Hold on dreamaway
You're my sweet charade

Hey, whatcha do to me?
Would you come back to me?
Yeah, I can't do another day
I'm not certain of it anyway
I ain't messin' with another life
Can I get along without you?
Tell me the lies that you know I need

Hold on dreamaway
You're my sweet charade

Hold on dreamaway
You're my sweet charade

Hold on dreamaway
Hold on dreamaway
