I look outside my window,e verything was blanketed in white 
The neighbors pushing cars out from snow that fell on us last night 
Started thinking 'bout the things we used to do when we were young 
Back when things were simple, getting up was fun

I couldn't care, cuz I'm already there 
I'm already there, and I'm ready there

Turn around and face the clock 
I sit and watch, as time went hoppin' by 
I'm still growing up, my friends are growing old before my eyes 
Count the stars above, wonder when the heavens will subside 
Knowing our two worlds will someday just collide

I couldn't care, cuz I'm already there 
I'm already there, and I'm ready there

Just a boy who's young at heart, his smile was a bit like yours today 
Had a wife, a kid, some strife, never had to go astray 
Happiness evolved, life was in full swing at 17
All the things he wanted were things he'd never seen

It don't seem fair, cuz I'm already there 
I'm already there, and I'm ready there
