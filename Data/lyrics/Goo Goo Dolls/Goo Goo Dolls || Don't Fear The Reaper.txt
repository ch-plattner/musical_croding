All our time has come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
(We can be like they are)

Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man

All our time has gone
Here but now it's gone

Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
(Romeo and Juliet)
Forty thousand men and women everyday
(Like Romeo and Juliet)
Forty thousand men and women everyday
(Redefine happiness)
Another forty thousand coming everyday
(We can be like they are)

Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly 
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby, I'm your man
