
If I could walk a straight mile
And could write it down in shorthand, I could show you 
If you want me to 
And if I had an hourglass 
I'd save the grains of time I spent with you 
That's what I'd do

But I remember
You always said it could be great 
And I knew it could be

Well there's a way you look at things 
That no one needs to know but you 
And you'd shout it with me 
Like every time the leaves would fall 
You promised me that they'd be back again 
And I believed in you

You always said it could be great 
But I hadn't time to waste 
Now it seems that I've gone too far

As bright as you are, don't get burned by your lucky star 
Bright as you are, don't get burned by your lucky star

Written down in hard bound books 
The way things used to be, they ain't for me 
I'd swear they're all for you 
We said sugar, Gramps said shoot
Her momma said shit, I don't know what she'll do
As if it's up to you

But I remember
You always said it could be great 
But I hadn't time to waste 
Now it seems that I've gone too far

As bright as you are, don't get burned by your lucky star 
Bright as you are, don't get burned by your lucky star

Your lucky star will burn out 
Your lucky star can turn you 'round 
Your lucky star will burn out 
Your lucky star can turn you 'round 
Turn you 'round, turn you 'round, turn you 'round 
They're gonna turn you around
