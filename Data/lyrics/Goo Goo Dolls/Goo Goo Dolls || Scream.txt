
See me scream a thousand screams
Every time I start to dream
Scream and dream of my little love
Oh, I gotta find my glove

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

See me think then you interrupt
Wrap it up, put me back in my trunk
Turned ill from this hatred fifty times
Oh we're goin' down in my screamin' mind

I lie awake in a cold, cold sweat
Rolling around in the sheets and screaming wet
Oh my God, here it comes
Another dream, another, another one

[Robby screams here for a while]
