
And I didn't think about
All the ways I hurt you and myself
And I hide
Wouldn't say a thing to you
I keep it to myself and my mind
I can't stand without you
And I won't find the answers when you're gone

But it's over to you
And I can't find the answers when you're gone
And it's over to you
And you can't find the answer where you are

And you know
(And you know)
I need you now
This ain't easy to admit
And no one needs to know
What goes on behind the door in my room
I'm peeking through the walls in my mind
And I can't stand without you
I won't find the answers when you're gone

But it's over to you
And I can't find the answers when you're gone
And it's over to you
And you can't find the answers where you are

I will tear you down
I will tear you down
To get into the world you wanted
I'm kicking through the wall
No one can believe in things that never change

[Chorus]

And it's over to you
And I can't find the answers when you're gone
And I can't find the answers when you're gone
And I can't find the answers when you're gone
