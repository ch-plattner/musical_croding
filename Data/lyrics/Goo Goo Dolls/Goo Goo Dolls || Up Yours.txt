Up yours
Stop your whine
Feelin' swell
And I'm doin' fine

Yeah, fuck your suicide
It's all bullshit cuz I tried
And it really don't impress me all that much

Up yours
What'd you find
Sit right down
I got time

And you say here comes the end 
And you haven't got a friend
And I'm standing here just screaming at the wall

Up yours 
Stop your whine
Whatcha ya got
I got mine

And you shake your stupid head
And you wish that you were dead
And I swear sometimes you're happier than me

And you know it's hard to be
All the things you want me to be
And you go and make it hard on me
But I swear that anything you could be, I could be, can't you see 

Up yours
Got no mind
That's too bad
You got time

Yeah, fuck your silly game
Cuz it's driving me insane
And it really doesn't matter much to me
