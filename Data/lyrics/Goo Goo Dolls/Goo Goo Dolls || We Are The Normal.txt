
It's a beautiful day, I heard everybody say 
The sun shines down for all of us 
Just the same, you know I like the rain 
That ain't so obvious

It's a beautiful sight, I guess everybody's right 
This day belongs to all of us 
Even still, I like mine with a chill 
That ain't so obvious

We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why 
We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why

It's a beautiful life, and I've got it in my sights 
And that ain't for all of us 
It's a beautiful sound 
When my life comes crashin' down 
That ain't so obvious 
It's a beautiful sin, and I'm doin' it again 
And that ain't for all of us 
It's a beautiful life, and I've got it in my sights 
Ain't that so obvious?

We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why 
We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why

We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why 
We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why 
There's no reason why

We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why 
We are the normal 
We live and we die 
With no reason why
