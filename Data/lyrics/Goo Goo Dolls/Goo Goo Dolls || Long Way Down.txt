Oh, here you are
There's nothing left to say 
You're not supposed to be that way
Did they push you out?
Did they throw you away?

Touch me now and I don't care 
When you take me, I'm not there 
Almost human, but I'll never be the same

Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own 
Long way down
I don't want to live in here alone 
Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own

I never put you down
I never pushed you away 
You're not supposed to be that way 
And anything you want
There's nothing I could say

Is there anything to feel? 
Is it pain that makes you real?
Cut me off before it kills me

Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own 
Long way down
I don't want to live in here alone 
Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own 
I never put you down
I never pushed you away
Take another piece of me 
Give my mind a new disease 
And the black and white world never fades to grey

Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own 
Long way down
I don't want to live in here alone 
Long way down
I don't think I'll make it on my own
On my own
On my own
