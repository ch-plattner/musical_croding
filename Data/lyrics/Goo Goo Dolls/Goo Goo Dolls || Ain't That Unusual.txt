Could you talk to me
Honestly
Cuz I never heard a word you said now 
And I ain't just being mean

Cuz all we are is what we're told 
And most of that's been lies 
It's like a made-for-TV movie 
And I just blew my line

Someday you never made it Maybe you never will 
Hey, you never made it 
Now, ain't that unusual?

Now I feel unknown 
And it's safe that way 
Are you too bored to care or too dumb to be scared, now
Now what's that supposed to mean?

I'm burned out on some empty reasons 
Another waste of time 
It's somethin' that I wish I'd said 
But I don't think it'd rhyme

Someday you never made it 
Maybe you never will 
Hey, you never made it 
Now, ain't that unusual?

See I'd love to be you 
At least then I'd see you 
Sorry I put them words in your mouth 
But you wouldn't talk to me 

You're everything I want and haven't got
I'm sick of everything I'm not 
Put my heavy coat on for a while 
It's freezing in the corner of my mind

Someday you never made it 
Maybe you never will 
Hey, you never made it 
Now, ain't that unusual?
