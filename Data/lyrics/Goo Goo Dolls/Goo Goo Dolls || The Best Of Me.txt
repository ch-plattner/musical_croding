
How long should I wait here?
With my hand out for you to hold?
'Cause I've chased your forgiveness
Now I'm falling to my knees

And I was so young, so blind, selfish, still green, unkind,
Too quick to leave us behind.

Ain't seen the best of me yet
Ain't seen the best of me yet
Broke down and built myself again
We tried so hard to forget
Lived half our lives in regret
How long before you make us whole again?
How long? How long? How long?

Had you, then I lost you
If only I knew what I know now
'Cause I know if you touched me
That you would still feel the fires there

And I was so young, so blind, selfish, still green, unkind,
Too quick to leave us behind.

Ain't seen the best of me yet
Ain't seen the best of me yet
Broke down and built myself again
We tried so hard to forget
Lived half our lives in regret
How long before you make us whole again?
How long? How long? How long

Human in all my mistakes
Show me divine, show me grace
Just give it a one last thing
Just give it a one last thing

Ain't seen the best of me yet
Ain't seen the best of me yet
Broke down and built myself again
We tried so hard to forget
Lived half our lives in regret
How long before you make us whole again?
How long? How long? How long
