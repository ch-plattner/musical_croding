
Being afraid can be okay, if you're willing to let things go
If you'd lay me to die and try to learn what you don't know
I don't know why I drive behind the wheel
Sun's the sky, and I was

On the road to salinas
Down the road I thought could free us
Ordinary dreams would go, and I would always get back home

Took the time inside to find the boy inside my brain
Someone waited out on him and was trying to get away
I don't know why I feel the way I feel
Sun's in the sky, and I was

On the road to salinas
Down the road I thought could free us
Ordinary dreams would go, and I would always get back home

See myself in someone else, and I just don't know why
When I lay my head to sleep I lay awake and cry
I don't know why I drive behind the wheel
Sun's in the sky, and I was

On the road to salinas
Down the road I thought could free us
Ordinary dreams would go, and I would always get back home
