
Hey
What are you thinking
I tried to reach your face
Say
See what you're thinking
Don't carry around that pain

Everytime I see you
Picking at yourself
I love
I love when things worked out

Smash
I heard you crying
Seven times this year
Crash
'Cause now you're smilin'
Holding back those tears

Every time I see you
Picking at yourself
I love
I love when things worked out

Every time I see you
Torturing yourself
I love
I love when things worked out

I see it from another place right now
I'm coming home before I hit the ground
Run fast there I wanna be gone now

Smash
And I feel it
Smash
And I feel it
Smash
And I feel it
Right now
