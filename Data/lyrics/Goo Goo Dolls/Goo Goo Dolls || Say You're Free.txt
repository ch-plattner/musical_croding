
I caught you stealing things you knew I'd give
but nothing seems to matter in your life
I come around to when I go to miss,
but nothing seems to matter here tonight

And it's sad, I'm sorry
Guess you're going blind

Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight this might just mean the world to me
Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight, this might just mean the world

Well aware of what the answer is,
but nothing means enough to fill that space
I'm still depending on the life of it
but honestly, it feels like such a shame

And it's sad, I'm sorry
Guess you're going blind

Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight this might just mean the world to me
Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight, this might just mean the world

Follow superstitions close,
they never fade away you know
Your horoscope, your love is stoned
Let them go now, let them go

Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight this might just mean the world to me
Say you're free now, say you're free
cause' tonight, this might just mean the world to me

Say you're free now, say you're free now
Say you're free now
