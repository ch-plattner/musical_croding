
If you never had it then
You don't know how bad it is
There is nothing like it, well
Needless talk, then, I can tell but

Here comes the day I sit and wait... (Dominoes are falling still)
Oh, it's always something
The bills keep coming, the car ain't running... (As I know they always will)
Now I'm bummin' home again
Another day, oh, the mailman's on his way... (Dominoes, a test of will)
Just sit and wait
Always ponderin' my fate too late... (Dominoes)
And then the day goes

I bought them from you yesterday
Little buts til you ask me
No one minds, I can tell
Seems I've hid the ones you shall, but

Here comes the day I sit and wait... (Dominoes are falling still)
Oh, it's always something
The bills keep coming, the car ain't running... (As I know they always will)
Now I'm bummin' home again
Another day, oh, the mailman's on his way... (Dominoes, a test of will)
Just sit and wait
Always ponderin' my fate too late... (Dominoes)
And then the day goes

Dominoes are falling still... (Oh, every day)
As I know they always will... (I sit and wait)
Dominoes, a test of will... (That's why I'm pondering my fate too late)
Dominoes... (And then the day goes)
