
Brand new Goo Goo Dolls!

See me in a different light
I think it'll be okay
Why are you so blind that you
Can only see today

See me in a different space 
That you'd expect to see
Then maybe you'd be taken in by
Everything close to me

See me with a different face
That I've had in my past
Criticize the other jerks
Who make this madness last

See me in a different light
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)

See me in a different light
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)
See me in a different light
(You're so blind)
