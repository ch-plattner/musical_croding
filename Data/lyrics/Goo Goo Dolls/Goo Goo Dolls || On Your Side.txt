I'm on a mission, baby,
I'm not hearin' what you're sayin'
Stop preaching at me now
I'm not a revelation,
Superstar or new sensation
I'm just hidin' away my frowns

Oh no
We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side

Five a.m. I shut my eyes
Then my worries tranquilized
Don't think the morning comes too soon

If I don't see the morning,
That's okay, they're pretty boring
See you tomorrow afternoon

Oh no
We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side

We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side

You're livin' in a trailer
Friends all think that you're a failure
But are you thinkin' for yourself?
You read the Sunday paper
Wife's pissed off cuz you ain't laid her
Rolling pennies for your wealth

Me too
We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side

We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side

We don't see eye to eye
On your side
I'm on your side
With a smile and a sigh
On your side
I'm on your side
