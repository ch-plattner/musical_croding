
Stranger than your sympathy
And this is my apology
I'm killing myself from the inside out
And all my fears have pushed you out

And I wished for things that I don't need
(all I wanted)
And what I chase won't set me free
(it's all I wanted)
And I get scared but I'm not crawlin' on my knees

Oh, yeah
Everything's all wrong, yeah
Everything's all wrong, yeah
Where the hell did I think I was?

And stranger than your sympathy
I take these things, so I don't feel
I'm killing myself from the inside out
And now my head's been filled with doubt

It's hard to lead the life you choose
(all I wanted)
And all your luck's run out on you
(all I wanted)
And you can't see when all your dreams are coming true

Oh, yeah
It's easy to forget, yeah
When you choke on the regrets, yeah
Who the hell did I think I was?

And stranger than your sympathy
And all these thoughts you stole from me
And I'm not sure where I belong
And nowhere's home and I'm all wrong

And I was in love with things I tried to make believe I was
And I wouldn't be the one to kneel before the dreams I wanted
And all the talk and all the lies were all the empty things disguised as me

Mmm, yeah
Stranger than your sympathy
Stranger than your sympathy
Mmm hmmm mmm
