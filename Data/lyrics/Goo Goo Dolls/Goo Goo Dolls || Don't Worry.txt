
I called you up all night 'til mornin'
Left my house by noon today (and I saw you standing there) 
No one spoke but we both listened 
Heard every word you didn't say

And the sun shines all around us 
Smells like summer's on the way (and I saw you standing there) 
Tell the story of a lifetime 
Tomorrow brings a brand new day

Don't worry 'bout today (and the words that you said)
Don't worry 'bout today (shake the world from your head)
Least for a while

You see, the days keep getting longer
But my nights seem longer still (and my TV's off the air)
Watching repeats on my ceiling 
Another hour left to kill

Don't worry 'bout today (and the words that you said)
Don't worry 'bout today (shake the world from your head)
Least for a while
