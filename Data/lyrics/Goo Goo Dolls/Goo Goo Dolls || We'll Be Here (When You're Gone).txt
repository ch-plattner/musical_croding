
And through the fence I see a ghost
Of a place that used to breathe
You know it choked away the sun
But we still had food to eat

And now everyone is gone
To a place that won't be home
Can they keep their family strong?
Will they make it on their own?

And we'll be standing when you're gone
And we'll be heard again
We missed our chance but not for long
I know somehow we will hold on we'll be here
When you're gone

Then one day we realized
That they couldn't hear our voice
And it's so hard to understand 
When it's caught up in the noise

But the ones who fight and die
Are the truth inside the lie
Now it's all built on our backs
And we struggle to survive

And we'll be standing when you're gone
And we'll be heard again
We missed our chance but not for long
I know somehow we will hold on we'll be here
When you're gone
