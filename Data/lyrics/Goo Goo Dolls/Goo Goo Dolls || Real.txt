
You read the news
Turns you inside out
And everybody feels
The same as you
And uncertain times
The uncertain rules apply
Caught in the blind spot
Of mirrored love

Can you feel real like you are
Can you feel alive, the way I feel your light
And the biggest chance that we can take
Is open arms and wide awake
Hold me now so we can feel alive
Tonight

I need to feel you there
I want to know where I belong
And I felt the sting the sting of corrosion
I need a safe place to close my eyes

Can you feel real like you are?
Can you feel your life the way I feel your love
And the biggest chance that we can take
Is open arms and wide awake hold me now
So we can feel alive

Oh, we were so lost
And there was so much more than you could bear
And i was cold in my defeat
You're alone and incomplete
When the sound could break down the walls

Can you feel real like you are?
Can you feel your life the way I feel your love
And the biggest chance that we can take
Is open arms and wide awake
Hold me now
So we can feel alive
So I can feel alive
Tonight
