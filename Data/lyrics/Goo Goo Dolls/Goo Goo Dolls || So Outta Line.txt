I heard the floor creak, or so I thought
I had my head a-rubbin' on the ceiling
You said that indecision makes one weak
My indecision's suddenly been deepened

One day ain't forever
You'll find your time
You look outside, there's snow
Been snow so long, you know
Just feel like lettin' go
So outta line

You've worked so hard for everything you've got
Ten minutes later, you're a loser
Count your blessings and the ones you love
At this point, we beggars can't be choosers

One day ain't forever
You'll find your time
You look outside, there's snow
Been snow so long, you know
Just feel like lettin' go
So outta line

One day ain't forever
You'll find your time
You look outside, there's snow
Been snow so long, you know
Just feel like lettin' go
So outta line

One day ain't forever
One day ain't forever
