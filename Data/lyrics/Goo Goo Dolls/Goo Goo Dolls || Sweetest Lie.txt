
You play your part so easily
You fooled yourself again
With your lipstick smeared
Across some face you'll never see again

And I sat back in the corner
Working back my memories
And I wondered if the time would come
You'd get around to me

Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie
Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie

You made me feel electric
Every moment that we shared
But the lights went out when I realized
You never even cared

I picked myself back up
I didn't know where I had been
And the thing that makes you seem so wrong
Is I want you back again

Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie, yeah
Come on baby, give me love
Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie, yeah
Come on baby, give me love

You know you'll never be taken
Your love will never be taken now
I know you're tired of waking
I know you're tired of waking up

Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie, yeah
Come on baby, give me love
Oh oh, oh oh
Living the sweetest lie, yeah
Come on baby, give me love
