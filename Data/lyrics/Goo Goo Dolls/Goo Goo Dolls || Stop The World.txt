
You need someone to hold you 
You need somethin' that you ain't been getting 
Yeah, I could be the one 
To tell you what to do, but it don't mean nothing 
And you're holding on forever 
But that something just ain't true
I'm just like you 
And I know 
It's what I'd do 
Here I go

Cuz I couldn't stop the world, cuz I loved you 
I couldn't stop the world, and I don't want to 
I couldn't stop the world, and I won't 
Cuz it ain't enough

You had another bad day 
You let me know that you just can't take it 
I've given up on you 
You live in truth and I know I can't fake it 

Cuz the stars you see on dirty sidewalks
And they ain't for wishin', ooh
They don't come true 
And I know, it's what I'd do 
Here I go

Cuz I couldn't stop the world, cuz I loved you 
I couldn't stop the world, and I don't want to 
I couldn't stop the world, and I won't 
Cuz it ain't enough

Am I too young for the world?
I'm not too young for the world
And I can't change for the world
(I don't need to stop the world)
'Cause I don't care for the world
(I'm too young, I'm too young)
I don't make sense to the world
(I don't need to stop the world)
(I'm too young, I'm too young)
