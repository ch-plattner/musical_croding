[This song's lyrics vary, but they'll be on the same general lines as the ones show below]

A thousand words, but none were spoken
Guess there's nothing left to say
Another dream just got broken
Guess things just turn out that way, yeah

I want you to love me
Want you to know I'm just like you
Just like you
A thousand words were spoken
Another dream, another day, yeah

I want you to feel me
Want you to feel like I do
Like I do
A thousand words were spoken
Guess there's nothing left to say, yeah

I want you to <laughs>
Want you to know I'm just like you
I want you to fuck me
Want you to know I'm just like you
Just like you
Just like you
A thousand words just like you
A thousand words just like you
