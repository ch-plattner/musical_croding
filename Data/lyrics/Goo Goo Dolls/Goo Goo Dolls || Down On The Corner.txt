
Early on the evening, just about suppertime
Over by the courthouse, they're startin' to unwind
Poor kids on the corner tryin' to bring you up
Willie picks a tune out and he knows they gonna start

Down on the corner 
Out in the street
Willie and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel tap your feet

Johnny hits the washboard, people just gotta smile
Robby thumbs a gut-bass and solos for a while
Poor boy brings the rhythm on his kalamazoo
And Willie goes into a dance doubles on kazoo, hey!

Down on the corner 
Out in the street
Willie and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel tap your feet

Down on the corner 
Out in the street
Willie and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel tap your feet

Down on the corner 
Out in the street
Willie and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel tap your feet

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you got a nickel won't ya lay your money down
Over on the corner there's a happy noise 
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner 
Out in the street
Willie and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel tap your feet 

[fade out...]
