I thought about you just last Saturday
My voice got cracked, I didn't know what to say
Down in the shade, or maybe in the sun
And if you need it, I think I've got one

Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
Where are you?
Am I wasting my time?
Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
I just wanna know if I'm wasting my time.

I snuck out of work to see her smile
I'll hold her hostage for a little while
I wrote a letter, thought I'd let you know
I'm right behind you anytime you go.

Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
Where are you?
Am I wasting my time?
Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
I just wanna know if I'm wasting my time.

My mind got busy, 'round three a.m. or so
Crawled in your room through the back window
Hoped when you woke up, you wouldn't be too mad
I hope I never wake up your old man

Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
Where are you?
Am I wasting my time?
Where are you?
And what's on your mind?
I just wanna know if I'm wasting my time.
