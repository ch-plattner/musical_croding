
I've been where the river ran
I'm drownin' in a sunless sea
Sleep has helped me find my end
You promised me you'd set me free
Don't fall asleep to dream

A banshee's at my window pane
There's an angel at my feet
Don't fall asleep to dream 

I'm awake now 
(You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more)
I'm awake now 

In the corner of my mind 
Where he sits and waits for me
There's a wall of confusion building
And the sky begins to bleed on me 
Don't fall asleep to dream 

I'm looking for a way out now 
Peace of mind is all I need 
Don't fall asleep to dream 

I'm awake now 
(You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more)
I'm awake now 
(You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more)
I'm awake now 
(You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more)
I'm awake now 

I'm awake now 
I'm awake now 
I'm awake now 
I'm awake now
