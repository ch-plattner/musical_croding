
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

I feel it coming on again 
Just like it did before
They fill your mind with boredom
And they lead you off to war
The way we treat each other 
Really makes me feel ill
And if you're gonna fight
Then you're just dying to get killed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

A box upon the media
And everything you read
They tell you your opinions
And they're very good indeed

I wanna destroy you

And when I have destroyed you
I'll come pickin' at your bones
And you won't have a single atom
Left to call your own

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
Wanna destroy you
Wanna destroy you
Wanna destroy you
