
The world spins 'round the secret lives
Of everyone that needs to hide (yeah, hide)
A cheap parade of endless lies 
Filters through this lazy eye

And I don't believe in signs 
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown

Lose yourself in no one's life 
Trapped in nowhere's empty light (oh, light)
Words like fists that tear you down
Crash before we hit the ground

And I don't believe in signs 
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown

And I don't believe in signs 
No, I don't believe your lies 
No, I don't believe your lies

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown
