
Happy, smilin', cryin,
Outburst to my past.
I guess those stormy gray skies simply couldn't last.
And now I find myself a-tuggin' at your dress.
The fun of holdin' you down, or seein' you frown, is never gonna pass.

Somewhere there's a place a soul can never go,
Grey like stormy skies I hoped you didn't know.
All our postcards full of things I won't forget,
And now it's comin' down, that laughing clown is all I ever get.

Another second time around I've been runnin' from ya,
Another second time around.
Another second, one more second time I waited for ya,
Another second time around.

Couldn't help myself,
I felt like everything was gonna pass.
It was an awkward time,
I hoped it wouldn't, hoped it couldn't last.

And I didn't know exactly what to say,
'Bout the things you saw me do my evil way.
And I know you're lyin', cryin' in your bed,
Well I'm all tired out, so wired out, it's ringing in my head.

Another second time around I've been runnin' from ya,
Another second time around.
Another second, one more second time I waited for ya,
Another second time around.
Another second time around
Another second time around
