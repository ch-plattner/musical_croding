You're cynical and beautiful
You always make a scene
You're monochrome delerious
You're nothing that you seem
I'm drownin' in your vanity
Your laugh is a disease
You're dirty and you're sweet
You know you're everything to me

Everything you are
Falls from the sky like a star
Everything you are
Whatever ever you want

I wanna kick at the machine
That made you piss away you dreams
And tear at your defenses
'Til there's nothing there but me
You're angry when you're beautiful
Your love is such a tease
I'm drowning in your dizzy noise
I wanna feel you scream

Everything you are
Falls from the sky like a star
Everything you are
Whatever ever you want

Everything you are
Falls from the sky like a star
Everything you are
Whatever ever you want

Everything you are
Whatever ever you want
Whatever ever you want
Whatever ever you want
