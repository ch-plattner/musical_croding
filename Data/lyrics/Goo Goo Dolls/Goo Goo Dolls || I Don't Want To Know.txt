
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't understand you and me, baby
I, I just want you to be mine

Finally baby
The truth has come down now
And now you listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud now

Tryin' to believe, yeah
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rockin, and a-reelin,
Oh, oh, oh

And I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't understand you and me, baby
I, I just want you to be mine
Wanna make you be mine

Finally, baby
The truth has been told
And now you tell me that I'm crazy
Now, it's nothing that I didn't know

Tryin' to survive now
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rockin' and a-reelin'
Oh...

And I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't understand you and me, baby
I, I just want you to be mine
Make you to be mine

Tryin' to believe in
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rockin' and a-reelin'
Oh...

I don't want to know the reason why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't understand you and me
Baby, I, I just want you to be mine
Make you to be mine

Gonna make you to be mine
Gonna make you to be mine
Wanna make you to be mine
Oh, won't you be mine, mine, mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you make up your mind?
