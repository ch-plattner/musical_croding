You whispered in my mouth
And I spit you words right back 
How good do you think I'll look 
When the words start to break and crack?

You beat your head upon your wall 
You disconnect yourself from it all 
Cuz you know that you're so beautiful and so untouchable 
And I want to get in so bad, and I don't know how 
No, I don't know how

Cuz you're gone, and you ain't coming back 
Yeah you're gone, and you ain't coming back 

You held your hand so close 
And I just can't push you away 
I wished you could be my girl 
But you're stuck in a grown up world 

You beat your head upon your wall 
You disconnect yourself from it all 
Cuz you know that you're so beautiful and so untouchable 
And I want to get in so bad, and I don't know how 
No I don't know how

Cuz you're gone, and you ain't coming back 
Yeah you're gone, and you ain't coming back 

You beat your head upon your wall 
You disconnect yourself from it all 
Cuz you know that you're so beautiful and so untouchable 
And I want to get in so bad, and I don't know how 
And I don't know how

Cuz you're gone, and you ain't coming back 
Yeah you're gone, and you ain't coming back 
Yeah you're gone, and I wish you'd come back
