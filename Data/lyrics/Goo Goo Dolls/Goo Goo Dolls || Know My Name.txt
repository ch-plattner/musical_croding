What kind of situation have I brought upon myself?
Some kind of bad reaction, blamed it all on someone else

Oh well
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before

You got me laughing at me, laughing all by myself
I had a drink on Friday, heard the news from someone else

Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before

You've got me running, running far from myself
You've got me coming, coming home to someone else

Oh well
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before

I tried to find the truth but every word I said came back

Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before

Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
Don't pretend like you know my name
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
