
It's getting near dawn
The lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll stay with you, darling, soon
I'll stay with you 'til the seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

Be with me, my love
The light shining through on you
Be with me, my love
It's the morning and just we two

I'll stay with you, darling, soon
I'll stay with you 'til the seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

Be with me, my love
The light shining through on you
Be with me, my love
It's the morning and just we two

I'll stay with you, darling, soon
Oh, 'til the seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
In the sunshine of your love

In the sunshine of your love
Let me do it again!
