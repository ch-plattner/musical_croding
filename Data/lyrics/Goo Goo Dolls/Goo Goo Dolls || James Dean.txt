Look around outside 
Ain't nothing to do but hang around 
Think about all the stupid things that I've done 
I guess I ain't nothin' but a clown

If I had a wish, I swear I'd wish, I'd wish for just one thing 
And I don't even like to think about all the things my wish'd bring

Cuz I just wanna be James Dean 
I just wanna be James Dean 
I just wanna be James Dean 
For a day

I wanna be oversexed and underworked and look at me I'm such a jerk

And I just wanna be James Dean 
For a day 

Think about stories of the actors and the movies stars 
Sittin' here watchin' the old men drinkin' at the bar 
I think about Dean and all the things he should've tried 
I think about Dean and all the ways he could've died 
Yeah, died

And I wouldn't give a shit about anything cuz I'd be such a big movie star 
And that don't really do me much good just cryin' at the bar

But I just wanna be James Dean 
I just wanna be James Dean 
I just wanna be James Dean 
For a day 

See but I'm overworked and undersexed and look at me I'm such a wreck

And I just wanna be James Dean 
For a day

Going crazy cuz I'm always all alone 
Going crazy no one calls me on the phone 
I think about Dean and I know Dean he wouldn't care 
If I was Dean I know there'd be somebody there 
Yeah, there'd be somebody there 
For me

Yeah I think about all the really cool things I could do and say 
Then you go and tell me that you found out Dean was gay...

No, I don't wanna be James Dean 
I don't wanna be James Dean 
I don't wanna be James Dean 
Anymore
