
If I leave today, don't know where to go that I can stay
I know what I need, but I won't follow, I can't lead 

And when I stood there and I felt November chill
You crushed my heart, and I really lost my will
You think you understand the way it made me feel
I started to choke on you, cuz I know what you fear

Cuz I've had enough, and I don't really need it
Had enough, and I don't really feel it
Had enough, but you really can't see it
But you'll see it for the first time in your life

If you had a brain, you'd be smart enough to change
Watch yourself, the thoughts of you plague no one else

And I stood there and I felt November chill
You broke my heart, and I really lost my will
You try to understand the way you make me feel
I started to choke on you, and I know what you fear

Cuz I've had enough, and I don't really need it
Had enough, and I don't really feel it
Had enough, but you really can't see it
But you'll see it for the first time in your life

Cuz I've had enough, and I don't really need it
Had enough, and I don't really feel it
Had enough, but you really can't see it
But you'll see it for the first time in your life

Cuz I've had enough, and I don't really need it
Had enough, and I don't really feel it
Had enough, but you really can't see it
But you'll see it for the first time in your life
