
I'm in love because I know you
And I'm sorry I don't show you
And if I find that you ain't by me
Afraid no one know the things you see

How could you believe in someone sorry-sad like me?
I know the deal and I thank you anyway
And if you leave, you know I'm crawlin' at your feet
You never get weak when I'm leanin' hard on you

But I guess that's just the way you are
And I guess it's just the way you are
Well, I guess it's just the way you are
Well, I guess it's just the way you are

And all the things that you don't show me
Like when you pretend that you don't know me
I waste a dime and I can't call you
I spend a lifetime if I fall for you

How could you believe in someone sorry-sad like me?
I know the deal and I thank you anyway
And if you leave, you know I'm crawlin' at your feet
You never get weak when I'm leanin' hard on you

But I guess that's just the way you are
And I guess it's just the way you are
Well, I guess it's just the way you are
Well, I guess it's just the way you are

Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
