
I know your strong
And it's so hard to see
You're staring right at me
When your struggling through the happiest of days

And what you're feeling know
Feels so wrong somehow
Still we're struggling through the happiest of days
You'll say

I didn't see it like the rest of us
Having to keep things to myself
And everyday there's something fooling me again
But I'm understanding
It's clear

Well if it keeps you from crying
It brings you back trying now
I should've mentioned
With varied attention now
