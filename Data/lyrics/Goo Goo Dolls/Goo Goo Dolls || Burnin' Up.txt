Said you're burnin' up inside and no one seems to tell 
You're living from a personalized manual from hell 

Life is pretty easy when it's from my easy chair 
And you're burnin' up inside and no one cares

Said you had enough this time cuz time don't treat you well 
You always cried coincidence, while I drew parallels

Life, it seems so easy when it's from my easy chair 
And you're burnin' up inside, burnin' up inside
Burnin' up inside and you hurt me
(Really hurt me)
(Oh, you hurt me)

Try to take my hand tonight, I'll show you where to start 
Cuz every word that left your lips is like a needle through my heart 

And life, it seems so easy when it's from my easy chair 
And you're burnin' up inside, burnin' up inside
Burnin' up inside and you hurt my eyes
(Cuz you're burnin' up inside) 
Hurt my eyes 
(Cuz you're burnin' up inside) 
Hurt my eyes 
(Cuz you're burnin' up inside)
Hurt my eyes
