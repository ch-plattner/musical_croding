Flat top intervention 
Bringin' home the new invention 
See it there in pieces on the ground

A television war between the cynics and the saints 
Flip the dial and that's whose side you're on
A-sleeping on the White House lawn ain't never changed a thing 
Just look at all the washed out Hippie dreams

And it's fallin' all around us 
Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us? 
Fallin' all around us 
I'll turn my head off for a while

The tabloid generation's lost 
Choking on it's fear 
Used to be that's all we had to fear

And conscience keeps us quiet while the crooked love to speak 
There's knowledge wrapped in blankets on the street
A visionary coward says that anger can be power 
As long as there's a victim on TV

And it's fallin' all around us 
Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us? 
Fallin' all around us 
I'll turn my head off for a while

And my dirty dreams all come alive on my TV screen 
And assasination plots show me what I haven't got 
Show me what I love, and who I'm supposed to be 
Show me everything I need 
Show it all to me 
Show it all to me

And it's fallin' all around us 
Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us? 
Fallin' all around us 
I'll turn my head off for a whi-i-i-i-ile
