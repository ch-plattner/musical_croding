I don't wanna lie around with this feeling anymore
Every time you push me you just push me out the door
And I don't wanna stand up, when I'm by your side
For you to make your silly mind, instead you won't

Laughing love doll
Boy, you're so proud
Love is sold out

Every time I look into your sad, pathetic face
I don't even wanna restore your faith in the human race
And I don't wanna stand up, around no more
For you to walk right out, walk right out, walk out the door

Laughing love doll
Boy, you're so proud
Love is sold out

Laughing love doll
Boy, you're so proud
Love is sold out
