
Yeah, it's Saturday night
Will I see you around?
I'm comin' to life
Didn't take a long, long time
Still where she was comin' from
Well, she took the long way around
And I've only come this far

Now, nothing can change you
When you feel foreign to love
Your world has a strange view
Can you tell me things that you're dreaming of?

Stop fallin' in love
With everything that lets you down
There's someone above
And I know she wears glasses
Sometimes she says it helps her mood
I see her in the long ride home
I guess I never spoke too soon

Now, nothing can change you
When you feel foreign to love
Your world has a strange view
Can you tell me things that you're dreaming of?

You don't wanna get left behind
You wanna find some piece of mind
You say it takes a long time there
She was there, she was in the crowd

You went rollin' along
When everybody wants to ride
Now Joe's never home
Nothing at the tableside
Where everything is chained to you know that
You're wakin' up to die inside
Now there's nowhere left to go

Now nothing can change you
When you feel foreign to love
Your world has a strange view
And you tell me things that you love

Now nothing can change you
When you feel foreign to love
Your world has a strange view
And you tell me things that you're dreaming of?
