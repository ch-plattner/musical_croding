
I see her every morning
In the middle of the street.
The "suits" don't even notice,
They're staring at their feet.

She hears a secret choir
That sings for me and you.
You know I don't believe her
But I say I hear them too.

Angel,
You're bulletproof,
You're so high,
You see the truth.
And I'm still on the ground pretending I...
That I could be like you.

She asked if I'm a lover.
I said I'd try to be.
She said love until your heart breaks,
Cause there are no guarantees.

Angel,
You're bulletproof,
You're so high,
You see the truth.
And I'm still on the ground pretending I...
That I could be like you

Ooh
Call out to heaven
Just to let them know
You're here.
Stay with me a moment.
Say I'm not alone
And tell me that I'll see you again.

Angel,
You're bulletproof,
You're so high,
You see the truth.
And I'm still on the ground pretending I...
And how could I have ever passed you by?
Cause I'm still on the ground pretending I...
That I could be like you.
That I could be like you.
