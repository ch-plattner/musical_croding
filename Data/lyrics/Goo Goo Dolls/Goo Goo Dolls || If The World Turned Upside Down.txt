
There's a moment you've been waiting all your live for
When you feel you've found a meaning you could die for
And it happens when you seem to least expect it
All at once you come alive and feel connected

I ignored the beat inside my heart for too long
And accepted what was right, but always felt wrong
It's a second-hand of time I've been a slave to
But inside there was a feeling, something I always knew

If the world turned upside down
If the sky changed places with the ground
All the whispers, all that's possible, be clear and loud
If the world turned upside down

When the road ahead just goes in one direction
And for every word you write there's contradiction
When the inner voice of reason's full of doubt
What's the point in fitting in, if you're designed to stand out

If the world turned upside down
if the sky changed places with the ground
All the whispers, all that's possible, be clear and loud
If the world turned upside down

I just wanna be free from limitations and rules
Imagine the space, where I could create
Imagine the look on their faces

If the world turned upside down
And the earth and sky changed around
If there'd be if we walk in the stars
We'd do everything we're told we can't
What we think and feel we could shout it out
If the world turned upside down

If the world turned upside down
