
Daylight burns your sleepy eyes
And it's hard to see you dreaming
You hide inside yourself
I wonder what you're thinkin'
And everything you're chasing
It seems to leave you empty

And I won't take long to burn
All eyes on me
Through the nothing that you've learned
All eyes on me
And the things you choose to be
All eyes on me

But your eyes look away
It's so hard to be someone
Strung out from today
And all that you knew slips away

You drown in deeper oceans
Inventing new religions
They smile and stab my back and
I lie and have to laugh

And I won't take long to burn
All eyes on me
Through the nothing that you've learned
All eyes on me
And the things you choose to be
All eyes on me

But your eyes look away
It's so hard to be someone
Strung out from today
And all that you knew slips away

And you hide in your room
And the lights turn away
And you move from the truth
It's all so far from you
