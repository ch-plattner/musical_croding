Walking over the same ole grass
Trying to stay off the beaten path
I don't need to apologize
For the things I don't recognize

Artie, take a look at me
And I wanna think about all the little things
That piss you off about me 

Hey there man
I'll take and scratch your cat
But I'll apologize for all the little things
That piss you off about me

Walking over the same ole ground
Thinking 'bout all the things we found
I don't wanna let it bring me down
I'm wantin' out of this dirty town

Artie, take a look at me
I might not wanna think of all the little things
That piss you off about me 

Walking over the same ole grass
Trying to stay on the beaten path
I don't need to apologize
For the things I don't recognize

Walking over the same ole ground
Thinking 'bout all the things we found
I don't wanna let it bring me down
I'm wantin' out of this dirty town

You - you... no, no,
Don't do, don't do, don't do anything, anything irrational
Here's the starting line
What happened?
