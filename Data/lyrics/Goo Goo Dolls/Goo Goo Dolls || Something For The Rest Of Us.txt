
I was a stranger, and you came to my side
and you said 'oh, you're alright now'
And you were so knowing,
I felt so lost and confused

Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true

I barely knew you, but you talked til' you laughed
til' you cried out so loud 'someone save me'
Oh, black streaks of Maybelline run down your cheeks again
I prayed for answers, you take the chances or refuse

Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true
Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true

Yeah, we belong
Yeah, we belong
Yeah, we belong
Yeah, we belong

Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true
Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true
Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true
Oh, I need you there
when the nightmares and dreams have come true
