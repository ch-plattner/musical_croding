And if the accident will, well we'll both fade away
And I'll leave you still, and we will both be safe

Say you're safe, your life will pass away
Only to be saved, by another's lonely stay

All the flowers I can grow and all the children's tears
And everything I know will vanish with the years 

Say you're safe, your life will pass away
Only to be saved by another's lonely stay

And if the accidents will, well we'll both fade away
But the trees will grow, until my dying day

All the flowers I can grow, and all the children's tears
And everything I know will vanish with the years

Say you're safe and your life will pass away
Only to be saved by another's lonely stay
