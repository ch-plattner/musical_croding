He burned down the house one night 
He had a loaded six-pack gun 
He said that Jesus Christ was just like a cop 
You know, you never know when they'll come 
She said every day above ground was another dream come true 
He said I'd hang and swap clich√©s all night 
But I'm not in love with you

And I never got serious 
'Til everything went black 
And I ain't so curious 
That I'm ever going back

On the lie 
On the lie 
On the lie 
On the lie

He said, man you want to be Elvis
I said I ain't dying face down 
He said you gotta die facing up in the world 
Cuz there's too many holes around 

He asked what was wrong with me 
He said I looked like a Hollywood girl 
I said that Hollywood can fall into the ocean, man 
Cuz it's the ugliest place in the whole wide world, and

And I never got serious 
'Til everything went black 
And I ain't so curious 
That I'm ever going back

On the lie 
On the lie 
On the lie 
On the lie

On the lie, he was 
On the lie 
On the lie, she was 
On the lie 
On the lie, he was 
On the lie 
It's all been a stinkin' lie
