
One, two, three, four!
Look around this dirty town
Drink it up till we fall down
Don't want to live forever this way
But it's gonna have to do for today

Oh, I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be

Before that hurried call
I had my back against the wall
No, don't want to be shown
Go out and learn your own

Oh, I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be

One, two, three, four!

Before that hurried call
I had my back against the wall
No, don't want to be shown
Go out and learn your own

Oh, I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be

I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
I'm addicted as I want to be
