
It's been a long, dark, lonely hall
Between the cracks, I can read the scrawl
It's written down in a crooked rhyme
You sold me out before my time, you know

But since then I been back down to the end
I can't believe the things you never said
I can't explain the words I never found
My whole world should come crashing down, you know

But you can't sell me out with everything you think about

I think back now I draw a blank, you know but
There ain't no need to dig the past, you know but
I don't wanna live my life in a day
I ain't got no need for this plastic cage

Cuz you don't think about anything I think about

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

But now you know for sure you're alive
Because you, you watched me leave before your eyes, you know I
I'm afraid to say your name, but I
I ain't afraid to share this blame because

You can't sell me out with everything you think about

You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

It's been a long, dark, lonely hall
Between the cracks, I can read the scrawl
Find a place that feels like home, you know
And get some clue to where I'm going, you know but

You don't think about anything I think about

You know what I mean 
You know what I mean 
You know what I mean 
You know what I mean

You know what I mean, oh no 
You know what I mean, oh 
You know what I mean, oh no 
You know what I mean
