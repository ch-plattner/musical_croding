
You're such a mystery to me
I can never figure you out
I'm always waiting just to see
What you're gonna do
How you're gonna be right now to me

I'm hangin by a thread feeling half-alive
I gotta get to you
Can you save my life tonight?
Ooh, tonight.

No I won't give up, no I won't back down
Never ever gonna let you go
Yeah you pull me in now I feel so free
I wanna do to you what you do to me
Yeah you lift me up, I never been so high
Now you're making me feel that I'm alive
No matter what I do, I always want more of you

Am I ever gonna get you next to me?
Come on will you give me a sign?
I think we both could use some mending
No matter what you say I'm gonna make you mine

Are you gonna keep me waiting?
Will you let me inside?
When you're coming undone
Do you wanna run away tonight?
Ooh, tonight

No I won't give up, no I won't back down
Never ever gonna let you go
Yeah you pull me in now I feel so free
I wanna do to you what you do to me
Yeah you lift me up, I never been so high
Now you're making me feel that I'm alive
No matter what I do, I always want more of you

I can't sleep here alone
Would you lay down beside me?
And come find me?
If the world ends tonight
And the stars lose their light
I will guide you home
I will guide you, yeah

No I won't give up, no I won't back down
Never ever gonna let you go
Yeah you pull me in now I feel so free
I wanna do to you what you do to me
Yeah you lift me up, I never been so high
Now you're making me feel that I'm alive
No matter what I do, I always want more of you
Oh yeah, I want more of you
I always want more of you
Oh yeah, I want more of you
I always want more of you!
