
I remember the night
I was singing to you
By the light of the TV
Had a bed on the floor
I couldn't give you much more
When you said, "This is all that I need."

All the darkest nights
All the broken dreams
Fade away when I'm with you
We fill the empty space
Burn the memories
Kiss it goodbye, forever tonight

When the world breaks your heart
I can put it back together
Write your name across the sky
So I'm always with you
Now it's you and me
Like the stars we burn forever
So listen when I say to you
I'll be there, you're not alone

I held your face in my hands
So I could feel you smile
Every time that I kiss you
You put your lips to my scars
Made a tattoo of stars
I felt the rush of blood and I knew

I never answer to
Anybody who
Tryna tear us down again
So take the angry words
Things that make you hurt
Kiss them goodbye, forever tonight

When the world breaks your heart
I can put it back together
Write your name across the sky
So I'm always with you
Now it's you and me
Like the stars we burn forever
So listen when I say to you
I'll be there, you're not alone
You're not alone

When the sun fades into shadows
When you call and no one's there
And the light goes out inside you
Don't you know that I'll be there

When the world breaks your heart
I can put it back together
Write your name across the sky
So I'm always with you
You're the only truth that I ever knew
Like the stars we burn forever
So listen when I say to you
I'll be there, you're not alone

When the sun turns into shadows
When you call and no one's there
And the lights go out inside you
I'll be there, you're not alone
You're not alone
