
Called you up ten years too late
Just to hear your voice again
I know your voice is still the same
I know that something's changed

My words are choked and full of tears
But still you listen to me dear
And someone's calling you away
And now I understand

The time that I've wasted
So bitter and faithless
Was wearing me down now, down now

So can you hear me, or would you sing along?
Or turn me down? Forget I ever wrote this for you.
So can you hear me, or has it been too long?
Admit I was wrong, and this is still your song.

Turn it on and off again
And now I lost another friend
I waded through my darkest thoughts
When I was sure to drown

And now I pass you on my way
And if you stop, what could I say?
Apologizes for yesterday
Like a fool I walk away

The time that I've wasted
So bitter and faithless
Was wearing me down now, down now

So can you hear me, or would you sing along?
Or turn me down? Forget I ever wrote this for you.
So can you hear me, or has it been too long?
Admit I was wrong, and this is still your song.

And all I understand
We're here and gone again
Even through a thousand sleepless nights

I fill the page with my beliefs
It's all I have to keep
Tear it up and start again

So can you hear me, or would you sing along?
Or turn me down? Forget I ever wrote this for you.
So can you hear me, or has it been too long?
Admit I was wrong, and this is still your song.

I don't pretend to understand all the things I put you through
And I don't need forgiveness, but I owe one thing to you
This is your song
This is your song
