
God, you still amaze me
When you speak to me that way
Oh, the sound of your voice
The look in your eyes, you stand there in your grace

You told me that the scars you bear
Are beautiful and real
So turn the lights back on again
All to see the things you feel

And we've got one night
To let the whole world know
Just how perfect we could be
Just close your eyes and then you'll see

We've got one night
To let the whole world know
Forget about the falling stars
Tonight we'll show them who we are, we are

Feel it when you're near me
And I know when you're not there
Numb on the edge and so alone
And no one seems to care

But you reach out and pull me back
And love me 'til I'm free
All the joy in my life I feel like
I've lost you, see inside of me

And we've got one night
To let the whole world know
Just how perfect we could be
Just close your eyes and then you'll see

We've got one night
To let the whole world know
Forget about the falling stars
Tonight we'll show them who we are, we are

Life's a song I'll sing
And it doesn't matter anymore if anyone is listening to me
'Cause you move like light
You send all to me, tend to pull me through my life

And we've got one night
To let the whole world know
Just how perfect we could be
Just close your eyes and then you'll see

We've got one night
To let the whole world know
Forget about the falling stars
Tonight we'll show them who we are, we are
