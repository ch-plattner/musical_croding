
Crowded rooms full of empty faces 
Our deepest conversation full of lies 
Another night with all my friends 
The kind you'll never see again 
I wonder if they'll see through my disguise 

And I want to say 
That I can't hold back 
And it might be wrong 
But it's all I have 

Come take me home tonight 
Come take me home 
Oh I need you now 
I'm lost without you 
A million miles but I will find you 
So take me home 

It's 3 A.M. and I can't sleep without you 
I think I've found the perfect words to say 
The shattered light transmits my voice 
Sometimes we don't have a choice 
I'd wake you up from half a world away 

And I tried so hard 
Tried to be so strong 
But you see the crash 
My defense is gone 

Come take me home tonight 
Come take me home 
Oh I need you now 
I'm lost without you 
A million miles but I will find you 

Come take me home tonight 
Come take me home 
Oh, come take me home tonight 
Come take me home 

Come take me home 
The shattered light transmits my voice 
Sometimes we don't have a choice 
Come take me home 
Wake you up from half a world away 
Oh I need you now 
I'm lost without you 
I'm holding on till I can find you 
So take me home
