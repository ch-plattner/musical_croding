
Don't take much lookin' back to know I took my coffee black then 
Nothing's different now, but nothin' seems the same and it's alright
Your optimistic views, your hundred dollar running shoes and 
Carpel tunnel syndrome, we all had a laugh about it

I'd love to stick around but I gotta tell you all
So long 
Oh so long
Oh so long 
But I didn't wanna tell you all so long

Don't take much lookin' back to know I faked that heart attack then 
Nothing's different now, but nothin' seems the same and it's alright 
You always spoke the truth from circa disco Abba boots and 
All that showbiz talk, oh we all had a laugh about it

I'd love to stick around but I gotta tell you all
So long 
Oh so long
Oh so long 
But I didn't wanna tell you all so long

Oh so long
Oh so long 
But I didn't wanna tell you all so long

I gotta get back to where I belong
Long 
Oh so long
Oh so long 
But I didn't wanna tell you all so long

So long 
Oh so long
Oh so long 
But I didn't wanna tell you all so long
