
It was only last June when her old man ran away 
She couldn't stop cryin', she knew he was gone to stay 
Ten thirty five on a lonely Friday night 
She was standin' by the fire, uh, she was lookin' alright

I asked her if she wanted to dance and she said 
All she wanted was a good man who wanted to know if I thought I was qualified
I said, baby, don't waste your time 
I know what's on your mind 
I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I can never take the place of your man

It hurt me so bad when I saw the tears in her eyes 
She was all he ever wanted and now she wanted to die 
He left her with a baby and another one on the way 
She couldn't stop cryin' she knew he was gone to stay

She asked me if we couldn't be friends and I said 
Oh, honey baby, that's okay you know and I know, know, know you wouldn't be satisfied 

I said, baby, don't waste your time 
And I know what's on your mind 
I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I could never take the place of your man

I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I could never take the place of your man 

I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I could never take the place of your man 

La la la oh oh woah 
Never take the place of your man 
That's all I need, girl 
Is a one night, one night, one night stand 
I don't wanna be like a steak in your mind 
Oh, girl, if you need a friend I'm there by your side 
Sha la la la, sha la la 
Sha la la la, sha la la
