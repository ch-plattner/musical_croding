
There are days when I feel that everything that's good is gone
There are times that I feel no matter what I do, it's wrong
I've walked these streets alone just living day to day
Clocking in, fading out, don't tell me what I'm feeling now
You shook my dreams away

Tired of waiting around
Now, what are we becoming
Keep the car running

The only answer I know
Never taking it slow
Just it keep it coming
Keep the car running

I'm not leaving without you, you're the one I can't lose
Say goodbye to all the things in life that tried to pull us down
Yeah, we'll make something out of nothing
Yeah, yeah, keep the car running

And I can hear the sound of that dream
Where the engines fill the boulevard
Innocence is never lost
When you feel it pounding in your heart

Don't tell me it's over now
This ain't the time to rest
Bruised and battered, torn and tattered
Look at me, it doesn't matter
Still got some fight left

Tired of waiting around
Now, what are we becoming
Keep the car running

The only answer I know
Never taking it slow
Just it keep it coming
Keep the car running

I'm not leaving without you, you're the one I can't lose
Say goodbye to all the things in life that tried to pull us down
Yeah, we'll make something out of nothing
Yeah, yeah keep the car running

We are, we are, we are the start of something new
Close your eyes and come with me and just hold onto
We are, we are, we are the only thing that's true
Just believe it's you and me and know that we can't lose

Tired of waiting around
Now, what are we becoming
Keep the car running

The only answer I know
Never taking it slow
Just it keep it coming
Keep the car running

I'm not leaving without you, you're the one I can't lose
Say goodbye to all the things in life that tried to pull us down
Yeah, we'll make something out of nothing
Yeah, yeah, keep the car running

We are, we are, we are the start of something new
Yeah, keep the car running
We are, we are, we are the only thing that's true
Just believe it's you and me and know that we can't lose
We are, we are, we are the only thing that's true
Yeah, just keep the car running
We are, we are, we are the only thing that's true
Yeah, keep the car running
