
Friday night, I just got back
Had my eyes shut, was dreamin' 'bout the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I shoulda got loaded, some reason I stayed

I started drifting to a different place
I realized I was fallin' off the face of the world
And there was nothing there to bring you back

Cuz you're a million miles away
A million miles away
And there's nothing there to bring you back today
Today, oh no

I took a ride way downtown
The streets were empty, there was no one around
I went to places that we used to go
Seen all the faces that we used to know

I'm at the wrong end of the looking-glass
I tried to hold onto the hand of the past and then you
And there's nothing there to bring you back

Cuz you're a million miles away
A million miles away
And there's nothing there to bring you back today
Today, oh no

Cuz you're a million miles away
A million miles away
You're just a million miles away
A million miles away
And there's nothing there to bring you back today
Today-ay-ay, oh no!
