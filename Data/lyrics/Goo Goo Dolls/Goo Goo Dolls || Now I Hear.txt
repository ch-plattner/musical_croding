
Take time to try and find a light, that shines behind your eyes tonight,
I found a deep dark place inside,
There's more to both of you than, anyone's expecting here tonight,
Wish I could make that right, well,
They covered up your eyes,
They never gave you nothing more than pain.

Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
Throwing it all away,
Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
Throwing it all away.

Don't make a sound, we stayed away from all the static on the line,
I guess we never stopped to shine,
I'd cry aloud if I remember, all the mess I'd left behind,
But then I had to lie and,

They covered up your eyes,
They never gave you nothing more than pain.
I come around for you I know,
Cause I'm feeling the same way.

Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
Throwing it all away,
Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
Throwing it all away.

[Guitar interlude]

Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
You showed us all the way.
Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
You showed us all the way.

Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
You showed us all the way.
Now I hear,
Yeah I hear,
You showed us all the way.
