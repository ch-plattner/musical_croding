
Reach
For higher ground
About the way you look
The way you scream out loud

Mine
Just like the last time
It's all the same to me
She said

Let's pretend
My January friend
I'm wanting you again
I wanna touch ya
Every single heart that beats pretend
My January friend
I'm wanting you again
I wanna touch ya
Every single heart that beats

Cry
Don't cry out loud
You've gotta bear your cross but never dream too loud
And you're tied
Tied to the next time
You realize
Your crimes

Let's pretend
My January friend
I'm wanting you again
I wanna touch ya
Every single heart that beats pretend
My January friend
I'm wanting you again
I wanna touch ya
Every single heart that beats

Time stood still Monday morning, yeah
Showed me what I had to see
It's not the way I thought it to be, oh yeah

You're my January friend
You're my January friend
You're my January friend
And every heart that beats pretend
My January friend
You're my January friend
You're my January friend
You're my January friend
And every heart that beats tonight's pretend
