Truth is a whisper only a choice
Nobody hears above this noise
To the ??
There's always a risk when you try to believe
In this ??
I know that there's so much more than me
Yeah

Yeah, you're caught in the rules of the world
It's a just a promise no one ever keeps
Now it's changing while you sleep
There's no one here can see 

(You know all I am)
Feel the smoldering
(You know all I am)
Can you teach me to believe in something

Sometimes you choke on the smell just to breathe
I need to question what I need
Living in the silence that beats through the mind
Still you forget what you deny
Yeah

Now you're caught in the rules of the world
It's a just a promise no one ever keeps
And now it's changing in your sleep
There's no one here can see 

(You know all I am)
Feel the smoldering
(You know all I am)
Can you teach me to believe in something

There's a wall to answer to
Do you listen when it speaks
Orders everything for you

And do you find it hard to sleep
Or is it easy on your own
Will you ever find some peace
Before you're gone

(You know all I am)
Feel the smoldering
(You know all I am)
Can you teach me to believe in something
