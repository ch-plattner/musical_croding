
And the guy across the street

I hung your picture on the wall
But that's all it is
I break my fingers to make a call
But that's all it is
I know you're livin' way out west
But I don't think that I confessed
Everything I feel

You say you got no faith in things that you can't see
Well, I'm sorry I ain't there with you, but you ain't here with me
And I'm down in all my fears
I ain't cryin' no tears over you

Cuz everything's wrong
But it's alright
Everything's wrong
Well, it's alright

You said that this is crazy, you're half a world away
Well, I'm sittin' here and thinkin', but I didn't know what to say
So I said something I can't touch, I always want way too much anyways

Cuz everything's wrong
But it's alright
Everything's wrong
Well, it's alright

I hung your picture on the wall, but that's all it is
I break my fingers to make a call, but that's all it is
I know you're livin' way out west, don't get me wrong
I'm not impressed with you no more
