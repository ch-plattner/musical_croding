
I'll open up my head awhile 
Its been dead for years 
Must've been a victim of my peers 
One is for my happiness 
The other for my health 
The last is something bigger than myself

I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one to say

I'm talkin' to myself again 
I'll just start a fight 
And nobody can prove me wrong, I'm right 
Anti-hero idol with a suicide excuse 
A thousand other suckers who try and fill your shoes

I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one 
I ain't the only one to say

I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one 
I ain't the only one to say

Little pictures in my head, turnin' inside-out again 
Cuz fuckin' up takes practice, I feel I'm well rehearsed 
Because the past is a bully and the future's even worse 
Tell me what you fear cuz I can feel it like a curse

Well, you used to be a folk singer, now you're just a joke singer
Ain't no smokin' dope singer, swingin' from a rope singer

I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one 
I ain't the only one to say
