
Why are you so green
How can you say that to me?
When did you fall from grace?
You've got a dirty face
And it's killin' me

Why don't you listen?
Why don't you listen to me?
I'm drownin' but I never felt so free

Can you follow me?
Will you justify me please?
Said you're wrong
Said you're gone
I'll guess I'll wait another night
For what you're gonna say
Back to me

Why don't you listen?
Why don't you listen to me?
I'm drownin' but I never felt so free

And I try
But I never try too long
When you're gone

Why don't you listen?
Why don't you listen to me?
I'm drownin' but I never felt so free

Why don't you listen / hear what you're missin'
