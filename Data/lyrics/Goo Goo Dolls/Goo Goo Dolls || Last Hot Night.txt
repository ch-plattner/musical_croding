Yeah I was sitting in my room all alone 'cause the innocence is gone
And I smashed the only radio because it never played any songs
I was tired of working hard for other people's dreams to come true
So I smoked my last cigarette and headed out into the night
Yeah the last hot
The last hot night, the last hot night in America
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in the world
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in America
And I'm looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you

Yeah, the future's full of lovers and intentions, anger and lust
And I dialed the only number, the only number I knew I could trust
And if it's coming to an end, you know I'm gonna feel alive one last time
And if I don't hear from you, you know I'm gonna keep looking all night
Yeah the last hot
The last hot night, the last hot night in America
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in the world
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in America
And I'm looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you

You're the only thing, the only thing good inside my soul
And I'm gonna take a chance on the edge 'cause I'm losing control
Of everything I know

The silence broke when I saw your face again
Crash of life came rushing through my veins
Yeahhhhhh
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in America
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in the world
It's the last hot night, the last hot night in America
And I'm looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you
Looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you
It's the last hot night in America
