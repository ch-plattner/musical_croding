Oh, you're frail now
I couldn't laugh about it
Tragedy sets you free, but
I should have known it from the start

I should have known that it was
Just another sequel
Just another reason for you

How's your day
Did it go your way but
You never ask about it
All the things I wish I'd be
I should have known it from the start

I should have known that it was
Just another sequel
Just another reason for you
Just another sequel
Just another reason for your sighs

Extra pale
Oh, you're frail now
I couldn't laugh about it
Tragedy sets you free, but
I should have known that it was

Just another sequel
Just another reason for you
Just another sequel
Just another reason for you
