I'm a fortunate son of a fortunate son
Livin' large on the wrong side of town
Too many friends and the fun never ends
Drinkin' and hangin' around

I wanna rule the world, wanna swallow it whole
At least I could kick it all down 
I wanna kick it all down

Eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be

I don't take the bus and I never walk too far 
The furthest I got was my own backyard
A fist full of cash that somebody else earned 
Send me some more when it all got burned

I wanna take control, wanna make it all mine
At least I could kick it all down 
I wanna' kick it all down

Eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be

Never ever ever
Never ever ever
Never ever ever
Never ever ever

I get what I want if I make up my mind
I'm turnin' you inside out
I wanna rule the world, wanna swallow it whole
I think I'll just kick it all down
I wanna kick it all down

Eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see 
Eyes wide open, what you mean 
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
Eyes wide open
[fade out]
