And they're holding up for cheaper Chinese food 
If I'm old then I would have a tainted attitude 
Why'd those neon lights all lose their common blue?

And it's not like me to feel so important 
And it's not like me to go and wreck your day 
And I never thought I'd see it so exploited 
Ah, but I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 
Oh yes, I know that somethin' bad has gotta change

Well I see her walking round the block till six a.m. 
The thermometer's at minus five degrees 
And I'm wondering where all that hard earned money goes 
To her head or towards a shred of dignity 

And it's not like me to feel so important 
And it's not like me to go and wreck your day 
And I never thought I'd see it so exploited 
Ah, but I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 
Oh yes, I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 

And it's not like me to feel so important 
And it's not like me to go and wreck your day 
And I never thought I'd see it so exploited 
Ah, but I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 
Oh yes, I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 
Yes, I know that somethin' bad has gotta change 
Oh yes, I know that somethin' bad has gotta change
