
Beat me, Jenny,
Beat me slowly, now
Beat me, Jenny, 
Don't you know, I said
Beat me, Jenny, 
Beat me slowly, now
Beat me, Jenny, 
Don't you know
I didn't love you
All of the time
But now you left me
And it's a crime

Shanamama, I ain't beaten now
Shanamama, don't you know, I said
Shanamama, I ain't beaten now
Shanamama, don't you know

Beat me, Jenny,
Beat me slowly, now
Beat me, Jenny, 
Don't you know, I said
Beat me, Jenny, 
Beat me slowly, now
Beat me, Jenny, don't you know

I could've loved you
I didn't try
You made me happy
Oh, I've gotta fly.
