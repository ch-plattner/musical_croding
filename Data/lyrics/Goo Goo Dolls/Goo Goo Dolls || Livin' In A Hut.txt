I've got an ugly liver from drinking too much
I've got painful sliver from thinking too much
Oh, I don't want to go on livin' in this rut
Oh, I think I'll go out and build me a hut but
Curiosity has got me
Tied up right back where it wants me
And all the things that you will do
Make me think I haven't got a clue

I've good a real good sense for seeking out the booze
But I can't afford to buy a pair of shoes
And when I get some cash it's already been spent
Oh, I can smoke and drink but I can't pay my rent

I've got an ugly liver from drinking too much
I've got painful sliver from thinking too much
Oh, I don't want to go on livin' in this rut
Oh, I think I'll go out and build me a hut but

Curiosity has got me
Tied up right back where it wants me
And all the things that you will do
Make me think I haven't got a clue
