
When you kissed me
Yeah, I felt so alive
And every little secret you told me
I keep down inside

And in that heated moment, yeah, we swore we'd never change
But all those pretty pictures they just start to fade away
And everything that I believed is getting hard to find
Have I lost the only one who ever felt like mine?

Now I'm caught in this storm we call love
So alone
Come find me
Out on my own
Take me home
Don't you know I'm lonely

I'll give you everything that you ask of me
And I'll give you all I have if it makes you believe
'Cause I'm caught in this storm we call love

I was taught to always turn the other cheek
And you know I took the beating and I stayed up on my feet
And this faith is getting heavy, but you know it carries me
From the streets to the river where the broken dreams flow out into the sea

I keep on looking but something's always missing
I keep on looking for something bigger than me
From the saints, to the sinners, all the losers and the winners
Yeah, we're all just looking for something, something to believe in

'Cause I'm caught in this storm we call love
So alone
Come find me
Out on my own
Take me home
Don't you know I'm lonely

I'll give you everything that you ask of me
And I'll give you all I have if it makes you believe
'Cause I'm caught in this storm we call love
We call love (we call love)

I'm tired of sleeping
Sleeping through my own life
It's time to wake up
Wake up with eyes open wide
I'm tired of sleeping
Sleeping through my own life
It's time to wake up with arms open wide

Now I'm caught in this storm we call love
So alone
Come find me
Out on my own
Take me home
Don't you know I'm lonely

I'll give you everything that you ask of me
And I'll give you all I have if it makes you believe
'Cause I'm caught in this storm we call love

I'm tired of sleeping
Sleeping through my own life
It's time to wake up
Wake up with eyes open wide
I'm tired of sleeping
Sleeping through my own life
It's time to wake up with arms open wide
Open wide
Open wide
