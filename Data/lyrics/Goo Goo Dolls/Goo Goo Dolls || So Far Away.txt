
Why do you stare me down?
Am I wrong? 
Should I turn and kiss the ground? 
And I never felt that way 
I ain't the one and you know I don't come from such a place

And I didn't get those things 
Those things that you can't grow 
You say that it's all my fault 
And I don't need to know

Tell me something I don't know 
And I'll find that I'm always looking 'round behind me 
You said that it's all been said before 
Now I find that there's something I don't know

And I hate your attitude 
I ain't scared at all cuz it don't matter what you do 
And I'll turn around to see the truth 
You're tearing it down, yeah, you're bringing it down 
And it's all on you

And I didn't get those things
Those things that you can't grow 
You say that it's all my fault 
And I don't need to know

Tell me something I don't know 
And I'll find that I'm always looking 'round behind me 
You said that it's all been said before 
Now I find that there's something I don't know

And I know 
I don't know 
(Rock and roll) 
And I'll stay there
If you break enough glass and there's no one to hear 
And your heart's full of hate cuz your mind's full of fear 
Let it go

Oh, so far away 
So far away 
So far away 
(Something I don't know)
Oh, so far away 
So far away 
So far away
