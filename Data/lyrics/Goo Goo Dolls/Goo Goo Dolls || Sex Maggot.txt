
Well I was hangin' around the railway station 
My mind was insane from total degradation
Little boy blue was a tootin' his horn now
Scared those cows right out of the door now

I hear you screaming but you can't come in
Cuz I know that you're just a sex maggot!

Mommy and daddy used to play this game now
Told me boys and girls are really all the same now
I don't know the difference at the age of 21
Who's telling me, I don't like anyone, hah!

I hear you screaming but you can't come in, no, no,
Cuz I know, that you're just a sex maggot!

I hear you screaming but you can't be found
Cause I know, that you're a, you're a sex maggot!
