
You never know
Some folks think the world just moves too slow
But was it you
Told me I'm your everything you

[Chorus]
Hit me like I never felt before
(Hit me like I never felt before)
Hit me like a sucker punch
Running to the car and now you're
Hit me like I never felt before
Stealing for the last time

You never take
A promise from a man who sheds his skin
Had to wait
Formed my aching heart to break it

[Chorus]

Now everyone gets angry
And I feel it when you're holding me
In the right place
At the right time
To the right degree
It's greater than for the great I found
For dealing with your own ??scene??
You know that it ain't easy
(That ain't easy)
(That ain't easy)
(that ain't easy)

Hit me like I never felt before
(Hit me like I never felt before)
Hit me like I never felt before
(Hit me like I never felt before)
I'm stealing for the last time
