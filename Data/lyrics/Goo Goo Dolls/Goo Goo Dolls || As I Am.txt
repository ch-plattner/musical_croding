Yeah, I tried so hard to make it
Then I watched it slip away
The hardest thing we face
Is the silence of the space
At times I feel so empty through the day

You know you get me through the darkness
And you get me through the day

Calling out for you again, you always guide my way
Calling out for you, you know you heal these empty days
And it's all because you take me as I am
And it's all because you take me as I am

You know I run to find the answers
What I need to find is you
And I don't need anything
No, I don't need anything
Because I know you always take me as I am

You know you get me through the darkness
You know you get me through the day

Calling out for you again, you always find my way
Calling out for you, you know you heal these empty days
And it's all because you take me as I am
And it's all because you take me as I am

Calling out for you again, you always guide my way
Calling out for you, you know you heal these empty days
And it's all because you take me as I am
And it's all because you take me as I am
And it's all because you take me as I am
