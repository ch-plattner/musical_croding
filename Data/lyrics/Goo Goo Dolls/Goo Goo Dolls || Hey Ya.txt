If I could give you
All the things you've been denied
Would it change you
Would you feel alive
But all that's left now
Are these words that I've been trying to say to you
And together we'll get by somehow

All you ever wanted was someone to find
The truth you hide from everyone deep inside

Hey ya, hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya, hey ya

And I would drown to save you
From the sinking thoughts you feel
And I'll love you just the same
So don't you ever feel ashamed
Cause we all get tired of fighting
Just to feel like we belong
And I know you feel forgotten
But I've been here all along to say

All you ever wanted was someone to find
The truth you hide from everyone deep inside

Hey ya, hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya, hey ya

Hey ya, hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya, hey ya

And you hide yourself so deep inside
Will I ever see
Ever see you
Now I'm the one who's been denied
But I believe in you
Believe in you

Hey ya, hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya, hey ya

Hey ya, hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya, hey ya

Hey ya, hey ya

You're the only one I want
