I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil, in all direction
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

I'm found in love I had lost
It had been gone for too long
Hear no evil, in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil, in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

Don't change
Don't change, yeah, yeah
