
Well, I saw you once
Then I blew it for the next ten thousand days
I should have flapped away
I needed to come back and show you
I needed to go back
I know it's wrong 
I laughed to get along

[Chorus]
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away another day
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away
Mama just called
Says she's extra sad today

Well, I spent the whole day yesterday
On clich¨¦s about love
Making me remember when your pushes became shoves
I wanted to come back and show you
Needed to go back
I know it's wrong
I laughed to get along

[Chorus]

So why'd you go and play my trust
Today's the same as yesterday, and I'm okay
??I take the time this weatherman did time again to get along??
Since you've been gone
I'll get along anyway at all

Mama just called
Says she's tucked away
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away another day
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away
Mama just called
Says she's tucked away another day
(Tucked away)
(Tucked away)
(Tucked away)
(Tucked away)
