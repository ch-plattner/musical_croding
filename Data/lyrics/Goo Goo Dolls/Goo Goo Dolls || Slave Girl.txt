
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I drag her around wherever I go 
This little woman drives me insane
She's tied to my ankle with a ball and chain

For sixteen years, she's been hangin' around
Tryin' to bury me in a hole in the ground
Well, I think it's time that I even the score
There's only room for one in this cage of yours

Don't save me when I startin' to drown
Don't use me when you don't want me around
Just be my slave girl, cuz that's all I need 
So take a little step back to the stone age with me
Go!

Well I hear a strange noise as I lie in my bed 
I feel a lotta water drippin' on my head
I look around tried to see through my hair
You left me alone, but do you think I care?

Cuz you moved me when I was takin' my time
You abused me when I'm outta line 
You tried to warn me of the danger sign
So watch out!
Go!

Well, you got me in the bondage of another age
You drive me to distraction in a primitive way 
I can't control my instincts when I hear her say 
Just come around and see me if you lose your way

So join my chain gang, play along with me
I'll be your caveman, it's basic as can be
I'm not insane, man, I'm just outta my tree
