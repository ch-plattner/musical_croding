You're likin' what I say
Guess I was afraid you'd run away now
I'm loyal like a stray
Never gonna turn and run away now
A passion junkie's fix is never satisfied
You're never gonna break his heart so have some fun abuse it

Strange Love
You're a Strange One

You washed away your yesterday
I saw you cleanin' up
A bucket full of doubts
And a little bit of power grabbin'
When it's all done
What are you gonna do
With you

A passion junkie's dog ain't got a collar on
He's never gonna break so go ahead and shake him

Strange Love
Breaks Us Down
Strange Love
Though nothing's gonna break us now

And you're actin' suprised
Oh, all of the time
Into your charms
Slips my life

Strange Love
Breaks Us Down
Strange Love
Though nothing's gonna break us now
