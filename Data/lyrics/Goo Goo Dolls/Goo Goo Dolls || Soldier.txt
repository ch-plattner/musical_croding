
When you came back I knew you'd have a story
You need someone to ease the pain of living life
You're like a soldier in the fray, seeking shelter
from all the madness that you've seen raining down now

I know things change, your world has slipped away
I know things change, but you're living like a soldier who's caught in the fray
Don't lose your faith, it's not so cold, it's not too late

When you were naive you were so invincible
and you laughed at anyone and anything that ever got in your way
But now the mirror shows the change and you don't see that
you're sinking back into the crowd, an echo fading

I know things change, your world has slipped away
I know things change, but you're living like a soldier who's caught in the fray
Don't lose your faith, it's not so cold, it's not too late

And I never thought I'd see
you living on your knees
A slave to some disease
that holds you captive

And you can look inside of me
but the answers that you seek
and everything you need
is all inside you

I know things change, your world has slipped away
I know things change, but you're living like a soldier who's caught in the fray
Don't lose your faith, it's not so cold, it's not too late
