
What do you need from me tonight?
I feel you look right through me now
I can't pretend it's all right
Maybe we'll find a way somehow
Why do we need to turn it on?
Why does it always feel so wrong?

[Chorus]
What do you need from me tonight?
The truth is so complicated now
You feel so free to say
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong

Fear makes you fragile darlin'
Hate is so heavy when you're weak
Now we're both lost in anger
When we're alone we'll find some peace
Why do we need to turn it on?
Why does it always seem so wrong?

What do you need from me tonight?
The truth is so complicated now
You feel so free to say
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong

Why do we need to turn it on?
Why does it always seem so wrong?

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong

Why do we need to turn it on?
Why does it always seem so wrong?
