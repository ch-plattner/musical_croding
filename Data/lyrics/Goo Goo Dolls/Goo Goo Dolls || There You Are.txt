Give me a reason now that I can understand
Pick up the pieces now and put 'em in my hand
I've been up and down for you, my sufferin' extreme
I fell on my face for you, now I know what it means

And I self destruct
I close my eyes and there
There you are
There you are
You are
There you are

Yeah, you can run out west, forget you know my name
You say you got your shit together, but you ain't got no faith
Method in madness now, there's madness in my soul
I run from the darkness, now I ain't got no place to go

And I self destruct
I close my eyes and there
There you are
There you are
You are
There you are

There you are 
There you are 
You are 
There you are

There you are 
There you are
