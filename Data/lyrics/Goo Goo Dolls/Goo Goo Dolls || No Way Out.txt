1... 2... 1, 2, 3, 4!

I've been around...And I realize it's always the same
All the time...And I realize it's all been unchanged
What I find...And you realize there's no one home
There's no way out...When you realize you're all alone 

Some say, there's no way out
Here today, there's no way out

Every time I'm walking down by Delaware Park
You rarely hold my hand when it's after dark
And all of the places that we go and the things that we have seen

There's no way out
There's no way out 

Some say...And you realized that time goes by
And I'm still in the way...And you realized you're still alive
Alive today...And you realize you're not gonna die
Ever the same...And you realize the sun goes by 

Some say, there's no way out
Here today, there's no way out 

Every time I come a-knockin' at your door
You tell me to turn away, pal you're too poor
I ain't a rich boy, I've heard about all that
All the places that I go it's ching ching ching

There's no way out
There's no way out

And I realize it's always the same
And I realize it's all been unchanged
And you realize there's no one home
When you realize you're all alone
(screaming throughout the above phrase) 
Every time I'm waiting for you in the rain
My mom says our love is sunk in a God damn vein 
I stand around and I think it's gonna work
But you look at me like I'm a jerk, oh!

There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
