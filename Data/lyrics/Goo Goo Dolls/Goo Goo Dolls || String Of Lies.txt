I've got no politics, no influential friend or two
I've got ideas, but it's nothin' I picked up at school
I might be running, but I'm never running back to you

And here's a letter from the real world, I don't expect you'll reply
And anything you're gonna tell me, it's just another lie

I had to wait so long that weeks and months that passed me by 
You've got no power and my situation don't apply 
You ask me how I am, I lie and say I'm doing fine

And with your sugar-sweetend alibis, there was a truth I never knew 
And all the attitude you gave me, it's coming back to you

String of lies, it's always compromise with you 
String of lies, you know there's nothing left to do 
String of lies, it's been a string of lies with you

And here's a letter from the real world, I don't expect you'll reply 
And anything you're gonna tell me, it's just another lie

String of lies, we always compromise for you 
String of lies, you know there's nothing left to do 
String of lies, it's been a string of lies with you 
String of lies, we always compromise for you 

And here's a letter from the real world
