
Oh I want you now
So please don't let me down
Oh just shut your mouth
And know that you are everything to me
Can we just let go
Of what we can't control
And if the world should spin too fast
I'll slow it down for you

I still remember you
The dizzy dance with me and you
We lived our lives without a clue
And never tried to find the meaning
Those days weren't meant to last
I can't ache for what is past
'Cause I know what it means to be
So close that I could see inside of you

Oh my friend, nothing ever ends
Just look around 'cause this is right where you and I belong

Oh, I want you now
So please don't let me down
Oh just shut your mouth
And know that you are everything to me
Can we just let go
Of what we can't control
And if the world should spin too fast
I'll slow it down for you

You know I loved a girl
Who said that I could change the world
If only I was brave enough
To live the life in front of me
These memories are fading fast
They're scattered like a broken glass
Will they be mended
Or as easily just swept away

Oh my friend this is not the end
Just look around 'cause this is right where you and I belong

Oh I want you now
So please don't let me down
Oh just shut your mouth
And know that you are everything to me
Can we just let go
Of what we can't control
And if the world should spin too fast
I'll slow it down for you

Falling from this height
Just might break your light
Take a chance for me
The only way you see
Twist your hand into mine
Don't you leave this behind
If we're losing time
I'll slow it down for you

Oh, I want you now
So please don't let me down
Oh just shut your mouth
And know that you are everything to me
Can we just let go
Of what we can't control
And if the world should spin too fast
I'll slow it down for you

I'll slow it down for you
I'll slow it down for you
Oh, I want you now
So please don't let me down
And if the world should spin too fast
I'll slow it down for you

Summer love and winter rain
You know they always fade away
But in the end you know
You and I will still remain
