
And I feel
All the faint morning light
Filled with hope
Cause you're here in my life
And we've gone
From the edge of our souls
Made it back to a place we call home
You... See me through
I was alone in the dark and the fear was my truth

Yeah all the things that you are
Beautifully broken,
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight
We'll light up the stars

All that you are

I feel wrong
I'm so human and flawed
I'll break down even though I'm still strong
And time... will make fools of us all
Build us up and then laughs when we fall
You... pull me through
When I'm alone in the dark and the fear is my truth

Yeah all the things that you are
Beautifully broken,
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight
We'll light up the stars

All that you are

Your the sound of redemption
The faith that I've lost the answers
I'm seeking no matter the cost
You opened the window now I can see
And you taught me forgiveness
By giving your love back to me

Yeah all the things that you are
Beautifully broken,
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight

Yeah all the things that you are
Beautifully broken,
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight

Let your heart sing and tonight
We'll light up the stars
All that you are

Oh, I feel... all the faint morning light
Filled with hope cause you're here in my life.
