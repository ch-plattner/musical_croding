
Do you know where you wanna go?
I ain't got time for you now 
Do you think, that I'll ever be?

Cuz all I ever wanted's so far gone
And if I had my chance, I'd go along

You're makin' me fall down
I'm fallin' down again 
I wish you could fall down
Can you catch me darling?

Do you see what you do to me? 
You ain't got time for it now 
Do you think, that I'll ever be?

Cuz all I ever wanted's so far gone 
And if I had my chance, I'd go along

You're makin' me fall down 
I'm falling down again 
I wish you could fall down 
Can you catch me darling?

Cuz all I ever wanted's so far gone 
And if I had my chance, I'd go along

You're makin' me fall down 
I'm falling down again 
I wish you could fall down 
Can you catch me darling, oh no
I'm home,
I'm home,
I'm home, 
I'm home
