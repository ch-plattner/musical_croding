Well I went down to your house just the other day,
Only to discover you had gone astray.
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart

Well I called you on the telly just the other day
Only to discover you had gone astray

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
