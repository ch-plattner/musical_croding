I don't know what you want
You and your silly stomp
You shake your back for me
Then wish that you were dead
And every single time
You blow your silly mind
With more laughing glue
I don't know who you are
I don't see any proof
You got a filthy trick
Then get a filthy dick
And every time you wait
You have to masturbate
Oh, you know it well
Wait, don't stop!

And now I'm done with this
And it's so viscious
You criticize my view
Then criticize my 'tude
But there's just one thing
That I'm interested in,
Oh, what's into you!
