
One to many times I've seen you in a frown
You hold your head down in despair
Oh, but, the time is now you wear that frown
Cause you'll never see me again

Fortune, misfortune
Oh, such a distortion
Fortune, misfortune
Oh, such a distortion

You keep on reaching for those things you just can't keep
You keep on searching for some more
Oh, but I know, in this what you stole, you are so greedy 
You bet your stealin' like before

Fortune, misfortune
Fortune, misfortune
Oh, such a distortion
Fortune, misfortune
Oh, such a distortion
