
Yeah I'm fadin' and I call out 
No one hears me 
Never been, never felt, never thought I'd say a word

Weighed down 
Safe now 

You're naked inside your fear 
You can't take back all those years
And shots in the dark from empty guns
Are never heard by anyone 
Never heard by anyone

Yeah I'm hiding in the fallout 
Now I'm wasted 
They don't need me, don't want me, don't hear a word I say

Weighed down 
Safe now 

You're naked inside your fear
You can't take back all those years 
And shots in the dark from empty guns 
Are never heard by anyone 
Never heard by anyone

Inside your head 
No one's there 
And I don't think I'll ever be 
And I don't care

You're naked inside your fear
You can't take back all those years 
And shots in the dark from empty guns 
Are never heard by anyone 
Never heard by anyone 
By anyone 
By anyone
