You take a lot of chances with your feelings
No one really knows what you feel
Fixing is the only way you're dealin'
You turn your pretty head and think it's real

[Chorus]
Oh, you
(You)
You take it so slowly
And your eyes look so lonely
But it's only when you think about me
Oh, yeah
When you think about me
Think about me

And I got ahead
Don't let me speak
And you got a secret I can't keep
You see a little stranger in your mirror
The guy you never knew is what you fear 

[Chorus]

And all you want is something I can't be
All you want from me is what you need
And now I'm saying I don't know

You take it so slowly
And your eyes look so lonely
But it's only
(But it's only)

Oh, you
(Oh, you)
You take it so slowly
And it's only
(And it's only)
'Bout me
When you think about me
Think about me

Oh, when you think about me
Oh, yeah
When you think about me
(Oh, yeah)
Think about me
Yeah, when you think about me
