
When I was three feet tall
I loved the mall 
And lived life for myself 
Fallin' down for laughs 
Your photograph 
Some puppets made of felt

Watching life in Oz Thanksgivin' Eve on Grandma's old TV 
Dancing roundabout, I'd twist and shout for everyone to see

Impersonality 
It's leanin' hard on me

Mama's in a shop 
Watching little sister by myself 
Robbed a wishing pond 
In a fleeting bond 
Vowed to share the wealth

Scooping up the coins 
A warning shot from some authority 
Doesn't matter now, but I'll shout out loud for everyone to see

Never got to know you 
Did you ever wonder why? 
Now it's nice to know ya 
And I'm glad you're doing fine
Think of all the time lost 
Was it really lost at all? 
Now I'm so proud of ya 
I'd love to tell you all I see 
Listen hard to your reality

Impersonality 
It's leanin' hard on me 
Impersonality 
It's leanin' hard on me
