Everytime you point your finger
Three more point right back at you
I'm not sayin' that there's something wrong with life
Cuz that's a sad excuse

And age old game of rat and mouse
Chasin' us from house to house
I'm not sayin' that there's something wrong with you
It's wrong with me as well

Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
Amigone

Heavenly intoxication
Love's been marred by medication
Ain't it funny how a life can take a turn
When the end is near

Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to face the truth that it was wrong?
Amigone

I'm not sayin' that it's nothin'
I ain't gonna play along
I ain't wishin' for a miracle
That miracle's gone wrong
And you're too strong

Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
Amigone
