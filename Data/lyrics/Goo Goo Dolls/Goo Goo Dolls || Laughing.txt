I wake up, I'm staring at the clock 
My belly hurts and my head is like a rock 
I get up to see what I can see 
Furthest I got was my black and white TV 
Eyewitness News brought to you at noon 
Oh my God, guess I got up too soon because

Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
All because of you 
All because of you

I didn't mean to wear this disguise 
But I can't stand the look in my eyes 
Oh, I didn't mean to lie 
I was doing what I thought was right 
Come on, walk right down the line 
You'll be walking 'til the end of time because

Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
All because of you 
All because of you

Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
Oh, I feel like laughing 
All because of you 
All because of you
