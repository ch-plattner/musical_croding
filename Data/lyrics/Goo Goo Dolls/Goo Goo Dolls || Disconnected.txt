
I don't remember
It doesn't ring a bell
And when you call me everything is swell

I tend to forget about the times we had 
And now it doesn't matter cuz I feel so sad

I've been disconnected 
Someone pulled the plug 
Oh, you're so distant 
Nothing's come along, yeah

We've paid the price and now we're both alone 
And if you call me, you'll find me home 
I've found another, someone to take your place 
Now if you don't mind, please get outta of my face

I've been disconnected 
Someone pulled the plug 
Oh, you're so distant 
Nothin's come along, yeah

Cuz, I've been disconnected 
Someone pulled the plug 
Oh, you're so distant 
Nothing's come along
