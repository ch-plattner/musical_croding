
Te amo, te amo
she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice..
then we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
that's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus:]
Then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no,
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
but let me go
My soul is awry,
without asking why
I said te amo,
wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you

Te amo, te amo,
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water,
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

[Chorus]

Listen we can dance,
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night,
I'm movin' to the night
because I understand
that we all need love
and I'm not afraid
to feel the love but I don't feel that way

[Chorus]

Think it means I love you,
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you
