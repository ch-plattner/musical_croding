How do I take it off if I love it on it's like a work of art
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap) [x2]

It maybe wrong but it feels right,
All my fears are gone tonight, I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

Lost in paradise, yeah
Lost in paradise [x2]

(Bass slap)
