Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]

It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Must admit it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

[Hook]

It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game
Baby here I go again

[Chorus]

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby here I go again

Here I Go Again

[Verse 2]

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

[Hook]

Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause you really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within

[Chorus]
