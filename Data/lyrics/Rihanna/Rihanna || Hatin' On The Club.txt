Now To Sing her new Recording,
The Beautiful, Miss Rihanna

Now this will be the last time you did me wrong, 
No more laying up in your arms, 
No calling, saying you want me back, 
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that? 

I stayed at home like a good girl do 
But tonight baby you got me sad and blue 
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar 
Got me crying, 

[Chorus:]
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club 
Cause you took my love 
Oh, you took my love 
Now you got me like Woah (Why) 
You got me Hatin' On the Club (Why) 
'Cos You took my love (Why) 
Why'd you have to take my love (Why) 
Woah... 

And you can be mad at me all you want, 
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front, 
Coming out the Door, With your girlfriend, 
You Did me Wrong Boy, Tell me Where our Love went, 

I stayed at home like a good girl do 
But tonight baby you got me sad and blue 
I just heard about the girl in your car, yall kissing at the bar 
Got me crying 

[Chorus]

Now this is the sound of a broken heart 
There's only one reason why we're apart 
She never would of made it to your car 
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love, (I'd still have my love) 
We would still have us, (We Would Still Have Us) 
I'd still have my love, (I'd Still Have My Love) 
We would still Have Us 

But now we're like Woah,
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club 
You took my love 
Oh, you took my love 

Oh Oh Oh,
You got her Hatin 
Boy, You got her Hatin on the (Ah) 
You got her Hatin 
Boy, You got her Hatin on the (Ah) 
You got her Hatin 
Boy, You got her hatin on the club, club, club, club
