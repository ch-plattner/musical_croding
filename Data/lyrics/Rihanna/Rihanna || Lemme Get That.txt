[Chorus]
I got a house, but I need new furniture,
Why spend mine when I could spend yours
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain you buying gucci babe

[Verse 1]
You might see me in the spot
Ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block
Ugh Huh you like that
know you wanna bite that
Ugh Huh yea right there
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young,if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep 'em singing...

[Pre-Hook]
Lemme hit that (Huh?)
(Justin What you got up in them jeans? Put it on me, or get lonely)
Lemme get that (Huh?)
(Rihanna You know, 5 car garages, name on your bank account, all day massages)
Lemme hit that (Huh?)
(Justin I wanna put it on blast)
Lemme get that (Huh?)
(Rihanna Better slow down, for I make you crash boy)
Got what you want
Baby got what you need,
But we can't proceed 
Unless you got that for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm a put you on the spot
keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a benz, 
You buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot, 
The girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (ya get it?)
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick,
and I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep em singing...

[Pre-Hook]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Boy I know you want my love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Nothing is free in this world
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Unless my love is your love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
I'm not a gold digger

[Pre-Hook]
[Chorus-End]
