
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Hook"]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through,
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true

[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Good Bye No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife

[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby goodbye
Never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
