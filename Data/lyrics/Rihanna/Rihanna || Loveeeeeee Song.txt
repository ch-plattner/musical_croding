I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want
Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily

If I'm your girl say my name boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I I I, won't play around
I I I, I wanna lay you down
I I I, I need you now, I need you now
Oh oh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Boy lately, you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want so come express it

Don't slip, don't slip
Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
I I I don't put it down
I I I don't fuck around
I I I want you now, I want you now, oh oh whoah

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Can you love me for poor (let me know)?
I'm searching for my soul
Whoever turned you cold (beat this)
You need to let 'em know
I can work miracles (what's up?)
I work it physical (physical)
And when I love you close,
You can feel my heart beating thru my clothes

Future...

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, l.o.v.eeeeeee and affection
