In a perfect world
We would make love over war
With our hands in the air
Got no problems no care oh no
Oh no!

Oh America!
Moving down to Africa
We keep singing
Now the world
Spining round and round
And round and round and round and round

We will dance in the rain despite all the pain
What the world really needs is to feel love again
In a world that it needs to feel love again yeah oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
And round and round
And round and round

In a perfect world
There would be no lonely ones
We would keep our hands in the air
Got no problems no care oh no
Oh no!

So London to Japan
Every Woman, Boy
Turn it man!
Come on come dance with me yeah

We will dance in the rain despite all the pain
What the world really needs is to feel love again
In a world that it needs to feel love again yeah oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round

We will dance in the rain despite all the pain
What the world really needs is to feel love again
In a world that it needs to feel love again yeah oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
Oh oooh oh oooh
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round
