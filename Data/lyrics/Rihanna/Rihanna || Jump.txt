Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love me
But I guess I guess I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering
Why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,

My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

Think I give a damn, boy don't you know who I am?
I ain't running around chasing no dude
Think somebody else like me gon' come around
Boy you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face but you're actin' all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance
Tell me what it's gon' be?

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

You say it's my fault, OK I get it
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it
See you put up your wall, you know you did it,
The rise and the fall, just admit it
You say it's my fault, OK I get it
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it
It's the the rise and the fall
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could've had it all

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump-jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump-jump on it
