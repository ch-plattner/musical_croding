I'm painting my smile, drying my tears
Covert it all (covert it all)
You wear disguise, hiding your fears 
Put up a wall

But underneath it all that love we had is gone
We already let go
But we put on a show so nobody knows 
Cause we ain't ready too fall

It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!

Your all that I know, so comfortable
But the feeling is gone
And even though we need more 
We're scared of being alone, so the show goes on

If we took off our mask then we could never last
Cause we'll be force to see
It's all to make be live 
Cause we're not who we use to be

It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!

I'm wiping my smile off
Letting the tears come streaming down
You take your disguise off
Bringing your walls down to the ground
We be screaming inside 
We can finally let it go
The truth is our now
We're face to face 
Time it put it into this

It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!
