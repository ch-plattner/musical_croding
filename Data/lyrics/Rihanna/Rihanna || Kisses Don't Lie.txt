
Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie

[Verse 1:]
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lusting

[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no

[Hook:]
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen
And its tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie

[Verse 2:]
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no

[Hook x2]
