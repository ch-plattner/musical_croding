Let me take a hit while you sit and rush
Go 'head, talk shit, it's all in the paper
Let me grab my dick while you sit on top
Do you right here while the whole world's watching
All up in my mental, gotta get up in my physical

Don't know what you did
But you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight
All on you, babe
Cause you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight
Up on you babe
Got me going cray
'Bout to let it go, let it go
Just show me where you want me baby
Can't fight the feeling
Cause you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight

Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(when I like, can't lie)
I just Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(Do whatever you like)
Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(You got my love tonight)
Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
