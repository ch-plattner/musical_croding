
Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to let him go

[Chorus:]
Ladies don’t worry cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry ’bout?

[Verse 1:]
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"
You got me mistaken thinking you gon get it easy
First of all you need to know that I’m not the one
Think you getting something baby, you ain't getting none
All you need to know that I’m a 2 times 5
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye
Set your standards lower boy you’re aiming too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better, so good bye

Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to let him go

[Chorus:]
Ladies don’t worry cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry 'bout?

Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]
Excuse me but who are you fixing to be?
Let them muthafuckers know there’s plenty of fish in the sea
And he sweating me just cause I got the tightest hole
Bet I couldn’t find that thing with a microscope
Give me dom dom, dadadada, dom dom dom
I ain't tripping on your money, money long long long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me Celie
Anyway Ri-Ri, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you want to sit on the back while I wheelie, really? really?
No for real, really?
Laid down on the beach, they be feedin me my catfishes
Cause it’s raining men
Fat bitches

[Chorus:]
Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry 'bout?

Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa whoa
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 3:]
I said hey, outta my way, where my ladies
Riding big, living good, doing they things
Dancing, don't pay,
player keep the money I can buy my own ring
Up in the club, see me coming
Dime a dozen so it don’t mean nothing to me
And I ain't even worried about you
Cause there’s plenty more fish in the sea, OK

Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to let him go

[Chorus:]
Ladies don’t worry cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry 'bout?
