
I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm ‘bout to leave town (yeah)

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

And I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, gosh
Whatever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger – boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Me say one man down (oh, let me say)
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum, rum, pum, pum, pum
When we went downtown

Cause now I am a criminal criminal criminal
Oh, lord have mercy now I am a criminal
Man Down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town none a them can see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
