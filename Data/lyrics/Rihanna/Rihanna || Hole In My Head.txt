You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl

[Rihanna:]
No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news, and
Probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interupt,
It's time to start me up

[Bridge:]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, don't start with me I got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you down

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body,
Let these ladies know
Don't bring this hoe around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
Wanna see me get wild

[Chorus:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run But you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you,
you got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment i met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Really take a lot to start me up

[Bridge]

Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wind
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right baby
So push my buttons
You see me get wild
Uh go wild baby

[Chorus]

Uh oh uh oh
Sometimes I go crazy
Uh oh uh oh
Watch me Watch me
Uh oh uh oh
Sometimes I go crazy

[Justin Timberlake:]
Break it down

I hear voices in my head
they go oh oh oh

[x6]

[Rihanna:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't heard what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

[Justine Timberlake:]
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
