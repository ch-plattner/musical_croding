I don't know who you think I am

He been gone since 3.30 (3.30)
Been coming home lately at 3.30 (3.30)
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you're gonna get it
Now I ain't trippin', I, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well just a little bit (huh)
I'm kicking ass, I'm taking names
I'm on a flame, don't come home babe

[CHORUS]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here
All night (uh huh)
I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man
A man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
Oh

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time and I'm bleaching ya clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning, is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe hes always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man I don't know
I'm looking round for something else to throw

[CHORUS]

(Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh)
I don't know who you think I am
(I don't know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
(Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh)
If you don't come I'm a huff and puff and
Blow this, Blow this, huh
Blow this, Blow this,
I'm a blow this, blow this, huh
Blow this, Blow this
I'm a blow this, blow this, huh
Blow this house, house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes

[CHORUS]

A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
a man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan

breakin' breakin' breakin' breakin' (dishes dishes, dishes) [x3]
