Teasin me pleasin me easily boy
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have it all the things that you do
I know  nothing
But this feelin is crazy amazin 
It stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feelin somethin that I can't understand
Its like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
Its your vibe
Its your style
Its the way that you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's so magnetic when you're here next to me
Pullin me closer happens so naturally
We connect
Its electric
This feelin inside
Couldn't hold it back even if I tried

Somethin bout the way that you're workin me

Boy your love has got me so hypnotized (no ooh no)

You got me spinnin like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin but I aint off the ground
Fallin fast

Can't escape
