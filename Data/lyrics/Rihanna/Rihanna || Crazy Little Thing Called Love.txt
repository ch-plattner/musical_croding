
Ooh Yeah
Yeah yea

[Verse 1]
When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

[Chorus]
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
whoa ho yeah

[Verse 2]
My best friends tell me Rihanna
what's got into you
I say LeAndra I can't explain
These feelings I'm going through
Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way
I try my best to wear a disguise
But it's written on my face

[Chorus]

[J-Status]
Yeah
It's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay
If you wanna
Come on my bajun baby
Let me take to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby you're my number 1 not number 2
So if its loving that you want
Baby you should make me your boo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy baby
I try my best not to show
But you know its so crazy baby
Crazy little thing called love
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
Whoa Yea
