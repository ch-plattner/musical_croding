
I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to wine down
And find ourselves a corner
Six pack with braids and green eyes
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (wining it slow now)

If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand her ma back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go
Here we go now

I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear
Torn apart this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (Oooohhh)

If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand pon her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go

Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
(And I'm going crazy)
Now your here
You can show me just how you do
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
(I've been waiting on you)
Now your here
You can show me just how you do
(How you do)

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow
You got to let now

If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand pon her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go
Here we go

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow
You got to take your time

If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand pon her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go
