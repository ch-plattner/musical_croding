[Verse 1:]
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need

[Pre-chorus:]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care (feel it in the air yeah)

[Chorus:]
She's a mean-eyed crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

[Verse 2]
Back on the dance floor better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hot blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, party's gettin' hardcore
Everybody's getting a little sexy off the crazy juice
This will end up on the news

[Pre-chorus:]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care (feel it in the air yeah)

[Chorus:]
She's a mean-eyed crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

[Bridge:]
Ultra-sexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh, oh oh, oh whoa, oh oh

Ultra-sexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum

[Chorus:]
She's a mean and crazy dita, disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
