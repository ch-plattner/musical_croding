[Chorus]

No no no
You don't love me and I know now
No no no
You don't love me so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby
I shoulda left you along time ago, no

[Verse 1]

Playas gonna play
a least thats what they say
Well I know that for myself now
(You know I love you)
You said you loved me babe
Then you played your game
A game that I know all to well now
Well I use to  buy your lines
But it's time for me to sail now

[Chorus]

[Rap]

First you tellin me no
But please tell me yes
without some of this stress
Straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest
As ya chest you got me feelin like i'm climbin on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna 
Your lovin really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
No no no

[Verse 2]

Haters gonna hate
(let them hate)
I found out much to late
I think I know were a little hot now
The truth leads to the lies
The heart aint always right
And I see that love is blind now
Boy you use to have my trust
Without no trust there aint no us boy

[Chorus]
