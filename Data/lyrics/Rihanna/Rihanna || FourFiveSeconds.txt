[Verse 1 - Rihanna:]
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Hook - Rihanna:]
Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]
Yeah I'm 'bout Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Bridge - Rihanna:]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so selfish?
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless?
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

[Verse 3 - Kanye West:]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
[Rihanna and Kanye West:]
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]
Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want
