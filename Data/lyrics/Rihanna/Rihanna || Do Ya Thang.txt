Know I'm missing that kissing in the Rover
Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over
And you my lover
But I love you like a brother
Babe you the one at the end of the day
You are who you are
And I love you that way
Lust ain't love, if you know the difference
You ran a little game on ya
Caught up in your feelings
We together like, ohhh

You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
This kind of love don't come easy
We don't care what they think
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me

See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at hips, and a little outfit
What can I say (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)
Yeah, I don't ask 'cause I know you gon' lie
You way too sexy, to ever be shy
What can I say (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)

Go ahead
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

You the shit
Yeah, baby you the bomb
Middle of the day
Give me what I want
It feels so special
It feels so good
And he ain’t going no where even if he could
I got that ow, ow
You know what I’m talking about, 'bout
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Every time the lights go out, out
We out, out

You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
This kind of love don't come easy
Fuck what you think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me

See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
What can I say (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)
Yeah I don't ask, cause I know you gon' lie
You're way too sexy to ever be shy
What did I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)

Go ahead
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

And I know what you thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do your thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need

Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
What can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)
