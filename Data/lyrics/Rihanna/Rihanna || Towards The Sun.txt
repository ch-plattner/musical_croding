[Chorus 2x:]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Tell a prayer, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold

And you know
I've been burned
I've been burned
I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth
It's not worth
It's not worth
My soul

[Chorus]

Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterday

Don't you know
I've been burned
I've been burned
I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth
It's not worth
It's not worth
My soul

[Chorus]

Where you gonna go
Where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the edge of the night
It's time you face the sky

[Chorus 3x]
