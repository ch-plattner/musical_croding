If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy

It's like spending (Time with you just)
Doing absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When your..at work (Puttin' on your)
TV shirt, and I love it
Absolutely love it

It's a smile of a child it's your eyes it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin that gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
that's nice

Just as long it makes you happy..if it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy

It's like walking (Threw the sprinklers)
Smelling every flower one by one
Makes me happy
Telling me love me
Showing you love me baby
My pretty baby

It's a smile of a child it's your eyes it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin that gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side

Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy

It's like saturday
Ohh four day weekend
Hiding and seeking with you
Let me do
Let's do it boy

Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy

Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
