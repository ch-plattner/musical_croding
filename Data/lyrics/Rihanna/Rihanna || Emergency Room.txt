Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shocking (shocking)
It’s on receipts here to say you went shopping (shopping)
You bought some Nike shoes
But why you buying stockings?

Boy how could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I’m not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'ma let it go
can't stand around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'ma leave your heart broken on the floor

You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m fighting with myself
I can’t hurt you even though you hurt me
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heartbeat
Flat line on the EKG

I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying RiRi
Saw your man in the club
I thought he was out of town doing business said he’d be back in three weeks
And now I’m mad
Sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures

Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I’m not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I’ma let it go
can't stand around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I’ma leave your heart broken on the floor

You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m fighting with myself
I can’t hurt you even though you hurt me
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heartbeat
Flat line on the EKG

I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listening to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper
You know them haters
You hear that 808
The drum, that’s my heart beat
I’m going numb, I said Rihanna, I’m feeling stressed
I’m going under cardiac arrest

You’re gonna be in the emergency room

You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heart beat
Flat line on the EKG

Flat line on the EKG
