
It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're
Feeling brave
There's so much power
In my name
If you pop off and you say it
Steady
I'm gonna do the wave

I'm such a
Fuckin' lady
You don't have to be
So afraid
Cause I got room
Up on my team
You can play
But hold up

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

It's getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova
Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together
We gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait
I hate to hear
That's such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway

I know you want to win
And you wish
I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play
But hold up

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

It's getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova
Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together
We gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

Baby put the work in
Like a champion
But the crowd is screaming
With their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way
I'll win

Baby got the whole world
Standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya
Took a chance on love
Baby love

The time is now
And now
The wait is ova

The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
(just wait your turn)
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
(just wait your turn)

It's getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova
Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together
We gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

Just wait your turn
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
The wait is ova
