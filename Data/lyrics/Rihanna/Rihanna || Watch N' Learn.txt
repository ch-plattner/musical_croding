
Won't say a thing,
About the way you love me
Except for, I like the way
I love the way you touch me

If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more

Imma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that

Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now

It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh eh eh eh

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay

Don't ask me if
You were the first to sleep here
Cause if he did, you wouldn't even be here

If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more

Imma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that

Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now

It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh eh eh eh

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay

Come put my love against your kiss
Oh na na na, la la la, just like this
No no no, don't be shy
Baby all I need
All do it on me
Like you aimed to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way that you please me baby

Imma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that

Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now

It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh eh eh eh

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
