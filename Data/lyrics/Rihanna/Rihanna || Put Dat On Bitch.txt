
Now you got me on my own
And I don't want to ever go
Now we're both alone
Don't think I'll ever want to go

Don't tell me you don't want it (want it)
I saw the signs you know I got it
Don't tell me you don't need it (need it)
Don't be acting like you're scared
C'mon put it on me tonight 

I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no
Tonight I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no

Boy, you can save me so you know
My body's aching for your soul
Unleash yourself onto me babe
And show me love in every way

Don't tell me you don't want it (want it)
I saw the signs you know I got it
Don't tell me you don't need it (need it)
Don't be acting like you're scared
C'mon put it on me tonight 

I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no
Tonight I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no

Don't tell me you don't want it (want it)
I saw the signs you know I got it
Don't tell me you don't need it (need it)
Don't be acting like you're scared
C'mon put it on me tonight, 

Tonight.. Don't be acting like you're scared come put it on me tonight

I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no
Tonight I'll smile on time so give it all tonight
Put it on me tonight till we're out of time
Don't want to hear you go, nah nah nah nah no
