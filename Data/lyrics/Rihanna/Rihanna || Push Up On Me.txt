
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'cause the beat penetrates my body
shaking inside my bones
and you pushing all my buttons, taking me outta my zone

[Bridge:]
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the room, my sexy little thing

[Chorus:]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
push up on me [2x]

I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase ya like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I could be the girl that'll break you down

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]

I wanna see how you move
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess
Baby there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come get me outta my dress

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
