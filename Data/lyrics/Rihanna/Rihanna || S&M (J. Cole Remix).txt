Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, na-na come on
Na-na-na, come on, come on
Come on, Na-na-na-na come on
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on, come on
Come on, Na-na-na-na

Feels so good being bad
There’s no way I’m turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure, ’cause nothing can measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more.

[Chorus]
‘Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Na-na-na come on, come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na) come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it.

[J. Cole]
Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn this up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped
Do you like rough sex, hit em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet
Let, let, lets go, you rocking with Cole, it’s the best flow
With the game on lock while them lamo’s watch
I’m on fire, they are not
I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you got bad, you only got badder

[Chorus]
‘Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Na-na-na come on, come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na) come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it.

S, S, S & M, M, M
S, S, S & M, M, M

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It’s exactly what I’ve been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Give my body some AHH, AHH, AHHHH,
I like it, like it

[Chorus 2x]

Na-na-na come on, come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na) come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it.

S, S, S & M, M, M
S, S, S & M, M, M
S, S, S & M, M, M
S, S, S & M, M, M
