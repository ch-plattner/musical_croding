De gal them rush to feel the ill touch 
Gal them ball and gal them a scream 
De think ita love but a lust, 
Thats why a bad gal beside is a must for I bust 
Shes the angel of me consious yo yo yo 

[Rihanna] 
Never thought that I could feel somethin so strong 
I wanna hold on to this moment before its gone 
I wanna hold your body close its callin to me 
And when i look into your eyes Im likin what I see 
Boy dont hold back from me 
Just give me everything you got 
I wonder I can keep 
I know your gunna keep it hot
