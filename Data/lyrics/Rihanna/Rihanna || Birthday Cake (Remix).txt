Come and put your name on it (put your name on it)
Come and put your name on it (your name)
Bet you wanna put your name on it (put your name on it)
Come and put your name on it

It’s not even my birthday
But he wanna lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way (the worst way)
Can’t wait to blow my candles out

He want that cake, cake, cake…
(You wanna put your name on it)

Ooh baby I like it, it’s so exciting
Don’t try to hide it
I’mma make you my bitch

Cake, cake, cake… [repeated]
(You wanna put your name on it)

I know you wanna bite this
It’s so enticing
Nothing else like this
I’mma make you my bitch

And it’s not even my birthday (my birthday)
But you wanna put your name on it
And it’s not even my birthday (my birthday, my birthday)
And he trying to put his name on it

Girl I wanna fuck you right now (right now)
Been a long time, I’ve been missing your body
Let me-let me turn the lights down
When I go down, it’s a private party
Ooooh, it’s not even her birthday
But I wanna lick the icing off
Give it to her in the worst way
Can’t wait to blow her candles out
I want that cake, cake cake….

Ooh baby I like it, it’s so exciting
Don’t try to hide it
I’mma make you my bitch

Cake cake cake cake….

Ooh baby I like it, it’s so exciting
Don’t try to hide it
I’mma make you my bitch

Cake cake cake cake….

[Chris Brown]
Doggy want the kitty
Give me a heart attack and throw it back
Now watch me get it
And I knew thiss but you the shit
Damn, girl you pretty
Blowing out your candles, let me make a couple wishes

[Rihanna]
Remember how you did it?
Remember how you fit it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come, come, come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake, cake worth sipping
Kill it, tip it
Cake, fill it

If you sexy and you know it
And you ain’t afraid to show it
Put a candle on my motherfucking back baby blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stats, bring the racks on my racks
Wrap it up, wrap it up boy
While I take this bow off
Talk That Talk, yeah I know I’m such a show off
Daddy make a wish
Put this cake in your face
And it’s not even my birthday

[Hook - Chris Brown]
Ooooh, it’s not even her birthday (her birthday)
But I wanna lick the icing off (the icing off)
Give it to her in the worst way (the worst way)
Can’t wait to blow her candles out
I want that cake, cake, cake

[Rihanna - Hook]
Ooh baby I like it, it’s so exciting
Don’t try to hide it
I’mma make you my bitch
