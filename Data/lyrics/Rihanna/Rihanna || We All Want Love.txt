
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

I can pretend that I'm not lonely
But I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself
Some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only been dreaming about

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for
Cause we all

We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
Yeah yeah yeah

No one wants to be left scared and lonely

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
Yeah, yeah we all want love

I'm able to close my eyes
Yet my heart's not so blind
I feel so entitled love owes me
I want what's mine

And some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give my last dime
To have what I've only been dreaming about

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for
Cause we all

We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
Yeah yeah yeah

No one wants to be left scared and lonely
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
Everybody wants something gotta want something
Yeah yeah we all want love
