
Another day, another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories 
The time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars 
Its crazy how we didn’t know then
That we’d ever be apart

I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me it’s incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don’t feel like Christmas without you, you 

Another tear, another regret boy, that you’re so far away 
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day
Remember when we took the sleigh ride 
Remember singing by the fire
There’s to much that’s in the daylight
I keep reliving you and I

I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it’s incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don’t feel like Christmas without you  

Time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn’t know then
That we’d ever be apart 

I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it’s incomplete 
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do, 
It just don’t feel like Christmas,
no it just don’t feel like Christmas without you, ooh baby

See I tried but it just ain’t right, right without you.
