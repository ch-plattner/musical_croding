[verse 1]
Baby slow down just here me out
Theres something i gotta let you know
No need push no need to rush
You know you had me from hello

[hook 1]
When it comes to my heart i dont play
Baby boy cant you see the stop sign
Your movin much to fast
Baby love doesnt grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

[chorus]
Baby if your willing to wait
We just take our time
Dont you know that its getting late
And i know whats on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
Its mutual baby
But we dont have to rush something real
Baby if your willing to wait
We can just take our time

[verse 2]
Boy cant you see i'm not tryna be
The girl who gets taken for a ride
If you take your time and you will find
Theres so much more to me inside
And just say theres no need to delay
Your telling me to trust you
Boy you know i want to baby
But my heart gets so recently break
Before we take this very far show me who you really are

[chorus out]
