
You say you love me
But they feel
Like words to me
Well this just
Ain't working
Stop thinking
You can run over me
Drifting
Settling
Off to
A foreign place
If I can't see
What's in front of me
It's a mystery
Well then apparently

[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
Cause I'm so fed up
You got me messed up
If we hooking back up
Don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away

[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for a change
Go on, begone, ta ta, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right I'll be gone by night

[Chorus:]
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
