Feels so good being bad
There’s no way I’m turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
Cause nothing could measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more

[Chorus]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

[Britney Spears]
Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me
Yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cos the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

Oh
I love the feeling
You bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It’s exactly what
I’ve been yearning for
Give it to me strong

And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah

I like it
Like it

[Chorus]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me
