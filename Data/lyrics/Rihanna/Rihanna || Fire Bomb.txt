
Yeah
Whoa
Gunfire left a hole
In the tank
Losing gasoline

Fire is on my trail
And he's after me
Hope it dont get here
Before I get where Im going
I gotta get where Im going
Take off my mask to breathe

You couldve been a apart of a
Masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leave
Thats the thing

Where I'm going
I dont need my breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold
But baby no
Doesnt have to be
Microwaving our medal tragedy
Watching it burn and
Its beautiful and its blue
And its pitiful
When its through
Its the other half of me

I didnt do it
You lit the match for me
Now were flying
From the blast, baby
Thats the thing

Where were going
We dont need no breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
Im coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby we were killing them
They couldnt handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
Im coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb
