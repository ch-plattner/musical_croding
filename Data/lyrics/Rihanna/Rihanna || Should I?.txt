[Verse:]
Boy you standin real close to me
Tell me now what its gunna be
You like what you see
But lovin don't come easily
Now you're whipserin in my ear
All the things that I wanna hear
Let me make it very clear
Words are not enough for me

[Hook:]
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style
But it dont just work that way

[Chorus:]
Oooh
I'm kinda feelin you right now
You keep me standin tight now
It's gettin hard to fight now
Still I wonder when should I
Oooh
You know they're playin my song now
You know you're turnin me on now
The feelings gettin strong now
Still I wonder when should I

[Verse:]
Back n forth
Baby round n round
So high that I cant come down
It's to late to turn back now
Still I'm scared to loose control
Feel the heat burnin like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop till the night is done
Hold me close boy
Don't let go
Still I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the mornin my true love is what I wanna see

[Chorus:]
Oooh
I'm kinda feelin you right now
You keep me standin tight now
It's gettin hard to fight now
Still I wonder when should I
Oooh
You know they're playin my song now
You know you're turnin me on now
The feelings gettin strong now
Still I wonder when should IIIIIIIIIIIII
