[Chorus]
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.
When the heat get too hot, they just keep turnin’ it up.
Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.

Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!

[Verse 1]
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
When you see both of us on catwalk representing our culture.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
Well the time and day has changed,
where the women wear the pants without changing the last name.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
Where the word diva, diva, mean viva, viva, we run las vegas.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
And then the stock exchange, bang, than we got claim to the change.

All, all, all a girl want, wants.
All a girl need, needs.
Its just all those, simple things like to be cared for.
Just to have him, be there for.
All that matters, it’s those sweet things.
That’s all a girl really wants.

[Chorus]
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.
When the heat get too hot, they just keep turnin’ it up.
Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.
When the heat gets too hot, just keep turnin’ it up.
Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!

[Verse 2]
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
We are too confident, me and her talk to phil, never happen again.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
We don’t wait, we get paid, for a trait holiday, we sip lemonade.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
Instead of doing what he wants, we do what we want, buying homes in geneva.
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh.
Like when the sound baby glance, rings, and that means more than things.

All, all, all a girl want, wants.
All a girl need, needs.
Its just of those, simple things like to be cared for.
Just to have him, be there for.
All that matters, it’s those sweet things.
That’s all a girl really wants.

[Chorus x2]
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.
When the heat get too hot, they just keep turnin’ it up.
Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!
Where them girls at. (girls at).
That like to be in charge.
When the heat gets too hot, just keep turnin’ it up.
Never let ‘em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard.
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off!
