[Rihanna:]
Baby you don't need to be scared of me
I guarantee that I'm not a mistake
I'mma give you all of my love
And I hope that you won't misplace it
You created this shit
Going insane with all of this fear
Can't turn my back on it
I'm in love gotta' face it

[Chris Brown:]
You're the only one I wanna stay on the phone with
Oh the late night Skype sex
On that young shit
Girl you keep it one hunnit
Always gon' hold me down
You know you're the number one
Girl I'mma work you out

[Chris Brown & Rihanna:]
Ain't got much to say
I ain't about to make you wait
I'm just gon' take you from here
Girl let's ride away
Let's elevate, just elevate
Yeah girl let me take you for a ride

[Hook - Chris Brown & Rihanna:]
Baby let me change your life
Promise it will be alright
Baby take my hand tonight
Let me set you free now
Sweatin' like a waterbed (on me)
Keep puttin' that thang (on me)
Like you never did before
I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there
Right there, right there
Put it up right there (I'm gon' explore all of your body)
Put it up right there
Put it up right there (I love, I love you)
I'm gon' explore all of your body

[Chris Brown & Rihanna:]
I'mma write my name with my tongue on your back baby
Come on, just let me
I know you're ready
And even if there is a crowd
Let 'em see it
I'mma give you some more
Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say
That's how I feel, cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up
When I'm with you, don't be scared
When I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbin' and kissin' and lickin' on your body
When I go down and oh I'm gon' miss you
Gonna need your body right now
Cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now
I can't breathe, If I ain't with you
I need your body like right now
I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed
Baby tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan

[Hook]

[Chris Brown & Rihanna:]
Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you
I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
Cause I'm in love
Can I get a little bit? One more kiss?
Yeah I don't wanna miss it

[Hook]
