Baby please, you don’t have to explain the reasons 
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons 
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name boy 
It’s okay, cuz what we got it ain’t gonna change boy 

As long as we’ve been together 
You’ve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 

When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school 
Memories when you were tryin’ so hard to play cool 
I don’t mind I know that you gotta go through your changes 
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it 

As long as we’ve been together 
You’ve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 

When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

There ain’t nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do) 
So when you realise you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to) 
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who be there 

You know I’m gonna be right there (right there) 

When your friends start to trip 
And your loosin your grip 
And u cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

When there’s nobody else in the world you can put your trust in 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
And you find all the haters around you, they don’t mean nothing 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
Who ya gonna run to?
