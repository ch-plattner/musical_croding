[Verse 1]
You said we girls but all the while,  you look at my
man with a funny smile. Now I don't look it might be me,
but ain't no need to bump so tightly.

That night we all hanging at the club. You tell mr. d.j.
wanna rub a dub. When I don't look you a chance to ask my
man to come and dance.

[Bridge:]
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot.
Don't even waste your time. Cause a love like ours is hard to find.
(Oh Oh Oh Oh)

[Chorus:]
(OH) Cause He's got me singing that la la la
(OH) our love is strong yes it's keeping me fortified.
(OH) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la

[Verse 2]
I hope you take this as a lesson learned. This ain't that
kind of party so just let it burn. The next time you see me
act like you know. I don't play those games, don't take me for a joke

[Bridge:]
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot.
Don't even waste your time. Cause a love like ours is hard to find.
