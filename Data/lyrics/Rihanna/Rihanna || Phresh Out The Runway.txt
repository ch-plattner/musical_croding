I hear you boy
I see you walk

Love it, then come and get it
I know that ya fuckin' with it
Ya see me, ya like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where the 40 at?
I'm fucking with cheap thrill on top of my 50 mill
He eating-the-cake-killer!

Own it, but don't kill her!
My jewelers are diamond rollers!
My rock... chinchilla!
Some more raw fun, I'm rolling like rock stars
I got 50 motherfuckers in my watch with my bentz down

Venus I'm outta coast, my bitches don't know
Fuck wit' her, my designer drip to the fucking flo'
Be out in that, they like em in all them honey stuffs
Monas are rolling loudies, and my bitches so Bvlgari!
Bodies of Dulcattis do what the fuck you want!
I bet you niggas gon' be like "bitch dis my fucking song"
How could you be so hood, but you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun, and sound like you selling rocks?

What's in the chain dollars?
What's on my chain dollars?
All of the bank dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars
I was in the back line, I'm standing in the bank line,
You throwin' up the gang signs
