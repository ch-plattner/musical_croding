[Verse 1:]
I rest my hand across your lips 
Feel your breath by my fingertips 
No longer can I delay what is right 
But this love it wont give up without a fight 

Id write a note and tear it up 
There are no words that could say enough 
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door 
But I swear its gonna hurt me even more 

[Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye, goodbye 

[Verse 2:]
Wish I could see your dreams tonight 
Wish I could make them turn out right 
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss 
But my heart tells me its better just like this 

So this is how the story ends 
When love is gone you cant pretend 
No matter who else I give my heart to 
There's a part of it that still belongs to you 

[Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye, goodbye 

[Bridge:]
You made me strong when I was weak 
Gave my heart a voice to speak 
You mustve known this day will come 
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no 

[Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 

You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye
