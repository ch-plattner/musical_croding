Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Your name
Bet you wanna put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Ba-ba-baby

It's not even my birthday
But he want to lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow my candles out

He want that cake, cake,
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake

Ooh baby, I like it
You so excited
Don't try to hide it
I'mma make you my bitch
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake

I know you wanna bite this
Its so enticin'
Nothin' else like this
I'mma make you my bitch

And it's not even my birthday
But you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday
And he tryna put his name on it
Oooh, I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body...
