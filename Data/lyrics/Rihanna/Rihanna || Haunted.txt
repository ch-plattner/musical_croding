[Verse 1:]
The steps on the stairs
Aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall
Whispers down the hall
When I look theres nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turn the page and closed the door
Can't get inside your head
'cause when I try, she's there instead

[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted

[Verse 2:]
You say that shes gone
That you've moved on
so why do I feel her eyes on me
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I've given up this war
'cause I can't fight it anymore

[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted

[Bridge:]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave
The walls close and then its so damn hard to breath

[Spoken Whisper:] There is nothing I could do about it...

[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted...

Haunted
Haunted

I don't want to fight anymore
Someone is walking out that door...

Haunted
Haunted...
