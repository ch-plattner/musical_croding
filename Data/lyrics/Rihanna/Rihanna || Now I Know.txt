[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there’ll always be a first time you get burned

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Hook:]
I don’t regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can’t you see
It’s the way it’s gotta be

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know
