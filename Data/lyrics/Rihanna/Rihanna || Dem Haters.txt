[Verse 1:]
I'm not concerned with people 
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad

[Hook:]
Get dem haters out your circle 
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down 
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Verse 2:]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you dont know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Dont be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They dont care for you
Trust me cuz i know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Hook]
