To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think you can take it
We say welcome to the Mad House

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh {madhouse}
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Come on, come on, come on in
come on, come on in {madhouse}

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh {madhouse}
Welcome to the mad house
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
