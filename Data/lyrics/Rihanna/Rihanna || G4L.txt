I lick the gun
When I'm done
Cause I know
That revenge is sweet
So sweet

This is a gang
Ladies' bang

Playing with fire finna get you wet
How it feel down there on your knees

Girls like a soldier
Trip and its going down

Girl I'm with you
If they get you

So come on let's go

Down for life
Load it, reload it and

Gangster for life
Till the day that I die
I promise I'll stand and fight
Cause you know that I'm down

Gangster for life

With them headlights off

Acting like a bitch finna get you hurt
Breaking lives down to their knees, oh
