
I just met infatuation
it's something in his smile
Your my obsession .... you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me

On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair awww

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now lets make it a sight to see, baby

On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
hands on this waist of mine.
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby

Doin it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do
I make it move
Got me whipping my hair, awww

We flashing pictures
Kodak moment memory
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world just for you and I

On the floor
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby

Doin it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk
so get up on it baby
I'm doin what I do
I make it move
Got me whipping my hair, awww

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
now lets make it a sight to see, baby

All them girls in the club
Get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy
Doin it right
All them girls in the club
Get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy
Doin it right
