Here's a little story I've gotta tell
Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing here
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I've got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
And baby I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
(When I was your girl)
This land is a better land
(When you're in my world)
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely... hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart...

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma's sofa
Girl I got this lovey dovey o my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin... Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl why couldnt I be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
I am not the one
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
You, you,
Is nothing without you
You, you,
Is nothing without you
All I've got, is nothing without

All I've got are these photographs

All I've got are these photographs
