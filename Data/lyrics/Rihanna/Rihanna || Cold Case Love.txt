
On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart & you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold & confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

Cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
