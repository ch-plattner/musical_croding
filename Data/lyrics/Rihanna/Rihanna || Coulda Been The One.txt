Looking back it's hard for me to see
Just how I could have been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow

I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy I think you need to know

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one

There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been
Shoulda been

My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the table's turned
I must admit I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance but now I'm long gone

(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one

You coulda been the one baby
(You coulda been the one)
Oh yeah

You played yourself boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed boy
Better go and lay in it
But know that you'll be laying there alone

You coulda been the one

(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one
