[Maroon 5] 
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away 
You say I'm not your type, But I can make you sway. 
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one 
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun. 

[Rihanna] 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). 

[Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before 

[Rihanna]
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind 

[Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 

[Rihanna] 
Sometimes you move so well 
It's hard not to give in. 

[Maroon 5] 
I'm lost, I can't tell 
Where you end and I begin. 

[Rihanna] 
It makes you burn to learn 
I'm with another man. 

[Maroon 5] 
I wonder if he's half 
The lover that I am. 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). 

[Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more) 
And I feel a little better than I did before 

[Rihanna]
If I never see your face again, I don't mind 

[Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 

[Maroon 5] 
Baby, baby 
Please believe me 
Find it in your heart to reach me 
Promise not to leave me behind 
(Promise not to leave me behind) 

[Rihanna] 
Take me down, but take it easy 
Make me think but don't deceive me 
Torture me by taking your time 
(Torture me, torture me)  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before 

[Both] 
If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight (torture me, torture me)

[Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
