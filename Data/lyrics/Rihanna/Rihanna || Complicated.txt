
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

Sometimes I get you
Sometimes I don't understand
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes it's you I can't stand
Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times punch you in the face
'Cause every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you
Take my heart from you
And you come running after me and baby I'm back with you

Oh, you're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

Sometimes I catch you
Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you
Other times I'm like where are you on the page
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated
My heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
