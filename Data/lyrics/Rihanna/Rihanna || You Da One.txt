[Intro]
You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is my love

Baby, I love you, I need you here
With me all the time
Baby we meant to be
You got me, smiling all the time

Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin, runnin
Tryin' to get away from loving ya
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm falling hard
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin wrong with that

[Chorus]
You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is my love

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is mine

Baby come, take me now, hold me now
Make me come alive
You got the sweetest touch
I'm so happy, you came in my life

Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin, runnin
Tryin' to get away from loving ya
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm falling hard
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin wrong with that

[Chorus]
You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is my love

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is mine

[Bridge]
And Yes I'm kinda crazy,
That's what happens baby,
When you put it down
You shouldn't give it to me
Good like that,
Shouldn't hit it like that,
Had me yellin' like that
Didn't know you would've had me coming back

You the one that I'm feeling
You the one that I'm loving
Ain't no other niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one
One, one, one
No baby just one, one, one
I bet you wanna know

[Chorus]
You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is my love

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
My love is your love, your love is mine
