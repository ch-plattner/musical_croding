
Yea, sing it with me yall, oh yea yea

Can we wait just a minute
Slow it down for a minute now baby
Your talkin loud
Your wilding out
Don't seem like my old lady
Lets go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame
Cause things just ain't the same

We can talk about the baby
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go to floor and we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with you man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move yea

Can we wait just a minute
Turn that TV off for a minute
Now politics and talkin shit aint really none of my buisness
Lets go and play the songs we used to play
On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul

Forget about the world
Im groovin with my girl
Froret about the news
Lets put on our dancin shoes
Lets not talk about the war
Do we know what they fightin for
I propose that we go to the floor and we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with you man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move yea yea
Move yea yea

I love it
I love it
I love it we're slow dancin together
I love it
I love it
I love it we're slow dancin together
I love it
I love it
I love it we're slow dancin together
I love it
I love it I propose that we go to floor and we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
Let the music make you move
