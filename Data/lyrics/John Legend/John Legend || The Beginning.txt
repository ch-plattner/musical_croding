
Last night was the last night
You'll ever spend alone
Couldn't wait
Did it in the living room
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby
Even if the world is crazy
Pick some names, boy or girl
Then we'll change, change the world

So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I'm ready, whatever time

It's the beginning of forever
You don't have to go
Sometimes you just know
It's the beginning of forever
It don't have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

Last time was the last time
I was worn and done
You the best, that's why I want another one
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Planned to take you to my elevator
And cook a little breakfast later
Pick a place and go there, girl
Then we'll change, change the world

So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I'm ready, whatever time

It's the beginning of forever
You don't have to go
Sometimes you just know
It's the beginning of forever
It don't have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
