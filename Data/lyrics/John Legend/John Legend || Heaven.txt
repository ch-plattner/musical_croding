
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began
Before it here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand

There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go
Will I ever know

Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance

Sometimes when we talking words
Drowned on by the sound
Let's get back to touching, we'll get back on solid ground
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love
Like way back in the day?
We can lose control, baby don't say "no"

Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

Will you come back to me?
Heaven only knows
Will you come back to me?

Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance

Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
