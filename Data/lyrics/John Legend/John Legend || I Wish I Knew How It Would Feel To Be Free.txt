[John Legend]
I wish I knew how, it would feel, to be free
I wish I could break, all the chains, holding me
And I wish I could say, all the things, that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear, for the whole world to hear

I wish I could share, all the love, that's in my heart
Remove all the bars, that keep, us apart
And I wish you could know, what it means, to be me
Then you'd see, and agree, that every man, should be free

I wish I could give, I'm longing to give
And I wish I could live, like I'm longing to live
And I wish I could do, all the things I can do
Though I'm way overdue, I'd be starting to move

Well I wish I could be, like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be, if I found I could fly
Well I'd soar to the sun, then I'd look down at the sea
Then I'd sing cause I'd know
Yes I'd, sing cause I'd know
Sing cause I know
I know I'm free, yeah
Yeah I know I'm free... [fades out]
