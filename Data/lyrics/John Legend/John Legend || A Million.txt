
Come back to bed
A million things in your head
I see the pain in your eyes
I'll stay another night
It's okay, everything else can wait
Everything pushed aside
Lose track of time
I know it's hard
Let down your guard
And I'll turn down the lights
So we can start

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Let's foreplay
I get you to bend my way
No reason to put up a fight
I know what you like
I kiss your neck
You probably know what comes next...SEX
Oh, yes
It's not so hard
Let down your guards
I'll turn down the nights
So we can start

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Just wanna get back home
The only love I know
You're the only want that can make me stay
Yeah
I could go anywhere but still choose you again
I can't miss another day

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
