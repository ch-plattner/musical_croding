
I see you in the lonely place
How can you be so blind
You still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think your so wise, your so wise

There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by
Oh darling, there is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You need to look at the other side, you'll agree

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you think your so right
You may never find a love that's right
