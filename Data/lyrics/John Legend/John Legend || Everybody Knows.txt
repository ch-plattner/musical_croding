
It gets harder everyday but I can't seem to shake the pain.
I'm trying to find the words to say, please stay.
It's written all over my face.
That I can't function the same when you're not here.
I'm calling your name and no one's there.

And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy.
I still can't believe you found somebody new.
But I wish you the best, I guess.

'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows,
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt.
We've heard it all before, and everybody knows just how to make it right.
I wish we gave it one more try.
One more try,
One more try,
One more try,
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows.

I don't care what the people say,
they're probably lonely anyway.
Baby, don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said.
It seems like you just don't know (don't know)
The radio's on, you're tuning me out.
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down.

And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy.
I still can't believe you found somebody new.
But I wish you the best, I guess.

'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows,
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt.
We've heard it all before, and everybody knows just how to make it right.
I wish we gave it one more try.
One more try,
One more try,
One more try,
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows.

Oh, I wish you would understand.
Just an ordinary man.
I wish that we have known
That everybody knows but nobody really knows.

And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy.
I still can't believe you found somebody new.
But I wish you the best, I guess.

'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows,
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt.
We've heard it all before, and everybody knows just how to make it right.
I wish we gave it one more try.
One more try,
One more try,
One more try.
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows.
