If you hear this message
Wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman
Calling ever man

We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday
And we're already late

We've been looking for a song to sing
Searched for a melody
Searched for someone to lead
We've been looking for the world to change
If you feel the same, well go on and say
If you're out there
Sing along with me if you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud if you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now...now...now

No more broken promises
No more call to war
Unless it's Love and Peace that
We're really fighting for

We can destroy Hunger
We can conquer Hate
Put down the arms and raise your voice
We're joining hands today

I was looking for a song to sing
Searched for a leader
But the leader was me
We were looking for the world to change
We can be heroes
Just go on and say
If you're out there
Sing along with me if you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud if you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now...now...now

Whoa now...now...now

If you ready we can save the world
Believe again, start to mend
We don't have to wait for destiny
We should be the change that we want to see
If you're out there

If you're out there
And you're ready now
Sing it loud, scream it out
If you're out there
Sing along with me if you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud if you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now
If you're out there
If you're out there
If you're out there

If you hear this message
Wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman
Calling ever man

We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday
And we're already late
