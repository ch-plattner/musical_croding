[Verse 1:]
Baby, you understand me now
Though somtimes you see that I am mad.
No one can always be an angel,
When everthing goes wrong you see some bad.

But I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good,
Oh Lord, Please don't let me be misunderstood!
Yeeeeeea!

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes, I'm so carefree.
With a joy that's hard to hide.
Most of the time I'm so full of worry.
And then your bound to see my other side.

But I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh lord, Please don't let me be misunderstood.
Don't let me be misunderstood.

[Verse 3:]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you know,
Cause life has it's problems,
I've got more then my share
That's one thing I never want to do.
Cause I love you baby.
I'm just human.
I have faults like anyone
Somtimes I'll think I'll spend the rest of my life regreting,
Some simple thing I have done.

Oh but I'm just a soul who's intentions are good,
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood.
Don't let me be misunderstood

Yeeeeeaaeaa

Don't let me be
Don't let me be misunderstood
Yeeeeeaaaaa
Don't let me be
Don't let me be misunderstood!
