La La La 
La La La 

Maybe, it's me, maybe i bore u
No no, it's my fault, cos i can't afford u
Maybe baby, puffy, jay z 
would all be better for u
Cos all i can do is luv u

Baby when i used to luv u
Theres' nothing that i wouldn't do
I went thru the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But i tired of livin this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realised that i just don't luv u
Not like i used to

La la la
la la la

Maybe, i should rob somebody
So we could, live like whitney and bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But u are, above cost
Cos all i could do was luv u

Baby when i used to luv u, theres' nothing that i wouldn't do
I went thru the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But i'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realised that i just don't luv u
Not like i used to

Hola hola hola
Hola hola hola

Do you remember when i used to luv u
Baby no not any more, luv u
Ooohhhh, I luv u
And you're gonna miss me now

Baby when i used to luv u
There's nothing that i wouldn't do, 
I went thru the fire for u, and i'm not gonna play the fool
No i can't live this life, and i can't justify, and i can't make up my life
Cos i don't luv u
Not like i used to do

Hola hola hola
Hola hola hola

Oh i used to luv u
Oh i used to luv u

Oh but I don't luv u
Oh but I don't luv u

Oh but you're gonna miss me now

Baby when i used to luv u, theres' nothing that i wouldn't do
I went thru the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But i'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realised that i just don't luv u
Not like i used to

la la la 
la la la
Oh i used to luv u
Oh i used to luv u

Oh but I don't luv u
Oh but I don't luv u

Oh but you're gonna miss me now

Oh but I don't luv uuuuuuuuuuu
