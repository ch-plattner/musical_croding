[Verse 1:]
It's a celebration baby, step out with me.
Draped in your finest clothes and accessories.
I notice you've been focused on the stress of the week.
But it's Friday tonight.
Spend the night out with me.

[Prechorus:]
Let's hit the party tonight.
That will be out of sight.
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight.
You look you're ready and right.
You showed me out of sight.
We're coming home late tonight.

[Chorus 1:]
We gonna do it right right.
We'll do it right right.
Our hands are sky high.
From left to the right.
Don't look that the time.
Just let it fly by.
We live the good life.
And we'll do it right right.
We'll do it right right.

[Verse 2:]
Ain't too fast or slow, it's just enough to get down.
Might be from the country but were going to town.
This weekend we can freak a leek all on the floor.
First get low, then come close.
Let the music control, oh.

[Prechorus:]
Let's hit the party tonight.
That will be out of sight.
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight.
You look you're ready and right.
You showed me out of sight.
We're coming home late tonight.

[Chorus 1:]
We gonna do it right right.
We'll do it right right.
Our hands are sky high.
From left to the right.
Don't look that the time.
Just let it fly by.
We live the good life.
And we'll do it right right.
We'll do it right right.

[Bridge:]
This is the last call.
Fill up your glass ya'll.
We'll dance until they play the last song.
It's the end of the night.
Now it's just you and I.
It's time for us to take this party back home.

[Prechorus:]
Let's hit the party tonight.
That will be out of sight.
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight.
You look you're ready and right.
You showed me out of sight.
When we go home late tonight.

[Chorus 2:]
Girl we gon do it right right.
Until the daylight.
We'll do it light right.
Yes, we'll do it all night.
Don't look at the time.
Just let it fly by.
Yes, we'll live the good life.
And we'll do it right right.
Then we say bye bye.

Then we say bye bye
(bye bye)
Bye bye
(bye bye)
Bye bye
(bye bye)
Bye bye.
