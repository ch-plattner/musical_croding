[Intro]
Good morning,
Good morning love,
It's my favorite love song,
I waited all night long,

[Verse 1]
Before you get into the shower,
Before you worry about your hair,
Baby give me one more hour,
I want you to stay right there,
I don't wanna lose a moment,
I don't wanna miss a kiss,
If I could plan the perfect day, love,
Then I would start it just like this,

[Chorus:]
Good morning,
Good morning love,
It's my favorite love song,
I waited all night long,
For morning,
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear,
I'm whispering in your ear,
Good morning.

[Verse 2]
Baby how can I convince you,
Make it so you can't resist,
Whatever else you have to do now,
It can't be half as good as this,
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love,
And I won't let you get away,
The day won't be complete, love,
Unless we get a chance to say,

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Open your eyes,
See my sun rise,
I feel your skin,
So warm inside.
Day breaks so sweet,
When you're next to me,
So stay every night,
So each morning will be,

[Chorus]

Let's get lost together,
I wish my forever [x2],
Was morning.
