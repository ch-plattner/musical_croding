[Intro] 
I don't wanna be what you want me to be 
So when I call you're just yelling at me 
I'm sorry it's my fault 
It's over 

[Chorus: Repeat 2x] 
Now what do you keep calling for 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
It's over, it's over 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 

[Verse 1] 
(It's over) 
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling 
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled 
I don't wanna be what you want me to be (don't wanna be) 
So when I call you're just yelling at me 
I'm sorry it's my fault 

Oh, the clothes I bought you could still wear (still wear) 
Did you destroy the cards and teddy bears (ooh) 
See there I go again sticking my nose 
I'm sorry it's my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey) 

[Chorus: Repeat 2x] 
Now what do you keep standing there for 
It's over, it's over 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
Don't you know it is 

Now what do you keep calling for 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
It's over, it's over 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
Yeah, yeah 

[Verse 2] 
(It's over) 
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough (strange enough) 
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful, yeah (painful) 
You know we used to talk about our future 
It ain't just all my fault (I know, I know, I know we used to talk about it, babe) 
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall (leaves would fall) 
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl (we would cry) 
Just say goodbye 
To the walks and talks and the dark in the park 
And it ain't just all my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey) 

[Chorus: Repeat 2x] 
Now what do you keep calling for 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
Oh it's over, it's over (over) 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 

Now what do you keep calling for 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
Don't you know that it's over, it's over (over) 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 

[Kayne West] 
(It's over) 
We lost a four leaf clover 
Don't ask why shorty be over 
News flash shorty we over 
We like Def Jam and Hova 
We like Bobby and Whitney 
Except without the kiddies 
Like Pamela Anderson's career 
Except without the titties 

We had some good times didn't we 
I know I won't forget that 
But we had some bad times and 
That's time I wish I could get back 
We coulda had it all 
But I guess we'll never know 
You been around me long enough 
To know that now it's over 

[Chorus: Repeat 2x] 
Now what do you keep calling for 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 
It's over, it's over 
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for) 

[Vamp: Repeat 4x] 
[Repeat:] (What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Yeah, it's nothing we can do with it 
So you might as well forget it 
Like we never ever did it, oh it's over 

Nothing we can do with it 
So we might as well forget it 
Like we never ever did it, oh hey 

Nothing we can do with it 
So we might as well forget it 
Like we never ever did it, oh 

Nothing we can do with it 
So we might as well forget it 
Like we never ever did it, oh
