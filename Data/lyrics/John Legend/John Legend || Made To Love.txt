We were made to love
We were made to love

You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love

Oooh I've never seen anything
In much more than you and me
Extraordinary machine

Oooh I've never loved, I've never loved
Never loved someone like this
All-I-know is...

I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love

You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love

All made for love, we were made to love

I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love

You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love

Oooh, have you ever known
We laid your eyes on
The perfect work of art
I knew right from the start
Oooh, I was never sure of a God before
But I know he must exist:
He created this

I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love

You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love

All made for love, we were made to love

I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love

You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love
