
A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right

And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

I'm not a one man band
I want to sing a duet
You and me would sound much better
You look so good in my bed
And if your gonna go out
Your gonna go on with a bang
Let's save the night I'll be your superman

And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

I see the night flashing before her eyes
Resuscitating bring it back to life

And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

Oh, let's save the night
Let's save the night
