(Oh Oh Oh)
She don't press me
Not like she used to
Everything that she don't do
That's what I want, what I need

Sinking rapidly
And that's when you sail through
Let me sail away with you
Everything that she won't do, you do for me

[Chorus]
Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby, I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say (say)
We're floating away (away way)
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I know that I'll be ok
Since you came yeah

12 am she leaves
She don't say where to
Won't see her again until 12 noon
And she don't smell like me

(Oh) suddenly I see
I see don't do what she used to
She's found someone who
Well, baby, needs you, so sorry

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say
We're floating away
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I think that I'll be ok
(Since you came yeah)

[Bridge]
Baby in all, we can just go
Can't stay, lets sail away
Open your eyes, say your goodbyes
We'll cruse into paradise

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say
We're floating away (way) (way)
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I think that I'll be ok
(Since you came yeah)

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)
