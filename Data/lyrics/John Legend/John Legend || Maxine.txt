
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

You should've seen the way she wore her dress
And her white stiletto shoes
You should've seen the way they looked on her
Just like the ones that I bought you
I searched for days on end to no avail
'Til I found them in Peru
She must've been to Lima just as well
Because she had them too
You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face
She looked as sweet as honeydew
You should've seen the way she walked away
Oh, she swayed her hips like you
I was only several steps from her
But she never noticed me
I took another sip of fine liqueur
It was quite a sight to see

I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

You should've seen the way he stroked her hair
And the smile that lit her face
You should've seen the way he kissed her lips
Did it have the same sweet taste?
Though my mid, it might be running wild
In constant search of you
It's funny how my eyes keep seeing things my heart
Would not believe are true

I happened to notice a man in a dark shade of blue
Who happened to be with a woman who leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, Maxine
