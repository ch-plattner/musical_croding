Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, yeah

We danced and sang somewhere in between heaven and hell
Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling, even through their tears, under a spell

But in Gabby's eyes, nothing 
I asked do you not like the music?
She said it's alright
But she dances to her own sad tune, she said

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby
Long as I'm there with you

I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares to live where you live
Tears well in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall

I'd give the world to know where her smile is
I asked will you dance with me now
Let me try to figure out
The fastest round out of town and she says

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you baby

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got a full tank of gas, girl
Anywhere you wanna go, girl
All you have to do is ask girl, ohh she said

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you baby

Come on and take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you
