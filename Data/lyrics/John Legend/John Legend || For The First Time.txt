
Is that music in my ear
It's like I heard nothing for a thousand years
My eyes were closed, locking in my tears

I was so surrounded but still all alone
A great big house but so far from home
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul

It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

I'm electric, finally exposed
You see through me, strip off all my clothes
If this is falling, then let me go, oh

It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

I'm finally awake and I can feel my heart
It's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh
Can you feel it

It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
