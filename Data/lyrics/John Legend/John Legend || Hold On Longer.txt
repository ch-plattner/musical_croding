Broken hearts rain on our angelic flies
But I won't run, I'm with you, that's enough
Kiss me now so you won't run

Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Love is an ocean
Swimming and try not to drown
Right in the waves
Praying we don't go down
In the undertow I'll pull you out

Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
I know the waves get stronger
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Hold on
