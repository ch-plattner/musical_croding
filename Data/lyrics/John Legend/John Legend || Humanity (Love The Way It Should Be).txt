Time is gettin' harder and harder
More and more each day, yeah
Still I am determined that I.'m never gonna change my way
Thinking 'bout love the way it should be
You gotta open your eyes and you will see
About love the way it should be
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
Coming from out of their mouths
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
We gotta open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

Whoa, yes, yeah!

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
That are coming from out of their mouth
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
Open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

Listen, people listen
You got the notion (I hope so)
Listen what I'm saying to you
You got the notion (I hope so)
A little bit of justice and peace
You got the notion (I hope so)
Bring a little love for everyone
You got the notion (our hope's on)
You got the notion
You got the notion
You got the notion (our hope's on)
Oh, get in the motion
Get in the motion
You got the notion (I hope so)
You got the notion
You got the notion
You got the notion (I hope so)
Get in the motion
Get in the motion
You got the notion (I hope so)
