Oohhhhhhh stealing moments just to be with you
Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth
But she don't have to know
She don't have to know

When I meet cha
I got my shades on to cover up my eyes
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by
Through my disguise
I still know you recognize

But you
I know you got a lil secret of your own
Sneaking out with me while your mans at home
You know your wrong
But its so strong still carrying on

I go
To the other side of town so I
Will never risk the chance of catching her eye
Cause she don't have to know
She don't have to know
Ooohhhh
Girl I know your doing the same thing too
But I wont tell your man the things we do oh no
Cause he don't have to know
He don't have to know

Someone's watching
We got to be careful next time or we're through
(creeping creeping)
Damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do
So sad but true
And I know one day
I'm going to pay

Then you ask me
To sneak out of town for just a day or three
(1,2,3)
Go to dc and hold hands publicly
All through the streets
Cause they don't know you and they don't know me

Ohhhhhh
Ill feel sorry for mistake we've made
But there's no reason that we should tell her today
Ohhhhh
Though you give a lot of love to me
Girl I know I'm not the only one you see
But he don't have to know
He don't have to know

Ohm its getting crazy
I don't want to hurt my baby
And I know its supposed to be the last time for you and I

But let's not end this way
Wait another day.
