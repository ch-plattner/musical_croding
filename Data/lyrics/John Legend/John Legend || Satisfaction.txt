[Verse 1:]
I wonder, wonder wonder 
Why your eyes they wonder? 
I wonder, wonder wonder 
About the spell that you are under 
Tell me its some hocus pocus 
Made to lose your focus 
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice 

[Hook:]
You don't love me like you say you do 
You don't want me the way that I want you 
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do 

[Chorus (x2)]
Can I get me some satisfaction [x3]
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you 
Give me the magic pass, that's all I ask of you 

[Verse 2:]
I wonder if it's over, middle of October 
I don't know why in autumn, she keeps giving a cold shoulder 
She knows how much I love her don't know what I could have told her 
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her 

[Hook:]
You don't love me like you say you do 
You don't want me the way that I want you 
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do 

[Bridge:]
Why don't you give me (give me give me give me give me your love) 
Give me your love (give me give me give me your love 
Is that too much to ask you can I 
Get some satisfaction from you 

[Hook:]
You don't love me like you say you do 
You don't want me the way that I want you 
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do 

[Chorus: (x2)]
Can I get me some satisfaction [x3]
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you 
Give me the magic pass, that's all I ask of you
