Every time I close my eyes
Visions of you come to life
And I see
What we could be

I don't want to be awake
I don't want to see a day
Dawnin
Like this morning

Sun brings llight
Reality strikes
So bring back the night
Cause I'm longin

To dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

If I dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you

When I dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Of you

Close to me
Still so far
Close enough
To feel your heart is falling
But he's calling

Baby it seems the time is never right
You're goin left and I'm goin right
It's crazy
But I'm still waiting

If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

Is dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

If I dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you

When I dream dream dream
Dream dream
Oh I dream
Yes I dream
Dream dream
Dream dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

Can dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

If I dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
It just might be
The only time
That Ill be with you

But Ill dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Of you
