
Ooooohhh...

Where do we go who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
(oh, oh no)
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can leave her no

I'll write a song
I thought about it for far to long
But I Never had someone to sing about
Until I meet her and each days get better
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now there I Know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me

Where do we go who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
(oh, oh no)
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can leave her no

She Wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love supposed to be
She wants it better
I want you to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I never leave

And where do we go who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
(oh, oh no)
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can leave her no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can leave her no

I Just Had to write a song about her
Tell her I don't wanna leave without her
Tell her that I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone

And where do we go who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
(oh, oh no)
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can leave her no

Each day gets better
I just can't let her go

Each day kiss gets sweeter
I just can't let her go
