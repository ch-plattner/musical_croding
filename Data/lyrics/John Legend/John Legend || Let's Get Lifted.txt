I've got something new for you
when it gets you wont know what to do
Relax, let me move u
dont resist its in the air
just one taste will take u there
let it flow right through u
I know ur getting tired of the same ole thing
Imma break the rules gonna change the game
You'll be screaming my name
and imma take u places u neva seen
u couldnt picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear you're here with me 

[Chorus:]
Let's get Lifted
(lifted)
ohh imma get u high
im really gonna blow your mind 
We'lll get Lifted (lifted)
Ur gonna feel it in ur soul
and baby u will lose control
we'll get lifted (high)
ohhh ohhhh

Once u take a hit of this
u wont ever wanna quit
you'll be so addicted
said I'll have u spinning round and round
crazy, making freaky sounds
you won't want to come down
And I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
even walking funny cuz ur legs are shaking
All night we'll be blazin'

I'll take u for a walk to the other side
we can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight we'll be alright

[Chorus:]
We'll get Lifted
(lifted)
ohh imma get u high
I'm really gonna blow your mind
We'll get Lifted
Ur gonna feel it in ur soul
and baby u will lose control
We'll get lifted (high)
ohhh ohhhh

So come and go
(so much I wanna show u I'll take u there)
Yeah, I'll take u there
lemme take u there
said I will show u 
(so much I wanna show u I'll take u high)
There's so much I wanna show ya
I'll take u high ....
