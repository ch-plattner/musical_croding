
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh...
You know we've been struggling for such a long time
Working here and there just to get by
It's finally time for me to get mine

No more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul (oh no)
Or going to Mama's house to make a phone call (no no)
No we don't have to struggle at all

Cuz now every day is feeling like Friday (Friday)
I'm getting paid and doing it my way (my way)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

Oh live it up
We can go crazy
Live it up
You and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high
Don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know
All over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

No more putting it in the layaway
Cuz Boo I got the money today
Come on and go to the mall and let's play
Let's go raise a toast to the days ahead
You can't take it with you when you're dead
You might as well enjoy it now instead

Oh now, it's about to be a long evening (yeah yeah)
We'll party through the rest of the weekend (come on)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

Oh live it up
We can go crazy
Live it up
You and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
(Oh we're flying high)
We're flying high
Don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know
All over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

We can fly so high
In the moonlit sky
Cuz there's no more cloudy days
It's so beautiful
When you feel the flow
We can dance the night away

Do you remember when times were hard?
Oh so hard
Through it all
We've come so far
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh
So we gotta live it up
So we can just celebrate there's no more pain
Raise your glass and feel no shame
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh
Oh so we gotta live it up

Oh live it up
We can go crazy
Live it up
You and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
(Oh we're flying high)
We're flying high
Don't wanna come down (yeah yeah)
We'll let 'em know
All over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

Oh it's time to celebrate baby
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh
We don't have to worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh

So does it feel good to you?
I know it feels good to you
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh
We don't have worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh
It's time to celebrate baby
Yeah we gotta live it up
