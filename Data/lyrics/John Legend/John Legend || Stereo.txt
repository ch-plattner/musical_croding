
She's a fast love professional, crafty bold and beautiful,
Stage right, locked eyes, I swear it's magical,
Her name is Melanie, says she digs my melodies
Likes how I move, thinks I'm cool that's what she says to me
Big stage, bright light, short love, long night
Frequent flights through the skies to some stars
I come back to town, she's hangin' around
It still feels so real but it can't go too far.

[Chorus:]
Her favourite colours be platinum and gold!
She only loves in stereo! She only loves in stereo!
I should know her kind, I've seen it before,
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..

Turn on the video, oh my goodness there she goes
Now I'm hot, seems I'm not the only one she knows
Name dropping everyday, I still want her anyway..
I like how she moves, think she's cool.. my favourite get away

Big stage, bright light, short love, long night
Deja vu, yeah, we do it again, off to the next town,
She's onto the next round,
Let it go, we both know that it's all gonna end, oh

[Chorus]

Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..

She fell in love with the radio
It wasn't really me, so I had to let her go
Just ask any DJ back in her hometown
She likes to get around
As much as she gets down

Her favourite colours be platinum and gold!
She only loves in stereo! she only loves in stereo!
I should know her kind, I've seen it before,
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
She loves in stereo
Think I gotta let her
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
She loves in stereo
Think I gotta let her
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
She loves in stereo
Ohhh ohhhhhh, ohhhh ohhh..
She loves in stereo
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!
