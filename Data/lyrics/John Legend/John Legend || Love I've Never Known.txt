[Verse 1]
street cars always get in the way
daylight enter us a starry gaze
she goes seems we ran out of time
but the memory left a picture on the canvas of my mind

[Chorus]
so I'll wrap myself in the thought of her smell
wish of our lips
locked in a kiss
she floats in to my bedroom every night
close my eyes
she's alive
here comes the morning but I'm all alone
dreams of her love I'll call my own
dreams of her love I've never known

[Verse 2]
new day, same hot sun on the street
and I say I wonder if we'll ever meet
then she goes
taxi steals her way
I keep tellin myself I'll find her love
I come back everyday

[Chorus]
I still wrap myself in the thought of her smell
wish of our lips
locked in a kiss
she floats in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes
she's alive
here comes the morning but I'm all alone
dreams of her love I'll call my own
dreams of her love I've never known

[Verse 3]
dreams of her love
will they ever come true?
am I a fool to dream of you?
you float in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes and your alive
here comes the morning and I'm still alone
dreams of her love I'll call my own
dreams of her love I've never known
dreams of her love I'll call my own
dreams of her love I've never known
