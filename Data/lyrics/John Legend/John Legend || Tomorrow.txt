
With good understanding and a lot of patience
You can make it, yes you can
Beyond your wildest dreams

Here we are in the prime of life
We're so ripe, yea the time's right
Here we go and we high off expectations
Let's not waste them

Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight then take it
We can make it

Don't wait til tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow, let's go
Don't wait til tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

Hesitation will only get you nowhere, don't just stand there
Every moment's a gift, here's your moment to live
Don't have no fear

Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight then take it
We can make it

Don't wait til tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow, let's go
Don't wait til tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

It's our time, it's our evening
Don't let it slip away, tomorrow's too late
It's our night, please don't leave me
If you're lost I'll help you find your way
Your way to tomorrow
Oh, don't you know we're gonna get there together
Your way to tomorrow

Don't wait til tomorrow
Oh we're gonna get there together
