[Intro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We can't run out of magic
It's the only way we know
Let's trip the night fantastic
Light it up 'til we both explode
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why'd we ball so hard?
Yeah, and I, I'm not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we're not afraid to die

[Hook: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
We've got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in a tuck
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook: John Legend]
And I, I'm not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we're not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I don't know about y'all, but I feel good tonight
There's something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
