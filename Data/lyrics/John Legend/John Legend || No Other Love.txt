[Chorus]
No other love
No other touch
Gimme gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on 

[Verse 1]
Won't you please get out of my head 
Get back into my bed now, come kiss me, come with me
Cause' I can't hardly sleep without you, can't stop thinking 'bout you girl
I want you, I need you 

And I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to lose control
Oh you know and I know that 

[Chorus]
No other love
No other touch
Gimme gimme oh so much 
Turn me on, turn me on 
No other kiss
No one like this
Feeling that I can't resist 
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on 

[Verse 2]
I had my share of lovers 
But there is no other girl, you're special, now let's go 
Cause now I want you more than ever, want to do whatever now
To keep you, I need you 

And I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to lose control
Oh you know and I know that 

[Chorus]
No other love
No other touch
Gimme gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on 
No other kiss
No one like this 
Feeling that I can't resist
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on 

[Estelle] 
I say you're turning me on now, say you're turning me oh-oh-oh-on 
Say you're turning me on from your smile, to your lips, to the words of this song I know 
I used to say I was too young, now I'm grown up 
But I put you where you need that strong, real goodie good loving 
Stevie wonder said it's been so long 
And I'mma give it if you need it are you ready to receive it 
Boy I-I-I-I-I wanna give you some love,
I wanna give you some love and affection, you got my attention 

See I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to lose control 
Oh you know, and I know that 

[Chorus]
No other love 
No other touch
Gimme gimme oh so much 
Turn me on, turn me on 
No other kiss
No one like this
Feeling that I can't resist 
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
