I'm so, excited
I'm home, been grindin'
Let's go, tonight
Just make some money you know
I've got it, if you want it
If you love it
I'm on it, I'm on it
So come on it
I need your loving tonight

I'm tired of my job
I'm tired of my boss
I'm taking you out
You taking it off
Only thing on my mind is how we bout to get it on

I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
I'm tryin' get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe

Now we got time
Let's stay in
I'm sayin'
I'm a make her stay home from church
I'm prayin'
I finally got to take the night off
So we can make some love tax right offs
We'll light some candles with the lights off
So we can set the mood right off

I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
I'm tryin' get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe

I'm so, excited
I'm home, been grindin'
Let's go, tonight
Just make some money you know
I got it
If you want it
If you love it
I'm on it, I'm on it
So come on it
I need your loving tonight
I need your loving tonight
I need your loving tonight

I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
I'm tryin' get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe

I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
I'm tryin' get caught up in your love tonight
I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
