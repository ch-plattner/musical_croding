[Verse 1]
Late in the evening 
City sleeping 
All through the night 
This feeling’s creeping on me 
So ready 

Soul is waiting 
Body’s aching 
Caught and imprisoned 
My own making 
I’m so, so ready 
I’m so gone, come get me 
Won’t you come? 

[Chorus]
Set me free 
Make me yours again 
(Free) 
In your arms again 
(Free) 
Won’t you come and dance with me 

[Verse 2]
Throw out the lifeline 
I’ve been sinking 
Going out of my mind 
I’ve been thinking 
If I could hold her 
Make this storm blow over 

Give me a taste of satisfaction 
Oh, I need to learn her 
I need her faster 
I’m so wide open 
Won’t you come right over? 
Won’t you come? 

[Chorus]
Set me free 
Make me yours again 
(Free) 
In your arms again 
(Free) 
Won’t you come and dance with me 

[Bridge x2]
I’ve been looking for a light 
Let it shine 
Let it shine 
You’ve been running through my mind 
All this time 
All this time 

[Outro]
Set me free 
Free… 
I feel like… 
Oh, to be free…
