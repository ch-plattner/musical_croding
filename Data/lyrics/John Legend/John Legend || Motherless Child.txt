WHOOAOO

Sometime I feel
Like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child
And sometimes I feel
Like a motherless child
A long...long way...from home

WHOOAOO

And sometimes I feel
Like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm all alone
A long...a long way...from home

WHOOAOO, WHOOAOO, WHOOAOO
C'mon, C'mon

Whoâ€™s got a shoulder when I need to cry
I feel restless and I don't know why
Cry for help, but still feel alone
Like a motherless child along way from home
Lord I'm lost I can't find my way
I'm dealing with the struggles in my day to day
My soul is weak and I wanna be strong
I try to run away but I've been running too long

I've been running too long
I've been running too long
I've been running too long
Like a motherless child 
Like a motherless child 
Like a motherless child 
WHOOAOO Like a motherless child 
WHOO Like a motherless child 
WHOO Like a motherless child 
Like a motherless child...
