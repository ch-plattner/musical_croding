
Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go crazy

In a state of madness
Wrapped up in your magic
Ecstatic, an addict
Oh, we landed on another planet
And it feels like home here
Will never go back there

Cause we're crazy, I'll go crazy with you
You're so crazy, I'll go crazy with you

Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go, go

To the edge of reason
Grow, lose your mind when needed

Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go crazy

Can't nobody save me
I'll go down with you, baby
I'll take you, you'll take me

Crazy - I'll do crazy with you
Let's go crazy, I'll go crazy with you

Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our loves an asylum
Where we go, go, go crazy
