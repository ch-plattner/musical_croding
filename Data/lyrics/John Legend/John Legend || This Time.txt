[Verse 1]
Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
It's starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realized I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But I just let love go to waste
It's so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
I gotta get you back today

[Chorus]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me.

[Verse 2]
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it
I'm left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight?
Is there someone new now?
What can I do now?
'Cause I need you back by my side.

[Chorus]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me.

[Bridge]
Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more mature
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up and let you go
I need you
Don't say no.

Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home?

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me.

All of me yeah
