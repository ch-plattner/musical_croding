[Verse 1]
Only just a friend the love story begins
Now here's a happy ending to believing
You're always down for me now you're with me in my dreams
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
I don't wanna risk losing everything
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking
Girl

[Chorus]
You've been my best friend can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my homegirl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you tonight
I, I, I...

[Verse 2]
Kiss, kiss, kiss me on my lips
We've been dancing round the moment now we're doing it
Then breathe, breathe a sigh of sweet relief
We've been holding it so long the wait was killing me
Oh and we are what we have been waiting for
So baby, open your mind while I close the door
Oh girl

[Chorus]
You've been my best friend can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my homegirl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you tonight
I, I, I...

[Bridge]
Don't let this moment just slip away
'Cause we'll never know unless we try it someday
If you're ready, I'm so ready
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Oh Girl

[Chorus]
You've been my best friend can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my homegirl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you tonight
I, I, I...
