You’re everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You put your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

Yeah

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home 
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

You're the girl

Gave you everything I love
You think that’s something baby
You think that’s something baby
You're the girl
You’re the one
Gave you everything I love
