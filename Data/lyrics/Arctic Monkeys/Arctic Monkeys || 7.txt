Well I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Was gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all

Well I'm looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You probably didn't give me the eye but I'm sure you did

Well I went outside
Couldn't say I tried
And I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet

But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well I dashed around tried to find you
But you were, nowhere to be seen
Oh no no...

(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)

Well she moved in ways, that kept her there
In our minds for days
And weeks and months
I was that amazed
And there she stayed
Surrounded by the what if's and the maybe's
