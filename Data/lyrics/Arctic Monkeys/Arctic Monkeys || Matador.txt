She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl,
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several once
A terrible dilemma and forever he’ll regret this day he didn’t make the
Rescue from the bull ring
Sulking won’t get you nowhere son,
There’s blood on your chin where you’ve bitten your tongue
Smitten but might not be smitten for long if you’re still sitting she’ll soon
Be smitten and gone
