
Won't somebody let me out?
Don't want to stick around no more
Sick of looking at you strange
Sick of sticking to the floor

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Well fuck it all and break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
If they keep on stepping on your toes
And pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya, no
Said not one of you, no
