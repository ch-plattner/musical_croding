[Miles Kane:]
Swinging room to room
Planting something new
I've ridden the riddle, I'll do it again
Back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

Riding through the gloom
Something beautiful

[Alex Turner:]
He's ridden the riddle, he'll do it again
He's going back to the Wirral where it all began

[Both:]
Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

[Miles Kane:]
I tried it and I liked it but
It just never gets close enough

[Both:]
Send a letter to me, baby

(Wirral)
So tell me where have you been?
(Wirral)
Little illusion machine
(Wirral)
Hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

Wooow!
