
Open Sesame (We've places to go)
We've people to see (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you had to escape, say the word

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
But with the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move and you'll probably be leaving soon
So I'm telling you

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you

Eyes the color of
(Water left in mud)
Ice and sugar dust
(Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps rolling

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both ought put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
