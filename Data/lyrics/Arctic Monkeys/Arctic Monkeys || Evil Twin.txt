
You've never met before,
But still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll,
She's definitely one of those,
But you'll go wherever she goes,

And when my body and my mind,
Both start talking at the exact same time,
Trying to think of ways to make her mine,
Bit difficult to find.

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give it to me.

She said...

"Oh, well I know this will sound cold,
But I really have to go,
Oh, it's not that I'm not free,
There's nowhere I need to be,
It's just your love's not what I need,
So don't give it to me."

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give to me.

She said "Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck? "
No point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck.

It's more a hunger than a thirst,
You'll break it out the second time,
Before you know about the first,
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch,
But you'll let her do your worst.

And it's not hard to tell,
It's obvious the other angels faces fell,
When she told them that she had to go,
Trade her wings and overcoat for something colourful.

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give to me.

[x3:]
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give to me.

No, your love's not what I need.
