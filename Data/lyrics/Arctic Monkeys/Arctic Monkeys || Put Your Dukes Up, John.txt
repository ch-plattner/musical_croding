
Just put your dukes up, John,
Yeah, put your dukes up, John,
You were preened and sanitized
Struck dumb by good advice

Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracized him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

Chang your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John,)
(Be a C-Y-N-I-C)
