
Both sides, and softly came the growl from both sides 
And if his whisper splits the mist 
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss 

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try 
Turned your legs to little building blocks 
And with his index finger flicks you on your socks 

I'll go high pitched, he'll talk and make you voice sound high pitched 
Dread to think if he got you on your own 
And whispered in your ear in that baritone 

It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone 
That they used to calve his jaw, it's impossible not to feel inferior 

And he could catapult you back to your daddy 
Or into any hissing misery 
And he will tear you out the day after a triumph is as hollow 
As the day after a tragedy 
He'll extinguish any chance of escape 
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape 
And he's leaving without saying 'Bye' 

And you would queue up to listen to him pissing 
And hang around to watch some poor girl bluff 
And then they chase him down the avenue 
Incessently pestering him to let him join the club 

He knows how to put a cork in the foot 
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us 
And they've seen him talking to your lady friend 

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal 
Where he'll teach you all the bits they missed 

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try 
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try 
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try 
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try 

You cannot turn away
