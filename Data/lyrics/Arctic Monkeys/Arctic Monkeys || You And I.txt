
I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't try and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I'm in a muddle tonight
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

I had a woman, she went away
And now I'm lonely...Fuck it

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't go and turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not long crazy
Girl, I'm in a muddle tonight
