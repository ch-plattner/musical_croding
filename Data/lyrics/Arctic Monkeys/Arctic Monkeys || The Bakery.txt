
I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At some mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet it surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with a mind on clever lines
Why not the rounder's pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
(To give me the invite don't worry it's alright)

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me
