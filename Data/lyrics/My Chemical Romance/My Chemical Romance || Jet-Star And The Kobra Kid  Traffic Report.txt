
Bad news from the zones, tumbleweeds.
It looks like Jet-Star and the Kobra Kid had a clap with an Exterminator
That went all Costa Rica,
And uh,
Got themselves ghosted.
Dusted out on Route Guano.
So it's time to hit the red line
And up-thrust the volume out there.
Keep your boots tight,
Keep your gun close,
And die with your mask on if you've got to.
Here
Is the traffic...
