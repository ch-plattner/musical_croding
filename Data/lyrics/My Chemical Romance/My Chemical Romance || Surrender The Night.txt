Everyone's a passenger tonight,
Just another accidental on the freeway of this life.
We'll drive on, and on, and on, and on.
We'll drive on, and on, and-
I'll remember this night when you're gone

You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to-

Just another surgery tonight,
Well if you amputate the loneliness,
Anesthesia dims the lights.
So dream on, and on, and on, and on.
So dream on, and on, and-
I'll remember your eyes when you're gone

You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me

And I'll watch you in your sleep
'Cause tonight belongs to me
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to...

Sparks against the railing,
Distant phantoms wailing.
Through the windshield sailing,
With these airbags failing.

Now you surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me

And I'll watch you in your sleep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me,
But tonight belongs to me,
But tonight belongs to me.
