
Gonna take off all my skin,
Tear apart all of my insides,
When they rifle in,
Mom and Dad think you'll be saved,
They never had the time,
They're gonna medicate your lives,
You were always born a crime,
We salute you in your grave.

Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know,
What I'd do just to get back in her arms,
Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know,
What I'd do just to get back in her arms.

(Well my gun fires
seven different shades of shit,
So what's your favorite color, punk?)

Do you wanna hold my hand?
Could you sign this photograph,
'Cause I'm your biggest fan,
Would you leave me lying here?

We're not here to pay a compliment,
Or sing about the government,
Oxycontin genocide,
Adolescent suicide,
I'll give you my sincerity, 
{Don't give} a fuck about a Kennedy,
Here's what I've got to say.

Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know,
What I'd do just to get back in her arms,
Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know, 
What I'd do just to get back in her arms.

No way home why

We've got to go 
[x7] 

Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know, 
What I'd do just to get back in her arms,
Can't find my way home,
But it's through you and I know, 
What I'd do just to get back, well, in her arms.

I can't find the way 
[x6]

Come on angel, don't you cry
