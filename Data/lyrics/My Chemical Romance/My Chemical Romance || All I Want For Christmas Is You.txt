I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking way above the fireplace
Santa Clause won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day
And I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

I wont ask for much this Christmas
I wont even wish oh I wont even wish. I wont even wish for snow.
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I wont make a list and send it to the North Pole for St Nick
Wont even stay awake to hear the magic reindeer play

Cause I just want you here tonight, 
Holdin on to me so tight
What more can I do
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, oh baby
Oh our lives are shinin surrounding everywhere 
Where the sounds of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singin' oh I hear those sleigh bells ringin'
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need
Wont you bring back my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm askin for
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, its you, you, oh baby
All I want is you [x4]
You, you, you, you, you
