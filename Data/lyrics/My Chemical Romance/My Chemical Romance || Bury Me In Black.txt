
I said, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
White lies, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time

Just give us war-worn lipstick by the door if I inflame

These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light

Just give us war-worn, I've been calling you all week
for my shotgun

Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone, fucker

I wanna see what your insides look like (I wanna see what your insides look like)
I bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (Not so pretty)
I wanna see what your insides look like (Not so pretty baby)
I wanna see 'em (Not so)

Well you don't say
And well I can explain what happened to my faith
Late last night
I sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm going through, shot lipgloss through my veins
And when I can't complain
With the falling rain

C'mon

I wanna save your heart
I wanna see what your insides may be
