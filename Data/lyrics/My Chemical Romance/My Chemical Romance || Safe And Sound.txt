
And all my hopes and dreams-
aren't for anyone 
I keep them safe and sound 

And all these victories-
not yours anymore 
Well can you hear me now? 

The dead stop dreaming-
I'll set ablaze this life 
Your shadow keeps me bright 

So try and stop me-
or suffocate this light 
Because I can burn all night 

Until, my heart stops beating 
You'll never hear me say-
I'm backing down 

If I say- 
It's lost it's meaning 
If I can't find my way-
It's over, now 

But I won't 
walk away 

Till the day 
Woah-oh, Woah-ooh 
I'm never backing down 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh. 
And hear me say 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh! 
I'll keep it safe and- 

This hopeless feeling 
This fear of falling down-
but I'm not crashing now 

For all this bleeding 
It wasn't worth the sound-
of millions screaming out 

And still 
The end comes reeling 
The curtain calls my name-
I'm not afraid 

And I know 
You may not miss me 
But I am not ashamed-
the choice I've made. 

But I can't let this go 

Till the day 
Woah-oh. Whoah-ooh 
I'm never backin down 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh. 
Just hear me say 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh 
I'll keep it safe and sound 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh! 
I'll keep it safe and - 

Like a crashing car or dying star 
That's racing to the ground 
Like the final words of the passengers 
With the engines giving out 

Will the world watch us burn 

Til the day 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh 
I'm never backing down 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh 
Just hear me say 
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh
I'll keep it safe and sound
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh
I'll keep it safe and sound
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh
I'll keep it safe and sound
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh
I'll keep it safe and sound
Woah-oh. Woah-ooh 
I'll keep it safe and sound
