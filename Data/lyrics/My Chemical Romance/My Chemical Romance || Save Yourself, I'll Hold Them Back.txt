Are y'all ready where you are?
Are y'all ready where you are?
Are y'all ready where you are?

Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

Right now,
I hope you're ready for a firefight
'Cause the devil's got your number tonight
(They say!)
"We're never leaving this place alive"
But if you sing these words, we'll never die

Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life
Because this ain't a room full of suicides
We're believers, I believe tonight

We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time

Na na na na na, na na na na na
If you save yourself tonight
Na na na na na, na na na na na
If you save yourself tonight

I'll tell you all how the story ends
Where the good guys die and the bad guys win
(Who cares?)
This ain't about all the friends you made
But the graffiti they write on your grave

For all of us who've seen the light
Salute the dead and lead the fight
Hail, hail!
Who gives a damn if we lose the war?
Let the walls come down, let the engines roar

We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time
(Whoa!)
I'm the only friend that makes you cry
You're a heart attack in black hair dye
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight

Are y'all ready where you are at?
If you save yourself tonight
('Cause we're coming for you)
Can you save yourself tonight?
Right now!
'Cause I'll hold them back!

We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time
You motherfucker! (Whoa!)
You're the broken glass in the morning light
Be a burning star if it takes all night
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight

Na na na na na, na na na na na
(If you save yourself tonight)
Na na na na na, na na na na na
(Can you save yourself tonight?)
