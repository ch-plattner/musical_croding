
Salutations,
From a greater northwest alley and
Reservations,
Every person goes to steak house 8 P.M.

You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands
(I’ll turn it into seduction)
I’ll turn it into some facts

Medication,
And the way your eyes look into me,
Lubrication,
Can you turn off all the lights so I can’t see?

You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands

(And dressin’ up like a crow)
And turnin’ into some rats

X-O, X-O, X-O, X-O,
X-O, X-O, X-O, X-O!

You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
He’s got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
They got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands
(I’m drowning innocent wolves)
I’m dressin’ up like a cat
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got them rickety hands,
You got your rickety bones I got my rickety hands

So fucking old,
I’m so fucking alone
