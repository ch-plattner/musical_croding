Yeah I drink juice when I'm killing cause it's fucking delicious

Hiding in the portrait our atomic stun
When I get the dirt we'll comeallylution ?

We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

Stretching out my style free find my own blood
Better bought their soul but they think it's a dud

We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa

1-2-3-4 
Bass!
1-2-3-4

Hiding in the portrait our atomic stun
Take me to a time of come all-ly lution

We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa

We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
