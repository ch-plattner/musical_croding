I don't like being alone
Run up these streets
Turn up the stereo
Synthetic animals like me never have a home
I'm not the one you will be walking through
And if you kill him for me
Well, then I'll kill him for you

I'll meet you down at the metro station
'Cause motherfuckers got the motivation 
Now I'm gonna show you how much I love you
Oh, my magazine is full of ugly things

Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll find it on the wall
I hope you die

Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try

Oh ah

Sometimes I sleep
I like to talk about television
Oh, I'm so glad right now
Heartbreak, heartbeats
Got the eyes on you
And give us something to say
'Cause I got something to prove

I don't have much of an education
But I got a knack for elimination
Now turn up the dial
Hit the tires that screech
Let's go
Right here
Right now
This is the bonus stage!

Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll find it on the wall
I hope you die

Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try

I want annihilation
A new design for X and Y
I want your violation
Deflect the system with our mind
Exterminate the dream
Extermination you can buy

Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll find it on the wall
I hope you die

Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can...

I hate you
Kill everybody!
I hate you
Kill everybody!
