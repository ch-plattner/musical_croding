
Turn away,
If you could get me a drink 
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded 
Call my aunt Marie
Help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors, 
My sisters and my brothers, still, 
I will not kiss you, 
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you. 

Now turn away, 
'Cause I'm awful just to see 
'Cause all my hairs abandoned all my body, 
Oh, my agony, 
Know that I will never marry, 
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go
It just ain't living
And I just hope you know

That if you say (if you say)
Goodbye today (goodbye today)
I'd ask you to be true (cause I'd ask you to be true)

'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
