
They wanna grip the cross,
Make cavities,
Adjust because it purely is a crime
We full-on freak the cops, that causality
And break the walls of cryogenic slime

She said come on, come on, kiss my battery,
Come on, come on, I’ll be your android girl,
She said come on, come on, kiss my battery,
Come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world

Turn up the fakes and lies, just answer me,
You stare me down and take my only guise
They need the ones you got,
And laugh for me,
Destroy the council while your mother cries

She said come on, come on, kiss my battery,
Come on, come on, I’ll be your android girl,
She said come on, come on, lick that battery,
Come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world

We all gotta die,
but tonight we’d sell our skins to meet you right,
We all gotta try,

I’ll be red with another arms,
with another slide
I don’t wanna know, I don’t wanna go,
I don’t gotta know where I’m gonna die
I don’t wanna know, I don’t wanna go,
I don’t gotta know where I’m gonna die

Scratch them all,
Spit casually
A heart,
You got it in the one you need
I’m at a loss, because of tragedy,
For what you got I got the ones you need
She said come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world,
She said come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world
She said come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world
She said come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world
She said come, come on just spit causally,
Come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world
She said come, come on just spit causally,
Come on, come on and fuck this whole wide world
