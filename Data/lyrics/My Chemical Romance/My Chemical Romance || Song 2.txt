Woo hoo!
Woo hoo!
Woo hoo!
Woo hoo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is
Woo hoo!
When I feel heavy metal
Woo hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you.

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Woo hoo!
When I feel heavy metal
Woo hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
