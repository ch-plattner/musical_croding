Welcome to this institution 
One way to resolution 
I'm put on this medication 
Rolls down my throat 

Cause I can't ever sleep at night the same 
This medication enjoys, enjoys most every day 

Cause I close my eyes, 
I see land 

What did I say? 
What did I say to put Sister to Sleep? 
And fall awake and die 
And I'm never goin' to bed 

Back to the day, back into this day 
Back to another level, hotter then hell
Said that we're not savages until we do it 
Again 
And one last night I'll kiss your lips again 

What did I say? 
What did I say to put Sister to Sleep?
And fall awake and die 
And I'm never goin' to sleep 

I will take this ferris wheel
And I'm sleepwalking back into this hell 

Oh my darling 
For the first time 

Don't let me sleep tonight 
And get in your way tonight 
Don't let me sleep tonight 
Get in your way 

What did I say? 
What did I say to put Sister to sleep? 
I'll never go to sleep 
And I won't go back to bed 

I'm sleepwalking back into this... 
Hell!
Oh... God...
