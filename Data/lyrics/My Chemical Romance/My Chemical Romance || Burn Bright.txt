
So give me all you’ve got,
I can take it
We walked alone in your city lights
Did you make it?
We lit the fire and it’s burning bright

Did you take it?
Kissed all the boys in your city lights
Did you make it?
Left all the stars in your city nights
Can you fake it?
I lost my way in your city lights
Clutching me,
We stole the fire
And it’s burning bright

So give me all you’ve got,
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire
And it’s burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I took the pills
For these empty nights
‘Cause it makes me who I am

They always told me that
“You'll never get to heaven
With a life like yours.
Well, if you’re lost, little boy,
Oh, well, the cameras pull you right back down, yeah.
It’s like a chemical burn,
I'm peeling off your skin, yeah.
And when you see your face,
Well, you'll never be the same again, yeah.”

Cause if you just stop breathing,
I'll stop, I'll stop my heart
I'll stop breathing too

So give me all you’ve got,
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire,
And it’s burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am,
I'd trade the world for your city nights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am

And though I missed the chance for this,
I confess that I can’t wait,
Until it’s gone
No I mean this every single day
So go if you can’t burn inside
‘Cause the world don’t need
Another hopeless cause
Though it makes me who I am
‘Cause it makes me who I am
And you made me who I am
And you made me who I am
Be afraid of what I am

I can take it
We walked around in your city lights,
‘Cause it makes me who I am
I burned it all and I'm doin' fine
‘Cause I’ll never fade away,
If I steal the fire from your city nights
‘Cause it makes me who I am
Who I am
