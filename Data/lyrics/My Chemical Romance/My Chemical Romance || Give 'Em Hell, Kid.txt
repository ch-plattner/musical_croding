
Oh baby here comes the sound!
I took a train outta New Orleans and they shot me full of ephedrine.
This is how we like to do it in the murder scene.
Can we settle up the score?

[Chorus]
If you were here I'd never have a fear.
So go on live your life.
But I miss you more than I did yesterday.

You're beautiful!

Well I'm a total wreck and almost every day.
Like the firing squad or the mess you made.
Well don't I look pretty walking down the street. 
In the best damn dress I own?

[Chorus]
If you were here I'd never have a fear.
So go on live your life.
But I miss you more than I did yesterday.
You're so far away.
So c'mon show me how.
'Cause I mean this more than words can ever say.

Some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say 
We are young and we don't care. (oh whoa ow)
Your dreams and your hopeless hair. (oh whoa ow)
We never wanted it to be this way.
For all our lives.
Do you care {at all}?

[Chorus]
If you were here I'd never have a fear.
So go on live your life.
But I miss you more than I did yesterday.
You're so far away.
So c'mon show me how.
'Cause I mean this more than words can ever say.

(What'd you call me?)
(Well, there's no way I'm kissing that guy)
