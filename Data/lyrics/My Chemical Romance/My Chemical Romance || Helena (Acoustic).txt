
Long ago
Just like the hearse, you die to get in again
We are so far from you

Burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst to take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst thing I can say?
The things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time
When every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very heart you sold

And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst thing I can say?
The things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

And if you carry on this way
The things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend
To leave? And then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide.

What's the worst thing I can say?
The things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

And if you carry on this way
The things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
