
Hear the sound 
The angels come screaming 
Down your voice 
I hear you've been bleeding 

Make your choice 
They say you've been pleading
Someone save us 

Heaven help us now 
Come crashing down 
We'll hear the sound 
As you're falling down 

I'm at this old hotel
But can't tell if I've been breathing or sleeping 
Or screaming or waiting for the man to call 
And maybe all of the above 
Cause mostly I've been sprawled on these cathedral steps 
While spitting out the blood and screaming 
"Someone save us!"

Heaven help us now 
Come crashing down 
We'll hear the sound 
As you're falling down 

And will you pray for me?
Or make a saint of me?
And will you lay for me?
Or make a saint of?

Cause I'll give you all the nails you need 
Cover me in gasoline 
Wipe away those tears of blood again 
And the punchline to the joke is asking
Someone save us 

Heaven help us now 
Come crashing down 
We'll hear the sound 
As you fall

And would you pray for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins
How the misery begins)
Or make a saint of me?
(You don't know
So I'm burning, I'm burning)
And will you lay for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins
How the misery begins)
Or make a saint?
(You don't know
Cause I'm burning, I'm burning)

Cause I'll give you all the nails you need 
(I'm burning, I'm burning again)
Cover me in gasoline again
