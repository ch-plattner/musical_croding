
Oh, you look so tired 
Your mouth is slack and wide 
You're ill-housed and you're,
You're ill-advised 
I bet your face is as mean
As your life has been 

And oh, you look so tired 
Well but tonight you presume too much
Too much, I said too much 
and if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 

Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree 
But you don't refuse 
I know you 

And, oh I, I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 

And oh, you look so tired 
Well but tonight you presume too much
Too much, I said too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 

Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree 
But you don't refuse 
I know you 

Come on!
Let's go! 

And oh, you look so tired 
Well but tonight you presume too much
Too much, I said too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 

Crash into oh my fucking arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree 
But you don't refuse 
I know you
