[In Japanese:
Everyone!
The car has a full tank,
So we're packing the explosives in a suitcase!
Life is short,
And there are many dangers on the roads we travel,
So let's dance!]

Everybody pay attention to me
I got the answer
I got the answer
Street walking cheetah with a capital "G"
So gets your hands up
Now get your hands up

Hide your eyes, we're gonna shine tonight
Sub-atomic never get the best of me
Ain't a DJ gonna save my soul (My soul)
I sold it long ago for rock 'n' roll (Whoa oh)
Drop the needle when the tape deck blows
I gotta shout this out so everybody knows

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends
Well alright

Slide up the faders when the cabinet slams
And get your hands up
Now gets your hands up
Light up the stage and watch me kick out the jams
So throw your fist up
Now throw your fist up

Ain't nobody gonna take my life
Ain't nobody gonna get the best of me
Ain't a preacher gonna save me now
Grab a seat I'm gonna show you how
Everybody hit the pyro cue
We're gonna blow this off
And show you what we do

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends

Well alright [x3]
Oh oh oh oh
Well alright
We came to party
Kill the party tonight
We came to party
Kill the party tonight
Let's go

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
Cause all the good times
Gimme, gimme good times, people, tonight

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You wanna get down
Here comes the encore

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again

So everybody get down
Till the party breaks down
Now everybody get down
Now everybody get down
Till the party breaks down
Tonight
