WHOA!

Don't believe what they say,
We're dead flies in the summertime
They leave us all behind
With duct tape scars on my honey
They don't like who you are
You won't like where we'll go
Brother, protect me now
With blood they wash in the money!

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy!
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy!

Uh UhUh UhUh
Uh UhUh UhUh
Uh UhUh RIGHT NOW

I'm sick down from the bones to the other side
Red-mob, we insects hide
King rat on the streets in another life
They laugh, we don't think it's funny
If what you are
Is just what you own
What have you become
When they take from you
ALMOST EVERYTHING

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy!
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy!

Destroya Destroya Destroya Destroya Destroya Destroya
Against the sun, we're the enemy
Destroya Destroya Destroya DESTROYER

I don't believe in luck (I don't believe in luck)
I don't believe in you (They don't believe in us)
I just believe we're the enemy (but I believe we're the enemy)
I don't believe in God (You don't believe in God)
I don't believe in luck (I don't believe in luck)
I don't believe in you (They don't believe in us)
I just believe we're the enemy (but I believe we're the enemy)

So show me what you got, you children of the gun
Don't hide and we don't run!

Against the sun we're the enemy!
So show me what you got, against the sun we're the enemy!
(Destroya Destroya Destroya DESTROYA)
