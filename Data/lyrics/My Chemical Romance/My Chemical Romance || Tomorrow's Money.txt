Fell in love with a vampire
You wanna get it for free
Then say hello to the brush fire, baby
You gotta take it from me
I’m gonna take it from you
Say hello to the good times
And say hello to the sun
They’re sitting back on an empire
While the world lays back
Puts a kid behind that gun

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning

I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
We got no heroes ‘cause our heroes are dead

Yeah!

Say hello to the program
We’re gonna give it for free
Hook up the veins the antibodies
Got it with the disease
We’re gonna give it to you
Say goodbye to the good times
You’re loading up with the fame
You’re dressing up like a virus
But the words get lost when we all look the same

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning

I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
We got no heroes ‘cause our heroes are dead

Fell in love with a vampire
Tops off? to the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire

Fell in love with a vampire
Tops off? to the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire

Yeah, if we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
While the army wives
Choke down the war with no meaning
I stopped bleeding three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution

Because rebellion ain't a t-shirt you sell
You keep your money and I’ll see you in hell
