
Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal 
And you never had a chance 
Love it, or leave it, you can't understand 
A pretty face, but you do so carry on, 
and on, 
and on 

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me 
I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on, 
and on, 
and on, 
and on 
Love is the red the rose on your coffin door 
What's life like, bleeding on the floor, 
the floor, 
the floor 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

Preach all you want but who's gonna save me? 
I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load 
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent son 
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you run,
and run,
and run,
and run.

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
You wanna follow something 
Give me a better cause to lead 
Just give me what I need 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison (Fire at will)
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts (Fire at will)
And make me ill 
You're running after something (Fire at will)
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want (Fire at will)
Then fire at will
