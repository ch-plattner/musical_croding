
Some people watch
Some people pray
But even lights can fade away.
Some people hope
Some people pay
But why'd we have to stay?
'Cause even heroes
Get the blues
Or any misery you choose
You like to watch
We like to use
And we were born to lose

I choose defeat
I walk away
And leave this place
The same today
Some like to sleep
We like to play
Just look at all that pain

You want the heart
All to be saved
But even good guys
Still get paid
So watch my back
And keep the blade
I think it got you laid

So fake your death
Or it's your blame
And leave the lights on
When you stay
Take off your clothes
And dream that fame
Come on and feel that shame

I choose defeat
I walk away
And leave this place
The same today
Some like to sleep
We like to play
Just look at all that pain

Just look at all that pain [3x]
Just give me all that pain [3x]

I choose defeat
I walk away
And leave this place
The same today
Some like to sleep
We like to play
Just look at all that pain
