
Who wants to do it again?
Cause ya stayed out late tonight
You fought the world it don't seem right
You fought for what you wanna say, too late
Cause I did it all
Every god damn line
I fought the world this time
I fought and lost and what'd I say, today
Cause I did it all.
Give them their coffee and
we'll do it again, do it again, do it again
Hit the bottle tonight, I fought the world this time
I fought and lost just cause I did it again, did it again, did it again
I thought I'd live in hell, I ain't washin' off that smell
You fought for what you wanna say, too late
Cause I did it all, every god damn line
I fought the world this time
I fought and lost and what'd I say, too late
Cause I did it all
Give them their coffee and we'll
do it again, do it again, do it again
Hit the bottle tonight, I fought the world this time
I fought and lost just cause I did it again, did it again, did it again

do it again...
