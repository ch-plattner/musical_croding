Pressure!

Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Bah bah dah bah bah dah
(Yeah) (Yeah)

That's okay!
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Scream "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Bah bah dah bah bah dah
Okay!

Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
Bah bah dah bah bah dah

People on streets
bah dah dee da day
People on streets
bah dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Scream "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow takes me higher (higher)

Yeah!

Turned away from it all
Like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn

Why? Why? Why?
Love (love)! Love (love)! Love (love)!

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?
Give love give love give love give love give love?

Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our ways
Of caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure

Under pressure
Under pressure
