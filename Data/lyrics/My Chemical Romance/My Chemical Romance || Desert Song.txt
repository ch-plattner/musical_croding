We hold in our hearts the sword and the faith 
Swelled up from the rain, clouds move like a wraith 
Well after all, we'll lie another day 
And through it all, we'll find some other way 
To carry on through cartilage and fluid 
And did you come to stare or wash away the blood? 

Well tonight, well tonight 
Will it ever come? 
Spend the rest of your days rocking out 
Just for the dead 
Well tonight 
Will it ever come? 
I can see you awake anytime, in my head 

Did we all fall down? 
Did we all fall down? 
Did we all fall down? 
Did we all fall down? 
From the lights to the pavement 
From the van to the floor 
From backstage to the doctor 
From the Earth to the morgue, morgue, morgue, morgue 

Well tonight 
Will it ever come? 
Spend the rest of your days rocking out 
Just for the dead 
Well tonight 
Will it ever come? 
I can see you awake anytime in my head 

All fall down 
Well after all...
