
Say, the lights are really low enough to play,
Can you catch me when I'm falling down?
And all alone, a moment if
You try to make the most of this,
And could you always love me?
Then you made me walk away.

And would you stay, right here?
When I tell you,
That someone out there loves you
If you stay right here,
When I'd tell you,
That someone out there loves you after all.

Sometimes these things can always be so small,
Sometimes you could hit right back?
Hold me down to catch this vision,
Watch me make the most of this.
And could you make me kiss you?
When we decimate the stars?

And would you stay, right here?
When I tell you,
That someone out there loves you.
If you stay right here,
When I tell you.
That someone out there loves you

If there is no one, no one out there?
Is there no one, no one who cares?
If there is no one, no one out there?
Is there no one, like you to share?
Would you ask yourself?
Would you ask yourself?

Stay.
And would you stay, right here?
When I tell you,
That someone out there loves you.
If you stay right here, stay right here.
Stay with me, stay right here, stay right here.
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me.
Stay, stay, stay.
Stay.
