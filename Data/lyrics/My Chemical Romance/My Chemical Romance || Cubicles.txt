It's the tearing sound of love-notes
Drowning out these gray stained windows
And the view outside is sterile
And I'm only two cubes down
I'd photocopy all the things that we could be
If you took the time to notice me
But you can't now, I don't blame you
And it's not your fault that no one ever does

[Chorus:]
But you don't work here anymore
It's just a vacant three by four
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face
This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition and it's terminal
In this water-cooler romance
And it's coming to a close
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree
Kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view
And pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall

[Chorus]

I know you don't work here anymore [x6]

Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, live and breathe and die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, I'd think I'd love to die alone

Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down
I think I'd love to die
Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down
I think I'd love to die alone [x4]
Live and breathe and die alone
I think I'd love to die alone [x2]

I think I'd love to die alone
