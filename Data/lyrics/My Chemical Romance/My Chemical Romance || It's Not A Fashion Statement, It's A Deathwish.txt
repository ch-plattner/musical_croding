
For what you did to me,
and what I'll do to you,
you get, what everyone else gets,
you get a lifetime

Let's go! 

Do you remember that day when we met 
you told me this gets harder 
well it did
been holding on forever,
promise me that when I'm gone you'll kill my enemies,
the damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

We never got that far,
this helps me to think all through the night
bright lights that won't kill me now, or tell me how 
just you and I, your starless eyes remain.

Hip Hip Hooray for me, you talk to me, but would you kill me in my sleep 
lay still like the dead
from the razor to the rosary
we could lose ourselves
and paint these walls in pitchfork red

I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

This hole you put me in 
wasn't deep enough 
and I'm climbing out right now 
you're running out of places to hide from me 
when you go
just know that I will remember you
if living was the hardest part
we'll then one day be together
and in the end we'll fall apart
just like the leaves change in colors
and then I will be with you 
I will be there one last time now

when you go
just know that I will remember you

I lost my fear of falling
I will be with you
I will be with you
