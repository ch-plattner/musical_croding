[Voice recording rewinds and plays certain parts, speeds up and slows down:]
"...Like last night, they are not like tremors, they are worse than tremors,
they are these terrors. And it's like, it feels like as if somebody
was gripping my throat and squeezing and..."

Some say, now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior,
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions.
Don't you breathe for me,
Undeserving of your sympathy,
Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did.

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
Cause I don't feel bad about it.
So shut your eyes,
Kiss me goodbye,
And sleep.
Just sleep.

The hardest part is letting go of your dreams.

A drink for the horror that I'm in,
For the good guys, and the bad guys,
For the monsters that I've been.
Three cheers for tyranny,
Unapologetic apathy,
Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again.

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
Cause I don't feel bad about it.
So shut your eyes, 
Kiss me goodbye,
And sleep.
Just sleep.

The hardest part's the awful things that I've seen.

[Voice recording:]
"...Sometimes I see flames. And sometimes 
I see people that I love dying and... it's always..."

Just sleep.
Just sleep.
Just sleep.
Just sleep.
Just sleep.
Just sleep.

[Screaming:] Wake up!

[Voice recording:]
"And I can't... I can't ever wake up."
