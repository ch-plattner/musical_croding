Give up or give it a shot
Dedication, to the places that you never need to hide
Occupations, the opportunity to see yourself in a light

And all the city fires
And the tabloid lies
And the television guys
For the missions and the boulevards
And the way it is when money's all you got

Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don’t dare to sing another song for California

Well, anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don’t care or need another song for California

Shut up and give me a shot
On vacation, to the places that you never want to die
On the station, everybody hears but no one needs to try
On the telephone, on the methane dare
Every minute that you scream

Before the errant scars and the dying stars
Every second that you take to fake your life

Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don’t dare to sing another song for California

Well, anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don’t care or need another song for California

Stop and stare
At the accidents and stars that bore you
We don’t dare to sing another song for California

Well, anywhere
Where the city lights are hopeless for you
We don’t care or need another song for California
