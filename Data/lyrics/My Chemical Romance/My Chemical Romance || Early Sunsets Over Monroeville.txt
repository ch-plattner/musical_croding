
Late dawns and early sunsets, just like my favorite scenes
Then holding hands and life was perfect, just like up on the screen
And the whole time while always giving
Counting your face among the living

Up and down escalators, pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half price sales, trapped in by all these mountains
Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me here
Not knowing you'd change from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

But does anyone notice? 
But does anyone care? 
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...
But would anything matter if you're already dead? 
And well should I be shocked now by the last thing you said? 
Before I pull this trigger, 
Your eyes vacant and stained...

But does anyone notice? 
But does anyone care? 
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...
And would anything matter if you're already dead? 
And now should I be shocked by the last thing you said? 
Before I pull this trigger, 
Your eyes vacant and stained...
And in saying you loved me,
Made things harder at best,
And these words changing nothing
As your body remains,
And there's no room in this hell,
There's no room in the next,
And our memories defeat us,
And I'll end this direst.

But does anyone notice? 
But does anyone care? 
And if I had the guts to put this to your head...
But does anything matter if you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger,
Your eyes vacant and stained...
And in saying you loved me,
Made things harder at best,
And these words changing nothing
As your body remains,
And there's no room in this hell, 
There's no room in the next,
But does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed?
