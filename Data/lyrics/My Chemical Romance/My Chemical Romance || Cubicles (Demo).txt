
It's the tearing sound of love notes
Drowning out these gray stained windows
And the view outside is sterile
And I'm only two cubes down

I'd photocopy all the things that we could be
If you took the time to notice me
But you can't now, I don't blame you
And it's not your fault that no one ever does

But you don't work here any more
It's just a vacant three by four
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face

This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition, and it's terminal
In this water-cooler romance
And it's coming to a close

We could be in the park and dancing by a tree
Kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view
And pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall

But you don't work here any more
It's just a vacant three by four
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face

This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

I know you don't work here any more
I know you don't work here any more
I know you don't work here any more
I know you don't work here any more
I know you don't work here any more, any more
I know you don't work here any more, any more

Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Live and breathe and die alone

Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone
I'd think I'd love to die aâ€¦

Just (just), take (take)
I think I'd love to die
Me (me), down (down)
I think I'd love to die
Just (just), take (take)
I think I'd love to die
Me (me), down (down)

I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
Live and breathe and die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone

I think I'd love to die alone...
