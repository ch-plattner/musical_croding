Every snowflake's different just like you
(Every snowflake's different just like you)

I'll sing about it if you ask me to
(Ask me to)

Different shape and different size
Like every star up in the sky
Every snowflake's different just like you

Green fur
Blue skin
And the very silly way you grin

Big fangs
Small chin
There are so many special things about you
Things about you
Things about you

Every snowflake's different just like
Every snowflake's different just like
Every snowflake's different just like you

Different shape and different size
Like every star up in the sky
Every snowflake's different just like you
