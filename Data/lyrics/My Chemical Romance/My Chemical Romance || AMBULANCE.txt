You don’t know a thing about this life
And we are up for everything it takes to prove we’re not the same as them
And we will wear our masks again out after dark
‘Cause we are up for everything it takes and we are not the same

‘Cause we are not afraid
And we are not ashamed

And if you save my life
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
And if I ever let you down
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight

Remember, once you walked this kind of life
Quietly I’ll sleep behind the wheel
And passing every face you see the first time
Singing every piece as you walk by
Proving that with all of my mistakes
That we are not the same

‘Cause we are not the same
And we are all to blame

And if you save my life
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
And if they ever let you down
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
You home tonight

It's driving you down
It's driving you down
It's driving you down
It's driving you down
It's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
It's driving you, driving you down

You don’t know a thing about this life
And you don’t know a thing about this life
And you don’t know a thing about this life
‘Cause you don’t know a thing about me
You don’t know a thing

And if you save my life
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
If they ever let you down
I’ll be the one who drives you home tonight
You home tonight
Well you home tonight

'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you, driving you, driving you down
