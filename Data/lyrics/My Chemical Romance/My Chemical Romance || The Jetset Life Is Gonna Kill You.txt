
Gaze into her killing jar 
I'd sometimes stare for hours (sometimes stare for hours).
She even poked the holes so I can breathe.
She bought the last line.
I'm just the worst kind.
Of guy to argue.
With what you might find.
And for the last night I lie.
Could I lie with you?

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living.
Alright, she wants
It all to come down this time.

Lost in the prescription 
she's got something else in mind (something else in mind).
Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte.
It gives the weak flight.
It gives the blind sight.
Until the cops come.
Or by the last light.
And for the last night I lie.
Could I lie next to you?

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living.
Alright, she wants
It all to come down this time.

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living.
Alright, she wants
It all to come down this time.

Pull the plug.
But I'd like to learn your name.
And holding on.
Well I hope you do the same.
Aw sugar.
Slip into the tragedy you've spun this chamber dry.

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living.
Alright, she wants
It all to come down this time.
