
Make room! Make room!
Down on the coffin there's a coffin or two,
Dead chic, so cool,
The cannibals are starving when they're looking at you.

Tank tops, jet stream,
Karate lessons with a killing machine.
White lines, nose bleeds,
I know you get exited when the cameras go
(Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)

Me and you and all of this living dead
Burning up in the sun where the bodies add
Sitting here with you in misery
Anybody gonna come and rescue me?
La la la 

Alright
Whoah!

Make room! Make room!
One day you'll gonna have explaining to do.
Drag star, so cool,
There's only room for one man and the one is you, you, you

Me and you and all of these living dead,
Burning up in the sun where the bodies add
Got a taste for cash and androgyny
Anybody wanna come and rescue me?!

Alright, oh oh oh oh
Well alright [x7]
She's alright
Everybody in the room is alright

Everybody wants to change the world!
Everybody wants to change the world!
But no one, no one wants to die!
[x3]

We are never gonna change the world!
We are never gonna change the world!
'Cause we are never gonna DIE!

Everybody wants to change the world!
Everybody wants to change the world!
But no one, no one wants to die!
[x4]

MAKE ROOM!!!!
