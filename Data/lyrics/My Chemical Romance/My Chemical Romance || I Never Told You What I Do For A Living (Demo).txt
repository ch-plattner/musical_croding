Far from this return
I fall out of grace
I live my whole life motherfucker babe
By this everyday
You can't take this life
Take it back from me
I live my whole life baby
I live this everyday

You see your life in my hands
Your love is covered in blood
and piss, clean me off
I'm so dirty babe
You know the money and it ain't for the taunt where do you go
You feel the hurt in my head
Let's go

And go so far
And we'll bury them
In a hole so deep

Life from this return
I fall out of grace
I live my whole life motherfucker babe
By this everyday
I see your life in my hands
And now it's covered in blood
and piss, clean me off
I'm so dirty babe

It ain't for money, baby
Baby, I just do it for fame
It's for the glory, baby
When this ends

And go so far
And we'll bury them
So hard and deep we'll go through

I tried, well
I tried, well

And we'll all dance along to the tune of your death
And we'll laugh again, we'll cry again
And it's better off this way

And never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now

Well never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now

I tried
One more night, well...
I tried
I tried
Well, I tried
I tried!
I tried!
I tried!
Well...

And we'll love again, 
we'll laugh again
We'll cry again 
and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way
It's so much better off this way
And I'm trying to see that you wanted to die

And never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
