
In the middle of a gun fight... 
In the center of a restaurant... 
They say, "Come with your arms raised high!" 
Well, they're never gonna get me, 
Like a bullet through a flock of doves... 
To wage this war against your faith in me, 
Your life...will never be the same. 
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer...say a prayer! 

[Chorus] 
Now, but I can't 
And I don't know 
How we're just two men as God had made us, 
Well, I can't...well, I can! 
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this 
Pain in my heart for your dying wish, 
I'll kiss your lips again. 

They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost, 
My cellmate's a killer, they make me do push-ups (in drag) 
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...am I losing myself?! 
Well, I miss my mom, 
Will they give me the chair, 
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare; 
Ah, nobody knows...all the trouble I've seen! 

[Chorus] 

To your room... 
What they ask of you 
Will make you want to say, "So long..." 
Well, I don't remember, 
Why remember...YOU?! 

Do you have the keys to the hotel?! 
'Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! (FIRE!!)

Life is but a dream for the dead, 
And well I, I won't go down by myself, 
But I'll go down with my friends. 
Now now now now... (I can't explain)
Now now now... (I can't complain)
Now now, yeah!
