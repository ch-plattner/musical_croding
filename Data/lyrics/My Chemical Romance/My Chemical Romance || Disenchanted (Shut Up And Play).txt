
Another sad song, with nothing to say 
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
If you believe that I'm wrong 
This never meant nothing to you
I waited so long for someone to say
If you can move on
I'll never get you to stay 
If you believe that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
Another sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long, wait for a hospital stay
If you believe that I'm wrong 
This never meant nothing to you

And if you hold on
And need me to stay
You get the hard thoughts
Oh baby just the mistakes 
Maybe we'll just
Shut up and play
It never did mean nothing to you
Never did mean...

Another sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long, wait for a hospital stay
If you believe that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

If you would hold on
And need me to stay
You get the hard thoughts
Oh baby just the mistakes 
We never really got too much anyways
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just go

Just go, run away
Where did you run
Don't fight it just run away
Let it go...
And when you go, run don't walk
And when you sing, scream don't talk

Another sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long
Wait for a hospital stay
We never really got too much anyways

Another sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long, wait for a hospital stay
Maybe we'll just shut up and play.
You never really got it
No you never really got it at all
