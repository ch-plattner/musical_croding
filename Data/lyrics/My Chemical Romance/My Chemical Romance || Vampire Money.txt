1-2-3-4
3-2-1 We came to fuck
Everybody party till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea till it's done

Hair Back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you, c'mon

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon!)
Play the game and take the band real far (c'mon!)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon!)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon!

Hey you look like somebody I used to know

And now 3-2-1 we got the bomb
Everybody hurry till the taxman comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the morning sun
And get your finger on the trigger
Tap the barrel of the a gun

Hair back, motherfucker!
Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you (c'mon!)

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon!)
Play the game and take the band real far (c'mon!)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon!)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon!

Fuck yeah
That's right
1-2-3-4

Well 3-2-1 we came to fuck
Everybody party till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea till it's done

Hair Back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you (c'mon!)

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon!)
Play the game and take the band real far (c'mon!)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon!)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
On
On
On
On!

This party
I think it's way too loud
Gonna have to turn it down a little, sorry
