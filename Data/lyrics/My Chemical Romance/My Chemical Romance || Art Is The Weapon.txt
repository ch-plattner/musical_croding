109 in the sky but the pigs wont quit
You're here with me
Dr. DeathDefying
I'll be you surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter
Pumpin' up the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you live
A system failure for the masses
Anti-matter for the master plan
Louder than god's revolver and twice as shiny
This ones for all you rock and rollers
All you crash queens and motor babies
Listen up!
The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now, and do it loud
Killyjoys, make some noise

NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA NANANANANANA
NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA NANANANANANA
NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA NA

NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA
For My Security (NA-NA-NANANA)
(NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA)
To to every enemy (NA-NA-NANANA)
(NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA)
We're on their property (NA-NA-NANANA)
Standing in V formation

NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA NA-NA-NA NA

NA NANANA NANANA
Drop like a bullet shell (NA-NA-NANANA)
NA NANANA NANANA
Just like a sleeper cell (NA-NA-NANANA)
NA NANANA NANANA
Id rather go to hell (NA-NA-NANANA)
Then be in a purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me
Pull this pin
Let this world explode
