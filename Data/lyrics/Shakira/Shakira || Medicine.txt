And I feel like I'm losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing 'cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make a war seem like such an easy game
Kiss me and my arguments come undone
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole
You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No you won't see me popping the pills
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole
You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole

You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole
You make it all better, better
You make me feel whole

You're my medicine
