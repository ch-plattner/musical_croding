
Once upon a time you and I
When we were dreamin' easy
Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky
There was nothing we could sell or buy
'Cause all we really needed
Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly

What do you think, darling?
Have we lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt melancholy, darling
Wishing that time hadn't passed?

Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears
And our dreams for plans?

Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared?
And when love was on our side
On our side...

I remember all the times before
When we could spend our living
Staring at the ceiling, lying on the floor
My vocabulary wasn't broad
I spoke so little English
And the words transferred
Sound like something odd

What do you think, darling?
Have I lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt the melancholy, darling
Wishing that time hadn't passed?

Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears
And our dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared?
And when love was on our side
On our side...

What is your guess, darling?
Have I lived too much, too fast?
So if you
If you ever come and find me crying
Now you know
Now you know why

Can you tell me how I used to be?
Have I missed my chance?
Have I changed my hopes for fears
And my dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared?
And when love was on our side
On our side...
