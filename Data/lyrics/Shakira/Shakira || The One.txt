
So I find a reason to shave my legs 
Each single morning 
So I count on someone on 
Friday nights to take me dancing
And then to church on Sundays 
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids 
Or maybe just to save a little money

[Chorus:]
You're the one I need 
The way back home is always long 
But if you're close to me I'm holding on 
You're the one I need 
My real life has just begun 
Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun 

In the world full of strangers 
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook 
and finally lose my kitchen phobia 
So I've got the arms to cuddle in 
When there's a ghost or a muse 
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs 
And write more happy songs 
It always takes a little help from someone

[Chorus 2X]

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 
With you my real life has just begun

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

Nothing like your smile made of sun 

Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
