If you do not mean them
Why do you fill up my wounds
With your dirt

Bullets of fire
This time I can't shield them
Santa Maria, I know how it hurts

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

Why do you make me believe we are spirits
Molded together to conquer this Earth
Climb up the mountains so high we can see them
Then send me to plummet with savaging words

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

I am covered in scars
Like a rose without thorns
My defenses are gone
No one's out there to warn
If there's love in your heart
Let me leave now in peace
You know you took it too far

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so, so
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so
