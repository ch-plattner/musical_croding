Tell me lies
slap me on the face
just improvise
do something
really clever
that'll make me hate
your name forever

You might swear
you'd never
touch a lady
well, let me say
you're not too far
from maybe
every day you find
new ways to hurt me

But I can't help it
if I'm just a fool
always having my heart
set on you
'til the time
you start changing
the rules
I'll keep chasing
the soles
of your shoes

Fool

God resigned from
hearing my old story
every night I'm paying
hell for glory
I'm embarrassed but
I'm much more sorry

All this pain begins
to feel like pleasure
with more tears
you'd make a sea
a desert
salt my wounds
and i'll keep
saying thank you

But I can't help it
if I'm just a fool
always having my heart
set on you
'til the time
you start changing
the rules
I'll keep chasing
the soles
of your shoes

Fool

But I can't help it
if I'm just a fool
always having my heart
set on you
'til the time
you start changing
the rules
I'll keep chasing
the soles
of your shoes

Fool
I can't help it baby
fool
I can't help it baby
fool
I can't help it baby
fool
I can't help it baby

Fool
I'm a fool
I'm a fool
