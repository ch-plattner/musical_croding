
Sunrise blinded by the morning light
Already dreaming up tonight
And I know
That it won't be long
Oh, we can't hide
From the love that burns this strong

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love

Night time
And I am back in your arms
When all my dreams are brought to life
And I know that it won't be long
For we can't hide
From the love that burns this strong

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
