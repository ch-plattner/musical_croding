Every morning when I woke up
I was choked up
I was living without a purpose
Always jumping all the hurdles
Doing circles
In the dark with a broken compass

I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that much is clear
But I made it here, my love
Yeah I made it here, my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you are the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

Every morning when you wake up
I wanna hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that
You just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

I can't explain the way it feels
I could choke on my own words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
But you're really here, my love
Yeah, you're really here, my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you are the one thing that I got right

Every time I see your smile
Every time I hear your laugh
Baby you bring a new sunshine over my way
You are that little dream
I had since I was a child
My fairy tale comes true when I look at your face
I may not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you are the one thing that I got right
You are the one thing that I got right

And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you are the one thing that I got right
You are the one thing that I got right

One thing that I got right
One thing that I got right
