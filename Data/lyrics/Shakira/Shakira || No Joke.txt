I'll never die
And you know that it's no Joke
Woo oooh
I'll let you know
And in that you'll never know
Woo oooh

And it hurts and I cry
And you're leaving with my heart
I can live but you know
I'll obey the original
I got to know the creation
I got a single question

Believe in love
Don't you know that is no joke
Ooooh
I've got to learn
But you know that is no joke
Oooh

I, I, I, I

I'll never die
And you know that it's no joke
Woo oooh
I'll let you know
And in that you'll never know
Woo oooh

Mend my heart I can live
But you never let you go
I'll go look all over
But you never let me know
I got the love connection
You got a single question

Believe in love
Don't you know that is no joke
Ooooh
I've got to learn
But you know that is no joke
Oooh

I, I, I, I

Don't you know
I'm alright
I could never let you go,
I'm alright
Its not my fault
you know it
eeehh,
I got to see you Honey

Believe in love
but you know that is no joke,
I've got to learn,
but you know that its no joke [x2]

Oooh

You can't run, you can't hide
