
Put your trust in me 
I won't let you down 
Don't delay the things 
That you want right now 

Why wait for later? 
Hey I don't you want some action 
I'm not a waiterI like to make things happen 

Something's coming on, coming on strong 
Don't take too long 
Don't you wanna know 
Baby come home 

[Chorus:]
One more night with you 
I won't think it through 
Time's money but you knew 
There's nothing in the world you can think of that I won't do to you. 

Drowning in your sweat 
Till I drench my clothes 
You've seen nothing yet 
Wait till you let go. 

Why wait for later? 
Obey my intuition 
We're gonna be just fine 
I've got a premonition 

Something's coming on, coming on strong 
Don't take too long 
Don't you wanna know 
Baby come home 

[Chorus:]
One more night with you 
I won't think it through 
Time's money but you knew 
There's nothing in the world you can think of that I won't do to you. 

I'm gonna dance through the veil of your eyes 
While you follow my steps in the sand 
I see your fate in the palm of your hand. 

No one looks, no one hears us this time 
It's only me and your conscious tonight 
If there are no witnesses, there is no crime. 

Why wait for later? 
I'm not a waiter. 

Something's coming on, coming on strong 
Don't take too long 
Don't you wanna know 
Baby come home. 

[Chorus:]
One more night with you 
I won't think it through 
Time's money but you knew 
There's nothing in the world you can think of that I won't do to you. 

[Chorus:]
One more night with you 
I won't think it through 
Time's money but you knew 
There's nothing in the world you can think of that I won't do to you.
