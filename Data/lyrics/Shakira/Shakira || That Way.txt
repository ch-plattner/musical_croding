
I've got my baggage
And you've got yours
I know we've been damaged
Been through it all

And you know that feeling
Just before a beautiful disaster
Right on the top
Looking down from the terrifying
Rolling roller coaster

Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
My broken heart's beating faster now
In your arms
But I know that I'm safe here in your arms

Lay down
Lay down your head on my shoulder
Hey now
Let's just depart from the notion
That I love you too much
And I'm here to stay
I'm not giving up
I'm not running away
So we're going to leave it that way
That way

This is much bigger than you and I
To live without love would be suicide
I think you'll would soon close your pretty eyes
I like you hear your breathing
It's like the soundtrack of your life
The only memory I'm keeping

Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
Your broken heart is beating faster now
In my arms
I promise that you're safe here in my arms

Lay down
Lay down your head on my shoulder
Hey now
Let's just depart from the notion
That I love you too much
And I'm here to stay
I'm not giving up
I'm not running away
So we're going to leave it that way
We're going to leave it that way
That way
