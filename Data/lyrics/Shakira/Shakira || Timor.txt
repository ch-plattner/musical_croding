Yale, Yale
East Timor, Timor
Timor, Timor
Timor, Timor

Going on and on and on and on
This is going on and on and on and on now
Said it once and say it twice
I want to save your time
Safety, safety

It's alright, it's alright
'Cause the system never fails
The good guys are in power
And the bad guys are in jail

It's alright, it's alright
Just as long as we can vote
We live in democracy
And that's what we promote

Isn't it? Isn't it?
Oh...
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Oh...

It's alright, it's alright
If the news says half the truth
Hearing what we want's
The secret of eternal youth

It's alright, it's alright,
If the planet splits in three
'Cause I'll keep on selling records
And you've got your MTV

If we forget about 'em
Don't worry
If they forget about us
Then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?

East Timor
Timor, Timor
Ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It's alright, it's alright
They don't show it all on TV
So we won't really know it
Just by watching *BC

It's alright, it's alright
For our flag we die or kill
As long as we don't know it
We'd do it just to pay the bills

If we forget about 'em
Don't worry
If they forget about us
Then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?

If we forget about 'em
Don't worry
If they forget about us
Then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?

East Timor
Timor, Timor

Let's keep tanning while it's sunny
They'll risk our hides to make their money
Now don't you find that funny?

If we forget about 'em
If they forget about us
Then hurry
How about those people who don't matter anymore?

If we forget about 'em
Don't worry
If they forget about us
Then hurry
How about those people who don't matter anymore?

East Timor
Timor, Timor

East Timor
Timor, Timor
