
Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire

Before I met you I wasn't terribly lucky
Every Prince Charming lost charm after twelve
But then you came and made the past look so funny
Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf

If this was meant to be
Don't condemn me to be free
And even if we never marry
I will always love you, baby
Childishly

'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists

And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists
You make me believe
You make me believe

I love the temperature and smell of your body
The shape of your lips and the size of your nose
I love that everything you say is so funny
Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known

You see the way I am
Without make-up, without clothes
And you accept me like nobody
And I will always love you, baby
With eyes closed

'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists

And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists
You make me believe
You make me believe

Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire

There's something
I believe...

There's something
I believe...

There's something
I believe
I do

You make me believe...

... Je te desire ...
