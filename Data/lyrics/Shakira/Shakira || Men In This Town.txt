
Is there a prince in this fable 
For a small town girl like me? 
The good ones are gone or not able... 
and Matt Damon's not meant for me 
Damon's not meant for me (Damnit!) 

I got to say 
California 

Is a place that I respect 

Come on LA, take advantage 
Give me a night that I won't forget 

I went to look 
From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took 
These boys don't care 
Got a handful with their projects and with their looks 

[Chorus:]
Where are all the men in this town? 
And what's a girl supposed to do? 
Did they all run off when they knew 
That I was coming round, coming round? 

Where are all the men in this town? 
And what's a girl supposed to do? 
Did they all run off when they knew 
That I was coming round, coming round? 

Fresh 
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean 
Got the lips and got the skin 
Got the skin got that thing 
I'm so fresh and I'm so... 

Is there a prince in this fable 
For a small town girl like me? 
The good ones are gone or not able... 
and Matt Damon's not meant for me (Damnit again!) 

I never dreamed that I'd come here to become the next Jolie 
But I sure know there's someone, around somewhere who's meant to be 

[Chorus:]
Where are all the men in this town? 
And what's a girl supposed to do? 
Did they all run off when they knew 
That I was coming round, coming round? 

Where are all the men in this town? 
And what's a girl supposed to do? 
Did they all run off when they knew 
That I was coming round, coming round? 

Fresh 
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean 
Got the lips and got the skin 
Got the skin got that thing 
I'm so fresh and I'm so... 

Fresh 
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean 
Got the lips and got the skin 
Got the skin got that thing 
I'm so fresh and I'm so... 

So they say 
It's a suicide, waiting, others say 
It's a suicide, waiting, yo no se 
It's a suicide, waiting, another day 
It's a suicide, waiting 

So decide, it's a suicide waiting, all this time 
It's a suicide, waiting, donde estas? 
It's a suicide, waiting, so decide 
It's a suicide, waiting
