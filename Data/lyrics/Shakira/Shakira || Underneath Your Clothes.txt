
You're a song 
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong cause 
This might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

Because of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over 
We will still belong to each other 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey [x2]

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true 
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey [x2]
