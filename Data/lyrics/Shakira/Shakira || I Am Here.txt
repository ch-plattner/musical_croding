I don’t know what to say
Everything is wrong
I can’t believe that I was so blind
Once again I lost my way
I know that you’re gone
All I want is what I strived

I know I hurt you deep inside
Maybe you can’t forget the lies

But I can’t hide my tears
I don’t wanna lose you
I know that in my heart
You still feel the same way too

I said so many things before
Never stopped to think
So please to try to undestand.

I know I hurt you deep inside
(I know I hurt you deep inside)
Maybe you can’t forget the lies

[Chorus:]
So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinnin’ round like
I just made the bridges fall

I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall

I don’t wanna cry anymore

The letters that I wrote
I could never send
I was just a fool, you see
I know you trusted me
I was just so weak
No I’m guilty for your pain

I know I hurt you deep inside.
(I know I hurt you deep inside)
Maybe you can’t forget the lies

[Chorus:]
So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinnin’ round like
I just made the bridges fall

I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall

So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinnin’ round like
I just made the bridges fall

I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall

If you want me back in your life
I should be here if you wanna try
Yeah

[Chorus:]
So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinnin’ round like
I just made the bridges fall

I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall
