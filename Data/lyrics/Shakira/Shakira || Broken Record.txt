I'm older but you're wiser
That anyone can see
You're patient like no other
Has ever been with me
Your eyes take me to places
I've never dreamt about
Your voice is the only music I can't do without

There can't be any doubts now
We are just too far ahead to look behind
And above the good and bad

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking... my search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking ... you are the one

Your hands that have no mercy
Are also my best friends
And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
I found the perfect distance between my body and you
And that is, no distance dear if that's all right with you
They said we wouldn't make it
But look at how we've beaten all the odds
I just need you
To be aware of that...

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking... my search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking ... you are the one

I just want you to take a leap of faith
I know it's easy to make all the same mistakes
But I won't this time, no not this time

I need you to believe in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking...
You are the one

A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
Remember the first Christmas
It almost seemed untrue
You promised that
You'd always be with me and I promised too
