
I think you are living in denial 
Oh can't you see she's pretty wild? 
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up 
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child 

They say "l'amour est ne a Paris" 
So she's planned a little trip to France 
while she's in anxious anticipation 
I really hope you have a horrible vacation 

And so you think of me when you arrive. 
Hope the french fleas eat you both alive. 
And your room smells 
And the toilet doesn't flush 
And locals treat you mean 
And the service takes too long 

'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two 
But you just smile 
Like it's all the same to you, to you 

[Chorus:]
But when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

And when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

Where did you get the ability? 
To make fakes promises to me 
You are exactly like 
a politician 
Need everyone's approval just to see if you are doing right. 

And I hope you both freeze under the Eiffel Tower 
So you end up throwing in the towel 

Hope you'll miss me 
And someday you're gonna see 
That I put my trust in you 
But you turned you back to me. 

'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two 
But you just smile 
Like it's all the same to you, to you 

[Chorus:]
But when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

And when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

[Chorus:]
But when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

And when you learn your lesson 
Come like a prodigal son 
Read the big sign at the airport 
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour 

Mon amour, mon amour...
