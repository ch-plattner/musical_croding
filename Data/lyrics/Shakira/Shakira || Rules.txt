You have to swear
You've got love to love me
That will last forever
We must have a story
With a happy ending
?I swear to never go away?
And never put aside
The things I'm gonna say
Cuz these are rules for us

[Chorus:]

Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh at me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Can't you see
You always were
You'll always be

You used to say
I should see a doctor
Who would keep me busy
Cuz a jealous woman
Never makes it easy
And you know I'll defrost
Whatever seems right
But it may take a while
Before I change the rules

[Chorus (2X)]
