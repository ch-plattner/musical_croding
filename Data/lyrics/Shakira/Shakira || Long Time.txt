
Hold me 
Show me all the talent God has given you 
I want us thinking outside the box (all night long) 
Just keep on going 

You've done good things for me 
Though I'm not an easy girl to please 
I'll never run out of faith in you (all night long) 
Just keep on going 

[Chorus:]
Long time long time 
That's the way I've loved you baby 
Long night it's been a long night 
I'm breaking the record, told ya 

Long time long time 
The minutes are eternal lately 
Long night it's been a long night 
Can't wait to touch you, touch you 

I wish I had longer legs 
That I could fasten to your body so you'd take me with you everywhere 
And when you think I can take no more (all night long) 
Just keep on going 

If I let you have your way don't think I'm weak 
You got the stamina and the technique 
So let those eloquent hands of yours (all night long) 
Just keep on going 

[Chorus:]
Long time long time 
That's the way I've loved you baby 
Long night it's been a long night 
I'm breaking the record, told ya 

Long time long time 
The minutes are eternal lately 
Long night it's been a long night 
Can't wait to touch you, touch you 

This thing we've got's so rare 
It's so good it's not even fair 
So how could anything compare 
To your way, no way 

How can you do me so much good 
I'm so happy I should get sued 
But nothing matters next to you 
No way, no way 

[Chorus:]
Long time long time 
That's the way I've loved you baby 
Long night it's been a long night 
I'm breaking the record, told ya 

Long time long time 

The minutes are eternal lately 
Long night it's been a long night 
Can't wait to touch you, touch you
