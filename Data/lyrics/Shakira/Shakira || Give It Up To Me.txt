Timb, are you on it?
Timb, are you on it?
Give me some
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted? Oh

Uh, Wayne's world
I'm the cashier I change girls
You can go up my crane girl
And I'mma go down that drain girl

Hey ah midnight cowboy
My flow's a dog, down boy
Hah, my girl is a queen
And she do what I say and I say what I mean

Then I give it to her uncut
Shakira, swing those hips like nun chucks
Now, give it to me
I want the best and the best things in life are free

You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

What you get is exactly what you give
Never really know until you try
We're so ahead of this

Got this she wolf appetite
That keeps me up all night
You know the way it works
Don't be afraid to ask

Aim high when the target is low
FYI, I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this

What you give is exactly what you receive
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I'll play the games that you want me to play

You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your mind, in your life
Give it up to me

Hey can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your life, in your life
Give it up to me

Hey lil' lady
What's your plan?
Say lil' mama
Come take a ride jump in

Hey there, baby
What's on your mind?
Don't need approval tonight, tonight
Give it up

You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me

Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
Give it up to me
