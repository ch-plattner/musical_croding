Oh, you know I have seen
A sky without sun
A man with no nation
Saints, captive in chains
A song with no name
For lack of imagination 
Ya he...
And I have seen
Darker than ebony

Ya he Ya he Ya la he

And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Oh, You know I seen
A woman of means
In rags and begging for pleasure
Crossed a river of salt
Just after I rode
A ship that's sunk in the desert

Ya he Ya he Ya la he

And I have seen
Darker than ebony

Ya he Ya he Ya la he

And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

rabboussamai fikarrajaii 
fi ainaiha aralhayati 
ati ilaika min haza lkaaouni 
arjouka labbi labbi nidai 

Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
