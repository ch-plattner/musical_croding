BamboooOOOooo

Perfection, Perfection

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama (SI) bonita (SI)
Mi casa (SHAKIRA SHAKIRA) su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right

Ay ay ay to the bamboooo
La gloria te esta esperando

Latino! Africano! Asiatico! Americano!
Tu Dios te esta mirando!

BamboooOOOooo
Tembaleuoluwaaluweee
Anubaleee le balooo
Levanlevaaandaa laoooo

No Fighting tonight!

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama (SI) bonita (SI)
Mi casa (SHAKIRA SHAKIRA) su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy

Ay ay ay to the bamboooo
La gloria te esta esperando

I know I'm on tonight
So my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right

Come on let's go, let's go
Tu Dios te esta mirando!

Baila en la calle de noche...
Baila en la calle de dia...
Baila en la calle de noche...
Juega en la calle de dia...

People in the front, DON'T FIGHT TONIGHT!
People in the side, DON'T FIGHT TONIGHT!
People in the back, DON'T FIGHT TONIGHT!
Don't fight tonight!
Don't fight tonight!

Let's go...
I'm a student of Pele, call me Pele player.
Eleven on the field with the heart of a gladiator

One GOAL
Two GOAL
Three GOAL
GOAL!

Imma play till my knees grow low

One GOAL
Two GOAL
Three GOAL
GOAL!

Everybody in the FIFA in the final state go
And my football jersey says Maradonna
And the crowd chants, sounds like spirits from Africa

BamboooOOOooo
Tembaleuoluwaaluweee
Anubaleee le balooo
Levanlevaaandaa laoooo

BamboooOOOooo
Tembaleuoluwaaluweee
Anubaleee le balooo
Levanlevaaandaa laoooo
