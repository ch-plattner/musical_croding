
First Floor (ah..)
Room Sixteen (ah..)
Smells like danger (let's go)
Even better (let's go)
Set your goals (ah..)
Bless our souls (ah..)
I'm in trouble (yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven

HEY!

You were like one of those guys
The kind with a wandering eyes (HEY!)
But I said, "hey what the hell, once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side"
You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute, as well (HEY!)
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that

Did it again, now
I got it all wrong
But it felt so right
I can't believe it

And all the mistakes
That went on for too long
Wish there was a way
I could delete it

Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Second night in a row
Back in trouble
I don't get it
Gotta keep it down
'Cause the lobby called
We ignore it (yes, I know)
Getting better

Hey!

When it comes to men it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
'Cause I always trip and fall
The same old rock and repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Thought about everything
I'm so naive imagining and all that

Did it again, love
I got it all wrong
But it felt so right
I can't believe it

And all the mistakes
That went on for too long
Wish there was a way
I could delete it

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
"Right back at ya," cause I'll survive...
