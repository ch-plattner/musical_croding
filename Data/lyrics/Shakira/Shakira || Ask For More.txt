
I'd rather dance in the air than lie on the ground.
I'd rather open my ears than shut out the sound.
Travel to the ends of the earth, and tell you what I found.

I'd rather kneel down and pray than scream at the sun.
Prefer to know, than to hide from my skeletons.
I don't want to sit down and cry while watching others run.
If I missed the bus more than once, I'm not the only one.

Don't wanna wait around for things to come to me.
'Cause when my hands are tied, they struggle to be free.
And if they steal my eyes, I'll find a new way to see.

The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.
The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that never stops burning.
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.

Prefer a thousand hello's to just one goodbye.
Prefer the pain of the truth to a pretty lie.
Listen to the words in my head, although they may not rhyme.
Listen to the voice in my heart, somedays it's so sublime.

Don't wanna wait around for things to come to me.
'Cause when my hands are tied, they struggle to be free.
And if they steal my eyes, I'll find a new way to see.

The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.
The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that always burning.
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.

The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.
The world is forever turning, and there's a thought that always burning.
If I'm pounding at your door, it's because I'm here to ask for more.
