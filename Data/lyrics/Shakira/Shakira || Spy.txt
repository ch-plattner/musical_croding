
Slow motion 
Blinds are see through 
Let your mind go 
Imagine that I kiss you 

Turn off the lights and open up your eyes now 
You can take a glimpse into my soul for tonight 

Do you got the heat off girl? Yes I do 
Can you turn up the temperature? You bet I could 
Colombian with a swagger. Yes I am 

Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna 
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna 

[Chorus:]
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
You like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
Won't you like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
Keep an eye on me 
But if you want it got to let it be 

I know you 
Dream about me 
And it turns me on to think about it 
This is the finest game 
It ain't even got a name 
I just wanna see how far it takes us tonight 

Do you got the music on girl? Yes I do 
Can you get a little closer? You bet I could 
Colombian with a swagger. Yes I am 

Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna 
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna 
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna 

[Chorus:]
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
You like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
Won't you like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
Keep an eye on me 
But if you want it got to let it be 

When the dog's away that's when the cat's play 
You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy 
Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to ride 

When the cat's away that's when the mouse play 

You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy 
Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to die, die die 

[Chorus:]
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
You like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
There's a spy by my window 
I know it's you 
Won't you like to keep an eye on me 
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
Keep an eye on me 
But if you want it got to let it be 

Lipstick's on 
Stockings up 
Skirt's short 
Heels are high 
Take your time 
Buckle up 

Close your eyes and enjoy the ride 
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride 
Close your eyes ... 
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
