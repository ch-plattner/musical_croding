
First Floor 
Room Sixteen 
Smells like danger (let's go)
Even better (let's go)
Set your goals 
Bless our souls
I'm in trouble (yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven 

HEY! 

You were like one of those guys 
The kind with a wandering eye 
But I said, "hey what the hell, once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side" 
You were so full of yourself 
But damn, were you cute, as well 
I packed my bags, I liked your moves 
Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that 

Did it again, love 
I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right 
I can't believe it 

And all the mistakes 
That went on for too long 
Wish there was a way 
I could delete it 

Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 

Second night in a row 
Back in trouble (let's go)
I don't get it (let's go)
Gotta keep it down 
It's logical 
We ignore it (yes, I know) 
its getting better 

Hey! 

When it comes to men it's known 
That I end up choosing wrong 
'Cause I always trip and fall 
The same old rock and repeat and go back 

How blind a girl can be 
To miss you hide your ring 
Thought about everything 
I'm so naive imagining and all that 

Did it again, love 
I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right 
I can't believe it 

And all the mistakes 
That went on for too long 
Wish there was a way 
I could delete it 

Eh, eh, eh, eh 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 
Eh, eh, eh, eh 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 

It may seem to you that I am in a place 
Where I'm losing the direction of my life 
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase 
"Right back at ya," cause I'll survive... 

[Kid Cudi:]
See, I can put you where you want to be
Believe that
See, now I can put you where you need to be
You can believe that
Ah, whenever with everything
If you let me don't try to keep again
If you considerin by stoppin this flow
You need a friend
So break me off a piece of that ass
So sweet so wet, the kitty cat
And you cruising home, remember that
I need you soon, I'll be your groove
You feeling this vibe is not in June
I remember you said your hips don't lie
Love it when they move
All I wanna bring you vibes in your life
Your love consumes
All day every day I dream I think of only you
And those hips... ohhh

Did it again, love 
I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right 
I can't believe it 

And all the mistakes 
That went on for too long 
Wish there was a way 
I could delete it 

Did it again, love 
I got it all wrong 

Eh, eh, eh, eh 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
