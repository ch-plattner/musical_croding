
To be true I must confess 
Making coffee I'm a mess 
Don't know anything about football. 
Been unfaithful once or twice 
Cannot even win at dice 
As for watches, I don't use one. 
To be completely honest, 
No one thinks of you 
Quite the way I do... 
It's all the same to you now. 

To be true I must confess 
I never sleep at twelve or less 
Never take a bath on Sundays. 
Since I'm telling you so much 
I cry in earnest once a month 
When the weather turns to freezing. 
With me nothing is easy 
Only you can tell 
You know me so well... 
Without you everything's a bore. 

The sky is seeing a million raindrops fall 
The hours seem to crawl 
And every day that passes is just the same 
Just like yesterday. 
I can't find anyway to forget you because 
To keep on loving you 
Is inevitable. 

I always felt that it was true 
When we talk about us two 
I should be the first revealing. 
Sure you know what's going on 
Nothing's better since you're gone 
At the very least I'm breathing. 
And you won't be returning 
Nothing left to tell 
I know you so well... 
What will I ever do without you? 

The sky is seeing a million raindrops fall 
The hours seem to crawl 
And every day that passes is just the same 
Just like yesterday. 
I can't find anyway to forget you because 
To keep on loving you 
Is inevitable. 

I always felt that it was true 
When we talk about us two 
I should be the first revealing...
