
Essa bola vai rolar
Tudo é tapete verde
Quando a bola chega la
Coração fica na rede, na rede, na rede
Olá [2x]

La la la la [10x]
I dare you
(Lego, Lego, Lego, Lego)

Feel how the planet's
Become one
Beats like a drum
To the same rhythm

Hear the whistle
Kick the ball
The entire world
Soars like an eagle

In Rio we play
Like we dance
Only today
There's no tomorrow

Leave all behind
In this place
There's no space
For fear or sorrow

Is it true that you want it?
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare, can you feel it?

La la la la la
I dare you
(Lego, Lego)

You have arrived
It's the place
No more doubts
The time is coming

Feel how the planet's
Become one
Like a drum
Destiny's calling

German, Colombians
Spanish and French
Off the bench
You gotta own it

Down here we play
Like we dance
It's Brazil
And now you know it

Is it true that you want it?
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare, can you feel it?

La la la la la
I dare you

Is it true that you want it?
Then act like you mean it
The whole world is watching
It's truth or dare, can you feel it?

La la la la la
I dare you
(Lego, Lego, Lego, Lego)
