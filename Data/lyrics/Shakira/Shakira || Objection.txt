It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me you don't care
If I'm alive or dead, so

[Chorus:]
Objection
I don't want to be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free,
And i'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way
I've got to get away

Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
But you've got to know small things also count
Better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about, so

[Chorus (with a slight change)]
?- The angles of this triangle ?-

I wish there was a chance for
You and me
I wish you couldn't find a place
to be away from me

This is pathetic
And sardonic
And sadistic
And psychotic
Tango is not for three
Was never meant to be
But you can try it
Rehearse it
Or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Don't you count on me boy

[Chorus]
