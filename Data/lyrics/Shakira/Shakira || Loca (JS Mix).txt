Dance or die...
Loca...
Loca...

She's playin' dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like (ahh!)
Be careful amigo
she’s talkin and walkin just to wake you up
She’d die for your love
But your love’s only mine, boy

Sigo tranquila
Like I’m on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin’ my Corona
Like it’s nothin’ goin' on
I ain’t leavin’ you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it
So give him up

And I’m crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain’t easy (loca, loca, loca)
I’m crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
Crazy but you like it

That girl is a naughta
I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente
Got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I’m runnin’ shit and I’m lovin’ it
She’s got a mean lil’ butt,
But you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (down low, down low)
I can never get enough (oh no, oh no)
She gives me the runaround,
But I stay chasin’
But I mean, yo, I’m in love
With a crazy girl
But it’s all good
And it’s fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Aye, papi"

And I’m crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain’t easy (loca, loca, loca)
I’m crazy but you like it
Crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)

You’re the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got one kiki

You’re the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got my kiki

There’s a lot of things
That I’d do to please you
Take you to the medico por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
Cuz we’re dancin' Mambo
Oh, what she don't allow it?

I really can't help it
If I make the lady loca
I don’t want no trouble
I just wanna hit the (Ooh!)

And I’m crazy, but you like it
‘Cause the kinda girl like me
They're running out of in the market
You like that it ain’t easy (loca, loca, loca)
I’m crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
Crazy but you like it (Dios Mío)

That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)

Loca
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)

You’re the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she’s got it all
I got my kiki

And I’m crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain’t easy (loca, loca, loca)
La loca, la loca, la loca (loca)
Loca (loca)
