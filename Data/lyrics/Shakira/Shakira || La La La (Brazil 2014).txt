[Intro: Carlinhos Brown]
Essa bola vai rolar
O mundo é um tapete verde
Quando a bola chega lá
Coração fica na rede, na rede, na rede
Ola, ola

[Chorus:]
La la la la la [6x]
La!
I dare you

[Beat Break]
Leggo [4x]

Feel how the planet, become one
Beats like a drum to the same rhythm
Hear the whistle, kick the ball
The entire world soars like an eagle
In Rio we play, like we dance
Only today there's no tomorrow
Leave all behind, in this place
There's no space for fear or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus:]
Is it true that you want it?
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare, can you feel it?

[Chorus]

[Beat Break]
Leggo [2x]

You have arrived, it's the place
No more doubts the time is coming
Feel how the planet, become one
Like a drum destiny's calling
German, Colombians, Spanish and French
Off the bench you gotta own it
Down here we play, like we dance
It's Brazil and now you know it

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Chorus 2x]

[Beat Break]
Leggo [4x]
