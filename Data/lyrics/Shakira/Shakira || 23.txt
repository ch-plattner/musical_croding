A little something that makes you stay
An incentive
Someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space
A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust
How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no
As long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
‘Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways
There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
