
Tell me all your wishes
I am here to make them true, don't wonder
You don't have to rub a lamp
'Cause I'll take care of you

Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows

Tell me what you think I'm one of your kind
You know a girl like me is difficult to find
I bet you've never seen nothing like this before
I bet you've never met someone who loved you more

You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind boy
Where do I have to sign
I'm on a board

[Chorus:]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

Better than to sail on the Mediterranean Sea
Better than to get a fancy Gucci dress for free

Don't think it over
Think it over
Don't think it over
Think it over

Totally up to you what you do with me
I'm gonna make it up to us and you will see
Don't have to prove it, it is written in your eyes
Tonight you'll be the winner I will be the prize

You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind boy
I know just what you want
And I like that

[Chorus:]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

Watch my body get lower
As low as it can go
All the boys will follow
I'll show you something you don't know

Watch my body get lower
As low as it can go
All the boys will follow
I'll show you something you don't know

Cause I know what you want
And I like that

[Chorus:]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

[Chorus:]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it
