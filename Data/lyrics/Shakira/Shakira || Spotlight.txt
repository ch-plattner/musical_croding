Boy meets a girl
Hid behind a wall
Piling up the bricks
Hoping they would fall

Girl meets a boy
Surrender to his charms
Leaves her old boyfriend
And crumbles in his arms

And if they wanna make me pay now
Then go on
Cause loving you was never wrong

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Because it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

Lazy for a while
Laying golden eggs
Some just want your money
Or whatever they can take

But hearing your name
Don't need anyone else
You're here because you want me
And not for what I make

Hey, they better know
If there is a price to pay now, the game is on
Cause in the end you know I won

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Because it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

And every camera flash my way
And every word of every page
Well they can say whatever they want to
Cause what we got is just so real
That they can't change the way I feel
Cause I would do it all again for you

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Because it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Because it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind
