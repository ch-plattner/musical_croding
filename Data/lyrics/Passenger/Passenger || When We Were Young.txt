
We used to never say never
used to think we live for ever
flying free beneath the sun
days go running and hiding
the weeks are going slippy and sliding
years leave quicker everytime they come

Remember when we were young

Look back to the best days
collecting all yesterdays
as they built up one by one

How we beg and we borrow
say we do it tomorrow
but tomorrow never seems to come

We used to never say never
used to think we live for ever
flying free beneath the sun
days go running and hiding
the weeks are going slippy and sliding
years leave quicker everytime they come

Remember when we were young

And we were boys on the beach
everything was in reach
I know it's hard to remember
and all had the years they vanish
I always wanted to learn Spanish
and travel round South-America

We used to never say never
used to think we live for ever
flying free beneath the sun
days go running and hiding
the weeks are going slippy and sliding
years leave quicker everytime they come

Remember when we were young [x3]
