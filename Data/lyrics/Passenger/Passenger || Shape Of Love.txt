
I only came inside to get out of the rain,
And by the looks of things she may well have done the same,
But I swear I know that face but I don’t know her name,
She’s the shape of love.

I stir my tea and throw away wet cigarettes,
I watch her shivering through her rain sodden dress,
I know her make up runs and her hair may be a mess,
But she’s the shape of love.

I don’t ever want the rain to stop,
I don’t ever want to leave this coffee shop,
I don’t ever want the clouds to part,
Cos the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I only came inside to get out of the wind,
But now I’m here let it blow yeah let it sing,
Cos I don’t know how this ones gonna end or how it may begin,
But she’s the shape of love.

I don’t ever want the sun to shine,
I don’t ever want to leave this one behind,
I don’t ever want the summer time to start,
Cos the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I don’t ever want the rain to stop,
I don’t ever want to leave this coffee shop,
I don’t ever want the clouds to part,
cos the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart,
I don’t ever want the sun to shine,
I don’t ever want to leave this one behind,
And I don’t ever want the summer time to start,
Cos the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.
