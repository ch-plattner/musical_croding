She's a whistle on the wind
A feather on the breeze
A ripple on the stream
She is sunlight on the sea
She's a soft summer rain
Falling gently through the trees
And I love her

She's cunning as a fox
Clever as a crow
Solid as a rock
She is stubborn as a stone
Shes a hardheaded woman
And the best one that I know 
And I love her
Yeah well I love her

She's as new as the springtime,
Strong as autumn blows
Warm as the summer
And soft as the snow
She's a thousand miles from here
But she's everywhere I go
Cuz I love her

She loves me like a woman
She looks like a lady
She laughs like a child
And cries like a baby
I think that maybe she's the one that's gonna save me
