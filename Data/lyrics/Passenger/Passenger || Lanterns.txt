
Be a lantern burning 
Never gonna go out 
Oh, the winds are turning
Never gonna blow out
I've had a life of learning 
I know people come and go 
Be a lantern burning 
Your fire burns low 

Be my lighthouse shining 
Out on the sea 
Be my silver lining 
Be my golden key 
I've had a life of climbing
Don't let me fall from the trees
Be my lighthouse shining  
When I'm out on the sea
