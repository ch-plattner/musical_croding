We’ll roll down dirty old windows
And sing with our eyes closed
And belt out the high notes.

And we’ll go down to the beach
Where the wind blows
And we’ll throw off our old clothes
And we’ll dance with our eyes closed.

Because I see love
I see love when I close my eyes
And I see love
I see love when I close my eyes

Yeah, we’ll watch the stars glow
And the flames burn the wood slow
Playing games with our shadows
Till all four of our eyes close.

And darling we’ll sleep close
With no blankets or pillows
Like the Wind in the Willows
And we’ll dream with our eyes closed.

Yeah I see love
I see love when I close my eyes
And I see love
I see love when I close my eyes

And I feel love in spite of myself
And I feel love to frighten myself
And I feel love and I feel nothing else

Vultures and black crows
Perching on sign posts
Circling like ghosts
So we’ll just keep our eyes closed.
