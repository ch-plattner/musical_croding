
Pointless sighs
And lonely nights
Bottomless loves
And phony heights

There's a hole in my story
There's a hole in my heart
And this storyteller is falling apart

Feeling neglected
I let go of myself
It's unexpected
But I'm going home by myself
Tears are welling in the pits of my eyes
You're on my mind

Pointless sighs
And lonely nights
Hope inside us taking flight

There's a hole in my story
There's a hole in my shoe
And this storyteller is coming unglued

Feeling neglected
I let go of myself
It's unexpected
But I'm going home by myself
Tears are welling in the pits of my eyes
You're on my mind
