Glass was shattered here
Midst the burning smell of fear
Dressed in plainclothes

Bloodstain on the snow
Looks like red wine on the clothes
Of a sailor

She lives in a photograph
Waits for you to make her laugh

Life was shattered here
Midst a thousand mothers’ tears
We’ll need rainclothes

And teardrops melt the snow
Reveal the oil spill in the road
Looks like rainbows

Drunk upon the scaffolding
Swinging around

Drunk upon the scaffolding
Laughing at the ground as he falls
