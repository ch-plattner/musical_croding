
You remember when we were two beautiful birds, we would light up the sky, when we’d fly,
You were orange and red, like the sun when it sets, I was green as an apple’s eye.

You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing, but nothing like you’d ever heard,
And I said I loved you with all of my heart when we were two beautiful birds.

Remember when we were two beautiful birds, we would say when the morning would come,
You are silver and blue like the moon when it’s new, I was gold as the summer sun.

But one day you asked for a different song,
One that I just couldn’t sing,
I got the melody sharp, and the words all wrong,
Those were the last days of spring.

To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests,
Like a book tearing out every page,
We weren’t to know that these feathers would grow,
Into a beautiful cage.
