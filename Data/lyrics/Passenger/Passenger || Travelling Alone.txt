
Australian man, Scandinavian tan,
Kicking stones round a square.
Sat for a while and carved out a smile,
As if someone would care.

Said I’m a long way from the Gold Coast.
Furthest I've ever known,
Oh and this just ain’t my home.
It was my wife's idea, but she’s no longer here.
She left me travelling alone.

I never heard silence ring out like a bell.
I never heard silence like last night in my expensive hotel.
Well, I’m loving a shadow, I’m trying to catch the rain.
But I never heard silence 'til I heard it today.

She walked out of the hotel,
I could still smell the smoke of the burning heart left inside.
She said men are all assholes
And life’s a bad joke.
She laughed and started to cry.

See, ten years with this man,
And a life time of plans,
Oh, and I loved him to his bones.
Now I've lines on my skin
And he's traded me in.
He left me travelling alone.

Well, I never felt silence hit me like a train.
I never felt silence like blood coursed through my veins.
Well, I’m loving a shadow, and I’m trying to catch the rain.
I never heard silence 'til I heard it today.
I never felt silence 'til I felt it today.
