
There's lights on in a window,
And a sign post in the snow,
There's a golden coin beneath your pillow.

There's parachutes above you,
And life boats below,
And a heart that loves you,
Yeah I think you know.

There's treasure maps well hidden,
And diamonds in the dirt,
There's a golden thread weaved in to your shirt.

There's a kiss for every tear,
That rolls down your cheek,
And words I shouldn't hear and words you shouldn't speak.

So tell me one more lie my dear,
Whisper softly so nobody hears,
Keep me hanging on for another year,
Oh tell me one more lie my dear.

Well there's whisky and blankets,
And a bonfire when you're cold,
I'll hold a golden breathe till I'm silver and old.

With only hope to keep alive,
And only time to kill,
There's a fool that loved you and he loves you still.

So tell me one more lie my dear,
Whisper softly so nobody hears,
Keep me hanging on for another year,
Oh tell me one more lie my dear.

Spin me one more tale sweet heart,
Weave golden needle and thread through my heart,
Whisper all the things you know I long to hear,
Oh tell me one more lie my dear.
