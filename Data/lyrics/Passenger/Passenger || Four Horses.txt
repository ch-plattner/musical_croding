
Four horses pull a carriage through an empty street
And though the day is cold & still they are not
breathing They make no sound at all

As easily as water finds its way to ground
They bleed into the brick and are gone

And I have seen what I have seen as I fall
Like a whisper in the dome of St Paul
The drowning man's forgot what he's called
But he illuminates our town for us all

Walk up the narrow staircase from the balcony
And at the top go out and grip the golden railing
The view from up here really takes your breath away
You step out of of your skin and you're gone

So follow me down to the riverside, honey
We can pack our bags and take all our money
We can fly away, we can fly away

Take me down to the railway tracks
We can cross the bridge where the sun sets, baby
We can fly away, we can fly away

Take me down, take me down
Fly away, fly away

The day is cold and still and there's no reason
To make a sound at all
As easily as water finds its way to ground

And I have seen what I have seen as I fall
Like a whisper in the dome of St Paul
The drowning man's forgot what he's called
But he illuminates our town for us all
