For you, dear
I'd lose my tongue to talk, dear
No whispers in the dark, dear
For you I would

And if you, dear
Found my words were unclear
And my voice you can't hear
For you I would

Write you a poem
Just to let you know
I would write you a poem, my love

For you, dear
I'd lose my legs to walk, dear
No footprints in the chalk, dear
For you I would

And it's true, dear
If your demons are near
And you're drowning in tears
For you I would

Build you a boat
Just to keep you afloat
I would build you a boat, my love
