
Tobacco stains our yellow teeth
And all our fingers and underneath
Our fingernails that clasp on sheets
And we try desperately to sleep
Hearts are sad and eyes are tired
And all this red bull keeps us wired
It gives us wings
It gives us rings around our eyes

We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch day time t.v
And laugh at mums who don’t know who the father is
And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love when you’ve got silicone and strap ons

And beer bloats our spoilt guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eyeing up the what’s and if’s and buts and maybe’s and
Falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week
And we lie drunkenly just staring at the stars

Remember when they were in reach
And all the teachers used to teach
You can do anything if you put your mind to it
We put our minds to it all
But disappointment crashed the ball
We could’ve done anything
We just never quite knew it

So tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night

Oh oh so tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
