Well I'm the boy who cried wolf
And I know I've lied in the past
Last night I saw his yellow eyes shining in the dark

Yeah I know I spawn tales with his voice
And I open my mouth too fast
Last night I saw his footprints in the path

I could swim every sea, south pole to north
But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf

Well I'm shepherds only son
And I know what a joke I've become
I have a honest heart but I have lies on my tongue
I don't know how this started where it came from
You have no reason and I have no proof
But this time I swear, I'm telling the truth
I saw that old wolf from tail to tooth
And I know he's hungry and he's coming down too
Where I could swim every sea from south pole to north
I could climb every tree scale every coarse
Well I can only tell the truth from this stay forth
But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf

Oh I'm the boy who cried wolf
Oh I'm the boy who cried
