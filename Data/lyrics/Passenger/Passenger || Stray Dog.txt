
I had fallen down again, I had nowhere to go
You had bolted your doors and closed your windows
Still a crack in your wall that I could see through
Saw your house was empty and rode out to meet you

But the city was cold confusing and vast
And the light in my soul was fading fast
Slung towards the back streets
And the alleys where the drunks fight

Walked on past the factories in ever dying sunlight

I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
But you never came for me

Many years now have passed
She's not left my mind
And memories like photographs have faded in time
I walked past the cafes and the nightclubs
Walked past the beggars
And the ladies with their white gloves

I know it won't be long now
It's getting near the end
My ribs are poking through and my coat is getting thin

I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
But you never came for me

So I walked back to where I'd once called home
But the rooms were dark and bare and the garden overgrown
And the door was still locked and the windows still shut
And the wall was still cracked
Why did I come back?
And the answer so thin left me hollow within
'cause nothing had changed except the date and my age
And I still have this pain bloating my veins
Thumping in my aching brain

I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
But you never came for me

So I turned away from my madness
Thought I saw a light flicker by the door
I closed down both my eyelids and thought no more
