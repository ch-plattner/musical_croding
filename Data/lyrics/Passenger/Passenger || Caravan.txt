
Pour the petrol can, around this caravan
And watch the flames take all you own
There's a girl who understands
Like the back of her two hands
She's all you need to know

Cause you search for years but you lose everything you find
There's braille for the deaf and a signpost for the blind
There's heaven for the cruel but the devil waits for the kind

[Whistling]

And you follow the blackbird home, through the early winter snow
Your footprints track you through the grass
And you ache just to smell her clothes
And her cooking down on the stove
You see her face in everyone you pass

Cause you search for years but you lose everything you find
There's braille for the deaf and a signpost for the blind
There's heaven for the cruel but the devil waits for the kind

And you walk down to her window
Press your face against the glass
Only to find that she is happy in his arms

[Whistling]

Cause you search for years but you lose everything you find
There's braille for the deaf and a signpost for the blind
There's heaven for the cruel but the devil waits for the kind
