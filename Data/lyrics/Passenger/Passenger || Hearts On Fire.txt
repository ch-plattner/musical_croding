
Well I don't know how and I don't know why
But when something's living well you can't say die
You feel like laughing but you start to cry
I don't know how and I don't know why

Well I don't have many and I don't have much
In fact I don't have any but I've got enough
'Cause I know those eyes and I know that touch
I don't have many and I don't have much

But oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
For you

Well I don't know where and I don't know when
But I know we'll be lovers again
I'll see you some day before the end
I don't know where and I don't know when

Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire

You know those love songs break your heart (Ha-a-a-a)
You know those love songs break your heart (Ha-a-a-a)
You know those love songs break your heart (Ha-a-a-a)

Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
For you
For you oh
