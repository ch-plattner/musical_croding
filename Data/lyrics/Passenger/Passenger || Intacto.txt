Well if love is blind,
Then home’s where the heart is
How we ever gonna get back where we started
From now on, run with blindfolds
Into the woods till the trees knock us out cold
Winds shriek like drunken females
On a hen night, last bit of fun,
Till he breaks her heart in a text or an email
She can deal with the bastard son

We’ve got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road
We see a light in the dark but it’s fading like hope
I’ll make a promise just to break it for the sake of it
We think that we’re honest but truth is what we make it to be

Well a stitch in time saves nine, that’s fine
But we’ve all been proper stitched up this time
It’s a right old mess at a grand old time
Right and left, in front and behind
It’s Sunday, Sunday, another bloody Sunday
Just a day till another bloody Monday
Morning, yawning, boring, snoring
In front of the boss when you just got a warning

We’ve got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road
We see a light in the dark but it’s fading like hope
I’ll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me
Just so there’s someone else to blame when it all falls down
When it all falls down, down, down
When it all falls down, down

So let’s get some fire in our hearts,
And a yellow brick road
I’m getting bored of the dark,
We could turn the lights on, you know
I’ll make a promise and I’ll keep it for the sake of it
We could tell the truth for once, see just how we take to it
We could walk in forests and climb up every tree
We’ll build our house upon the sand, every day in the sea
I’ll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me

Just so there’s somebody else
Just so there’s somebody else
Just so there’s somebody else
