
Well we'll kiss for that's how it begins
We'll embrace just to warm our skins
I'll think of her and you'll think of him

And we'll talk to keep the silence from our ears
And we'll laugh because we're so close to tears
We're just lonely, you know, that's why we're here

Cos you don't taste like you should
And you don't fit in my arms like she would
Lying in the dark, it's understood:
We are both lost
And we won't be found

We will wake up with each other in our paws
You cover over white bits like I've not seen them before
We'll say goodbye and then we'll say no more

Cause hearts won't buy love and nor will they sell
And there is no love in this hotel
Though we're walking home we know too well
We are both lost
We are both lost
And we won't be found

She was my compass
He was your map
We've come too far to be turning back

And we'll sit on our single beds
Nothing on our hearts and tears on our threads
For we know the last unicorn is dead
