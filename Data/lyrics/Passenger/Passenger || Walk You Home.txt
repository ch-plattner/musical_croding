
I see you nearly every day,
I see you but you don't see me.
Wish I had something clever to say and,
Wish I had something better I could be.

We touched hands by the coffee machine the other day,
I know you've forgotten already, but I'm going to take that moment to the grave.

'coz I just want to walk you home,
I just want to walk you home.

Oh Yeh.

I see you nearly every night,
I see you when you're down in your house.
In my night vision binoculars and,
I creep quiet as a mouse.

Well I get jeleous when I see you stroking his hair,
but it's ok I tell myself 'coz I know it's only an affair.
I know.

'coz I just want to walk you home,
I just want to walk you home.
Well I just need some time alone,
I just need some time alone.

I'm the boy who watches the phone,
I'm the boy who eats lunch on his own,
I'm the boy with the monotone,
I'm the boy, still lives at home.
I'm the boy with the ironed shirt,
I'm the boy who watches you work,
I know where you keep your skirts,
I know where your secrets hurt.
I'm the boy thats calling your house,
I'm the boy thats freaking you out,
With my thermos flask of tea,
Up there in your neighbours tree.
I'm the boy that's crossing borders,
I'm the boy with social disorders,
I'm the boy with restraining orders,
I'm the boy yeah.

'coz I just want to walk you home,
I just want to walk you home.
Well I know that it's no right decree,
But I just want to watch you sleep alone.
I say I just want to walk you home,
I just want to walk you home.
