He's the deflated balloon wrapped round your gate,
Cut price to clear and past his sell by date,
He'll be the fool running through the church yard screaming out it's not too late,
And when he does,
I know that you'll wait,

He's the drunk man with bad breath coming on too strong,
But he's the beauty queen that strings your heart along,
And he'll answer every question in your new age magazine wrong,
But I know you love him strong,

So I am leaving for there's nothing to believe in,
I'm just grieving for a love I never knew,
Please don't go misreading me,
I'm not saying you've been misleading me,
Just not needing me the way that I need you,

He's the elephant in the room that never speaks,
But you dream about him every two weeks,
And I wouldn't know his name but you call it in your sleep,
Oh I know you love him deep,

So run back to him like you should,
I guess I always knew that you would,
For he's captured your heart in a way I never could,
So go on and love him good

Oh I am leaving for there's nothing to believe in,
I'm just grieving for a love I never knew,
You're the book I can't stop reading,
I'm the stray cat you've been feeding,
But the tides they are receding now it's true,
Please don't go misreading me,
I'm not saying you've been misleading me,
Just not needing me the way that I need you,
Just not needing me the way that I need you.
