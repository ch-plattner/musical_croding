
Well the walls are turning yellow like a smokers tooth,
Cold as a call girls smile in a phone booth,
Baby pigeon starving on the side of the roof,
Nothing’s changed,

Sometimes words don’t say enough,
Sometimes silence says too much,
Too close for comfort but too far too touch,
Nothing’s changed,

Sun still shiny in the play ground,
Water still running like a grey hound,
My heads still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing strange,
We still rattle round the same town,
Like two little stones in a coke can,
Like two lost kids at a fairground,
Nothing’s changed,

Car alarms ringing in the dead of the night,
Drunk man singing in the morning light,
Too brave to fall but to scared to fight,
Nothing’s changed,

Sun still shining in the play ground,
Water still running like a greyhound,
My heads still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing strange,
We’re just dancers waiting in the wings,
Ain’t no answers blowing in the wind,
Ain’t no saint no sin,
And nothings changed.
