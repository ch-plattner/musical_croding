
Hey I’m a fish out of water
A lamb to the slaughter
A moth to the flame
Hey I’m just a bird on a wire
Just a coal in the fire
Just a face and a name

Hey I go chasing thunder
Go dancing under
Go falling free
Hey I go running in circles
Like baby turtles
Down to the sea
Down to the sea

Hey I’m just rust to a handle
I’m breeze to a candle
I’m a choice you can’t choose
Hey I’m just a little bit later
I’m yesterdays paper
I’m yesterdays news

Hey I go chasing thunder
Go dancing under
Go falling free
Hey I go running in circles
Like baby turtles
Down to the sea
Down to the sea

Morning sun keep on shining
Trees they’re climbing
Tall and free
Searching but never finding
Rivers winding to the sea
