
Well I've got open eyes,
And an open door,
But I don't know what I'm searching for.
I should know by now.

Well I've a big old heart,
This I know for sure,
But I don't know what my love is for.
I should know by now.

Well I wait in line,
So I can wait some more,
'Til I can't remember what I came here for,
But I can't leave now,
Cause I've a light that shines,
And a love so pure,
But I don't know what to use them for.
I should know by now.

Well I spent my money, I lost my friends, I broke my mobile phone,
3 a.m. and I'm drunk as hell, and I'm dancing on my own,
Taxi-cabs ain't stopping, and I don't know my way home,
Well it's hard to find a reason, when all you have is doubts,
Hard to see inside yourself when can't see your way out,
Hard to find an answer when the question won't come out,

Everyone's filling me up with noise, I don't know what they're talking about
Everyone's filling me up with noise, I don't know what they're talking about
Everyone's filling me up with noise, I don't know what they're talking about
You see all I need's a whisper in a world that only shouts.
