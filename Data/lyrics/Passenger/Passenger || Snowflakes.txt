Every light will fade into the dark,
But every night will die just like the last,
Snowflakes on the water,
Snowflakes on the frozen sea,
Snowflakes in the playground,
Snowflakes clothing naked trees

No stars in sight lying on the lawn,
But every night is darkest before dawn
Snowflakes on the water,
Snowflakes on the frozen sea,
Snowflakes in the playground,
Snowflakes clothing naked trees
