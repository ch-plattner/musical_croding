Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it no I'm not gonna smoke it
Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinkling in the silvery night

Two sips of whiskey in the flask but I'm not gonna drink 'em
I swear I'll make it last
Til we're drinking out of the same glass again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you

Got a polaroid picture in my wallet
I'm not going to tear it no I'm not gonna spoil it
It's an unspoken heartbreak
A heartbroken handshake I'll take with me where I go

And three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken nor sung
Or whispered to anyone
Til I scream them at the top of my lungs again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
And I'll wait for you

Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it no I'm not gonna smoke it
Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinkling in the silvery night
