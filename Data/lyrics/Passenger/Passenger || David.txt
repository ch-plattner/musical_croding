
Well I met him outside a hostel door
He said I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours
I know you think it's shifty for a man in his fifties
To be sleeping in a hostel dorm
But I used to be a welder by trade
Used to work by the water where the ships get made
But no ship yard will take me now
My hands are too shaky now
And I've spend all my money before I get paid

And I said: David, don't you think it's strange
While you were sleeping
How the world went and changed
Looking in your eyes, yeah I think you know
That David, we lost you, lost you a long time ago

He leans his head against the hostel wall
Said I have an ex-wife that doesn't hear me
And a kid that doesn't call
And every month I'm caught short
With my fucking child support
And the court says that I'm reckless and irresponsible
Cause it was never part of the plan
To be a middle aged man
To be sat outside a hostel, shaking strangers hands
But I've drunk away my wealth
I'm a picture of bad health
And I'm a shadow of a shadow of a former self

And I said: David, don't you think it's strange
While you were walking and how the world went and changed
I hear it in your voice
I think you know
That David we lost you, lost you a long time ago

Oh well David, don't you think it's strange
For years you're in your dark room
How the world went and changed
Looking in your eyes
Yeah I think you know
That David, we lost you
Lost you a long time ago
