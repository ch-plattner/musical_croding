Light up my lantern, I’ll cut you a path,
We’ve walked for hours and it’s getting dark
We left the roadside in search of aid,
Wind-screen shattered and tire marks made
I’ve never seen someone bleeding like this,
Rip off your sleeve and clench your wrist

I’ll light the stove and sit by the hearth,
Orangey glow light the wintry dark
We kept her bedroom exactly the same,
Winters they followed and Summers they came
He’d bash around, banging down on the floor
I sit alone with an eye on the door

Stop in this clearing, we’ll stay here tonight
Press up against me, I’ll hold you so tight
I got these matches, we’ll let off some smoke
And maybe they’ll see up and maybe they won’t
Blanket of leaves hide the light from the stars,
I’ll lie awake listening out for cars

He stares through curtains when he talks to the night,
I sit and listen for tires on the drive
I keep on waiting and he keep on talking
Just stop him talking, please stop him talking

No, give me silence
Give me silence,
Give me silence
Oh, no…
