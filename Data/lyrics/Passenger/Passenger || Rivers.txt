
There’s wood chip on the walls,
There’s wood on the stove,
You would if you could but you cannot I know,
But I’m still yours alone.

We’d lie on our backs,
We’d lie on your floor,
But we lied so much we don’t talk any more,
But I’m still yours alone,
You said you were tired I said I feel the same,
I put on my shoes and I got on the train.

To see sunlight fade and the shadows grow long,
To see rivers go winding blindly back to the storm,
And the rickety tracks they’re taking me back to where I used to belong.

There’s a weight on our shoulders,
A weight to your tone,
You wait on tables I wait by the phone,
And I’m still yours alone.

You blew out the candles when we fell apart,
I’m not childish just scared of the dark.

I see sunlight fade and the shadows grow long,
To see rivers go winding blindly back to the storm,
And the rickety tracks they are taking me back to where i used to belong.

oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh

I feel sunlight fade and the shadows grow long,
I see rivers go winding blindly back to the storm,
And the rickety tracks taking me back to where I used to belong.
