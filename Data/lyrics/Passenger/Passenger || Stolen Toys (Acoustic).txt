
Well there's so much turning still
Watching the fireflies drown
Set fire to the sails
Laughing as the boat goes down

Well eyes tell a thousand tales
Chasing my own one around
Coffin with a thousand nails
And we hammer this last one down

Oooooooooh oooooooooh oooooooooooh
Oooooooooh oooooooooh oooooooooooh

I've got a head full of white noise
My heart full of silent fears
Pockets for the stolen toys
And a life full of wasted years

Well if eyes cry thousand tears
Do they ever run dry?
I could love you for a thousand years
And never need to know why

Oooooooooh oooooooooh oooooooooooh
