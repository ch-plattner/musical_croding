
Give me one last dance,
While I still stand,
Give me one last chance,
To build my house upon the sand,
Give me one last hope of holding water in my hands,
Give me one last chance,
And I'll be your man,

Oh I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Ohhh

Show me one shining star I'll show you the sky,
Bring all your old scars and I'll kiss them goodbye,
Will you show me where to start will you show me where to stand,
Oh for one last time give me your heart,
And I'll be your man,

Oh I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Ohhh

Cos I never compromised,
My whole life now I realise,
That its time to make a change,
Or I'll end up feeling strange,
In the dying of my days,
When that old shallow grave is calling me

So I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Oh I'll be your man,
Ohhh
