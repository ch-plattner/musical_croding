
Lying on a mattress cause my friend's crazy sister took my bed away,
Sleeping she looked like an actress,
In theory and in practice,
I said there's got to be a better way,
She said,
You light a thousand matches,
When you finally set fire well you run away,
So why'd you go and do it,
When you knew that you would go and I would stay,

I hit the wall in frustration the conversation had been circling for days,
She said,
Don't take it out on him,
For the wall has always been,
Supportive in the best of ways,
We were laughing and crying like mad men dying in the snow,
For just one second it was funny,
That she would have to stay and I would go,

I said love you know,
I love you so,
And when you love someone,
Well you've gotta let them know,
She said,
Nothings changed,
I love you the same,
But when you love someone sometimes,
You've gotta let them go,

She handed me a stone in the perfect shape of a heart,
She said,
I'm gonna take this home,
For I know you'll only lose it somewhere after dark,
In some faceless hotel room,
Where you seem to lose everything you own,
She didn't mean it how it sounded,
What she meant was she would stay and I would go,

And she said,
Love you know,
I love you so,
And when you love someone,
You've gotta let them know,
I said,
Nothings changed,
I love you the same,
But when you love someone sometimes,
You've gotta let them go,

Sometimes you tear it all apart,
To see the wood from the trees,
Sometimes you break your own heart,
To set yourself free,

I walked her to the station hesitation in our movement and our tone,
And words finally left after realising how uncomfortable they'd grown,
See what you want and what you need well they seldomly succeed to grow,
We reluctantly agreed when you love some one you've gotta let them go.
