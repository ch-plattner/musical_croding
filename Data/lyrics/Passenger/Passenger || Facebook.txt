Of your ex-girlfriend
At three in the morning
Never helped anyone,
Never helped anyone,
Never helped

Getting so drunk you fall over
Singing up at lamp-posts
At two in the morning
Never helped anyone,
Never helped anyone,
Never helped

‘Cause it’s so pure you can hardly taste it
Oh, it’s so pure you can hardly taste it

Going to parties with friends,
Who are friends of friends
At one in the morning
Never helped anyone,
Never helped anyone,
Never helped

Eleven o’clock in the pub
Drinking everything in sight,
But still not getting drunk
No, never helped anyone,
Never helped anyone
Never helped

Oh, it’s so pure you can hardly taste it
Oh, it’s so pure you can hardly taste it

So just hold on
When the party’s over,
And all your friends are going home
With their girlfriends to their dog or beds

Yeah, just hold on
When the party’s over
And you can’t help the world’s spinning
‘Cause heartbreak goes straight to your head

Looking at pictures on Facebook
Of your ex-girlfriend
At three in the morning
Never helped anyone,
Never helped anyone,
Never helped me
