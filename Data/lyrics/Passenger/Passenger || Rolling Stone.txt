
Sometimes I feel I’m going nowhere
Sometimes I’m sure I never will
She said it’s ‘cos I’m always moving
I never notice ‘cos I never stand still

Sometimes I feel like I’m falling
Falling fast and falling free
She said my darling you’re not falling
Always looked like you were flying to me

But I fear I’ve grown a rolling stone inside of me
She said oh don’t you know
The rolling stones stop at the sea
And that’s where I’ll be

Sometimes I’m sure I know no one
A thousand faces but no names
She said my love you do know someone
Oh and i know you back just the same

But I’m scared I said, what if this stone don’t slow down
Oh just be aware she said
What goes up will come down
And when you do I’ll be around

Oh when I’ve dragged this rolling stone across this land
I’ll make sure I leave this stone in her hand
For we both know too well the rolling stones turn in to sand
If they don’t find a place to stand
