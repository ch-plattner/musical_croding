
We’re all looking,
That’s what she said,
For someone to share our thoughts,
For someone to share our beds.

But if you find someone that doesn’t try to change you,
If you find someone that doesn’t have to blame you,
If you find someone you don’t need to explain to,
You’ve found the one you love.

We’re all searching,
Thats all I know,
For someone to keep us warm,
When the rain soaks through our clothes.

But if you find a hand to hold when the night comes,
To be there when you’re old and your frightened,
If you find some one who loves you with the lights on,
You’ve found the one you love.

So hold it near,
Cos love it comes so quickly and then it goes,
And be careful my dear,
Cos the very thing that makes you,
Could be the thing that breaks you,
You know.

If you find someone who doesn’t undermine you,
If you find someone who doesn’t drag behind you,
If you find someone that loves you just like I do,
You’ve found the one you love.
