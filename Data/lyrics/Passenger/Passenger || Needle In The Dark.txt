
With progress comes problems
With wisdom comes age
With lessons come learning
And pleasure comes with pain

You can only have the sunshine after the rain

I took a walk
It got me thinking
Left foot, right foot
Smiling, blinking
Breathe out, breathe in
Somehow linking

My soul to my mind and my heart to my mouth
Lost and the found and the north to the south
And the corners to the circle in my mind

We may find that the gate has been locked
When we come back down to what we really are
Retrace the footprints off the path that is lost
It's like trying to find a needle in the dark

My hands they are empty
But they are clean
I'm poor but I'm healthy
I'm halfway between
The gutter and the skyline

So I took a walk to the land's end
Thinking ‘bout an ex-girlfriend that I had
And the pages that I've turned
And it seems to me
That we all love the chase
But once we're caught we feel encased
Behind bars of love and trust
Uprooted by drunken lust
By people, people just like us
People, people just like us

You may find that the gate has been locked
When we come back down to what we really are
Retrace the footprints off the path that's been lost
It's like trying to find a needle in the dark

So I took a walk to the station
Lost in my imagination
Having private conversations with myself
And I'm just stumbling ‘round
And I wait for the sound
Of this crumbling town to come tumbling down
People say I'm just bummin' around
But I've had both my ears to the ground
