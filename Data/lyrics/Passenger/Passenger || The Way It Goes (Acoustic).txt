
One man's home is another man's journey
Stars shine late and the sun shines early
One man's straight and another man's curly
That's just the way it goes
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Rummaging around in the rain in the weather
One man's pain is another man's pleasure
That's just the way it goes

Oh we'll never know no matter how we try
Why there's a tree in the ground and the sun in the sky
For one man's truth is another man's lie
It's just the way that it goes and I couldn't say why

One man's cure is another man's poison
Snow falls white and the leaves fall golden
One man bought 'em, another man's sold 'em
That's just the way it goes
Yeah, one man's few is another man plenty
One complains, while the other says thanks
One man's full is another man's empty
That's just the way it goes

Yeah we'll never know no matter how we try
Why we're born and we grow and we live and we die
For one man's start is another's goodbye
It's just the way that it goes and I couldn't say why
It's just the way that it goes and I couldn't say why
