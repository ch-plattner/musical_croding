
Well, we watched the starlings fly,
Around the burnt-down pier, and I
Spilled my coffee on my sleeve,
She wiped it with a smile,
And told me I was juvenile,
And kissed me softly on my cheek

And her hair danced in the breeze,
Like a thousand swinging trees,
In a forest lying next to stormy seas

Well, we watched the wintry sky,
Turn a shade of turquoise, I,
Whispered softly, "I feel lost, "
She turned with laughing eyes,
And curled her lips towards the sky,
And said, "get your map out, then, you knob!"

And we laughed like a pair of fools,
Like kids, they laugh at school,
And we wandered home before the day brought dusk
