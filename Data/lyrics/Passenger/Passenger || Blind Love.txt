Trying to hold a love that wants to go
Is like trying to catch a falling flake of snow
It glimmers while it can but it will melt between your hands, you know
To keep alive a love that wants to die
You teach the birds to swim, implore the fish to fly
But gills are made for water, and feathers for the sky, y’know
OH OH OH OH OH OH [x2]

To find a love that’s new where do you start?
It’s like trying to find the light switch in the dark
But falling over mess you left unaddressed inside your heart
OH OH OH OH OH OH [x2]

But I will find love, that’s a blind love
It’s the kind of love I need
Oh well I’ll find love, that’s a blind love
It’s the kind of love I need
OH OH OH OH OH OH [x4]
