You can say I'm mad
You can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad
As the maker who made me

Sinner in the darkness
Liar in the church
Deaf man's silence
The blind man's search

Teardrop falling
Memory recalling
Ghost in your dreams
And your secret recordings

Mad man's matches
Lump in your throat
The pea under your mattress
The hole in your coat

Singer with the sound down
Winner on the come down
Poet in the overcoat
Looking for a suntan

On his birthday
Prisoner on his first day
Tired of the new wave

I rise to meet you
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me

(Which way are we going?
The doors close in an hour)

You can say I'm mad
You can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad
As the maker who made me

Needle for the user
The pain in your chest
Beggar and the chooser
The wicked man's rest

Fear in the stuntman
Sneer in the playground
Bottle in the hand
Of a dirty old drunk man

Leaf falling
Autumn calling
Dark clouds forming

I rise to meet you
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me

Bite my nails
Right down to the skin
Where one trust ends
And another lie begins

Patch over holes
In my weakened heart
Which angels hold
And devils pull apart

I'm the beast in you
The beast in me
The bitterness, the jealousy
The part of you that never sleeps

(Are you my angel?
Will we walk all night through solitary streets?)

And you hardly can imagine
What you never had before
And the reason that you're given
Still leaves you wanting more

I rise to meet you
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me
The bitterness, the jealousy
The part of you that never sleeps
