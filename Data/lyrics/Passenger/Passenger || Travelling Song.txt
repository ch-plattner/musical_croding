
This is your travelling song,
And I hope it sees you well,
Through train rides and hotels.

This is your travelling song,
And on the window of the train,
With your finger write my name.

But I could sell my watch and buy a ticket,
But my dear I fear I would impede,
So this is your travelling song my love,
I hope you find everything you need.

This is your travelling song,
And here’s one for the road,
The highway and the code.

This is your travelling song,
And I wont ask you to stay,
Cos life don’t work that way.

But I could try and fit inside your suitcase,
But my feet would stick out of the end,
So this is your travelling song my love,
Come find me when your travelling ends,
This is your travelling song my love,
Come find me when your travelling ends.
