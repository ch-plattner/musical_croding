
Twenty seven years
Twenty seven years old,
The only thing I know,
The only thing I get told,
I've gotta sell out if I wanna get sold,
Don't want the devil to be taking my soul,
I, write songs that come from the heart,
I don't give a fuck if they get in to the chart or not,
Only way I can be, is to say what I see,
And have no shadow hanging over me

I don't know where I'm running
But I know how to run,
'Cause running's the thing I've always done,
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
But I know what I've done,
I'm a hungiy heart I'm a loaded gun

Twenty seven years twenty seven years now,
Only thing I know, I know that I don't know how,
To please everybody all of the time,
'Cause everybody's always fucking changing their minds,
A little bit faded, a little bit jaded,
Not gonna stop and I won't be persuaded,
To write words I can't believe in,
To see my face on a video screen

I don't know where I'm running
But I know how to run,
'Cause running's the thing I've always done,
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
But I know what I've done,
I'm a hungry heart I'm a loaded gun

Twenty seven years twenty seven years done,
Written six hundred songs only twelve get sung,
Eighty seven thousand cigarettes have passed through these lungs,
And every single day I wish'I'd never smoked one,
A week brushing my teeth and a week getting my haircut,
Eight years sleeping I'm still tired when I wake up,
A whole year eating and I still lost weight fuck,
Five proper girlfriends and five messy breakups,
Twenty seven birthdays twenty seven new years,
Thirty thousand quid just so I could have a few beers,
Ever dying old hopes, ever growing new fears,
Don't know where I'm going but I know how I got here

I don't know where I'm running
But I know how to run,
'Cause running's the thing I've always done,
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
But I know what I've done,
I'm a hungry heart I'm a loaded gun,
I don't know where I'm running
But I know how to run,
'Cause running's the thing I've always done,
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
But I know what I've done,
I'm a hungry heart I'm a loaded gun
