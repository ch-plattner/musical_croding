
Well I clung to you,
Like cat hair clings to a woollen shirt
You needed me, like a wedding dress needs dirt
The more that I wanted, the harder I squeezed
The harder I squeezed, the less you could breathe
And we sunk down to the bottom
Yeah, we sunk down to the bottom of the sea
Yeah, we sunk down to the bottom of the sea

And I cried for you,
Like a widow cries at her lover’s grave
You haunted me through my stinging nights,
And aching days
The more that you struggled, the tighter the knots,
The tighter the knots, the lower we got

And we sunk down to the bottom
Yeah, we sunk down to the bottom of the sea
Yeah, we sunk down to the bottom of the sea
Yeah, we sunk down to the bottom of the sea
Oh no,
‘Cause I saw divers and submarines
And I saw divers and submarines
Oh, I saw divers and submarines
