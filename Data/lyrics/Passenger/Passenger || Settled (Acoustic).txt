you get to the stage
your head and your heart 
Aren't on the same page
Your heart will wait forever but your skin says you're getting old

Good things come to those who wait 
well the lights were up and it was getting late
She wore my coat because she said that she was cold
Funny how quick a coat turns into a ring
Looking back now I don't remember a thing
We don't talk about the writing on the wall
Somedays we don't talk at all
But when the lights are dim
And my time is free

I sometimes think about the good times that I missed
Sometimes think about the girls I could have kissed
But I settled for her
And she settled for me

Well it's funny how time just seems to fly
You blink your eyes And it'll pass you by
Before too long you're getting on the bus for free

Same old routine
Same old blue jeans
Same old nightmares different dreams

Funny how quick the days turn into years
Funny some people stay some disappear
We don't talk about the writing on the wall
Somedays we don't talk at all
But when the lights are dim
And my time is free

I sometimes think about the good times that I missed
Sometimes think about the girls I could have kissed
But I settled for her
And she settled for me

Ain't it funny how you miss someone
When you're sat there next to them at home
Ain't it funny how hard we are to change
Like we're made out of stone
We don't talk about the writing on the wall
Hell somedays we don't talk at all
When the lights are dim and my time is free

I sometimes think about the good times that I missed
Sometimes think about the girls I could have kissed
But I settled for her
And she settled for me
