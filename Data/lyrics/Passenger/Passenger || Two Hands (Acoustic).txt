
I hope the road does you well
I hope you stand up where you fell
When silence screams so loud
I hope you ring out like a bell

I hope to call to treat you kindly
I hope you follow love blindly
And though our sun if almost set
The shadow still there behind me

So fairly well, my looove
You have two hands to build all that you dream of
Oh you have two hands to build all that you dream of

I hope you get to where you're going
I just thought you should be knowing
And sometime I wish you would stay
But you can't stop the wind from blowing

So fairly well, my loooove
Oh, you have two hands to build all that you dream of
You have two hands to build all that you dream of
