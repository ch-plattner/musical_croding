
I was born a baby boy a long time ago
Back when the hillsides were green and the water would flow
But nights they fall and settle like snow
I watched as the hillsides turned white with nowhere to go

Oh think I’m gonna start a fire
Oh think I’m gonna start a fire

Now my heart’s a frozen lake where streams used to flow
Down to the forest of my mind where memory would grow
Now I walk amongst the trees where the last sun glows
The leaves are all golden and brown with nowhere to go

Oh think I’m gonna start a fire
Oh think I’m gonna start a fire

My skin like these boulders
Is cracking and older
With each passing year that goes
My cliff face is crumbling
Silently tumbling
Down to the water below
And if I light a match I’ll be able to catch
The last sun before it goes

And oh well I think I’m gonna start a fire
Oh think I’m gonna start a fire
And oh think I’m gonna start a fire now
