
Where, hello there restless wind
It's been a long time, since you've blown through the streets
I really don't mind
If you pick me up off my feet, just one last time
And take me, where you've gotta go

I've been tied to a mast, anchored to a shore
Buried in the earth and rooted to the floor
As long as you willing, then I'll be sure
To go with you, we've gotta go
Oh I don't mind, where it is we go

From Northumberland's hills, Yorkshire and her malls
The mountains of North Wales to the Cornish Shores
As long as you are mine, I'll be yours,
I'll go with you where you've got to go.
We'll leave England's green, her old country lanes,
over the yellow fields of France, to the beaches of Spain,
As long as you promise to take me home again.
I'll go with you where you've got to go.
Ooh I don't mind where it is we go

Just take me from here, take me somewhere I can disappear.
You'd take me anywhere my dear.

Oh and carry me away. Take me from this old dark day.
Restless wind, will you blow my way?
