
Sometimes, when the light catches her face
In a very particular way
It remind's me so true
Of a girl that I once knew

And there's something in her voice
That has left me with no choice
And a memory's renewed
Of a girl that I once knew

And there's something when she smiles
Drawing lines around her eyes
There's a key hole I see through
To a girl that I once knew

Sometimes, it's almost too much
When I feel her gentle touch
Running fingers down and through
Like a girl that I once knew

And to hear her sleeping breath
The rise and falling of her chest
Moonlight paints her ghostly blue
Like a girl that I once knew

And the girl that I once knew
Left me empty and confused
Yet it feels different somehow
With the girl that I know now
(Now, now, now...)
