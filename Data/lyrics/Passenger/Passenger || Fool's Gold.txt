
Can't you show me something I've not seen before
Magic tricks and pirate ships - they just don't work no more.
Given up on treasure chests that wash upon the shore
'Cause fool's gold never seems to keep its shine.

Can't you give me something I can hold in my hands
Sick of gold rush promises and empty suitcase plans
I won't go back to treasure maps and digging in the sand
For I always seem to lose whatever I find
Yeah, I always seem to leave it all behind

Give me golden afternoons in May
Give me silver moons that light my way
And I won't ask for fool's gold anymore

Can't you make me feel like I haven't felt for years
When we laughed like we did when I was a kid until I burst into tears
And count the diamond stars and drink the water crystal clear
And I'll be richer than any man who lives with fear

Singing aaaaaay,
Give me golden afternoons in May
Give me silver moons that light my way
I won't ask for fool's gold anymore.

I won't ask for fool's gold anymore.
I won't ask for fool's gold anymore.
