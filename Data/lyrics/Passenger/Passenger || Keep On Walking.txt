Well last night I couldn’t sleep
I got up and started walking
Down to the end of my street
And on into town
Well I had no one to meet
And I had no taste for talking
Seems I’m talking my whole life
It’s time I listen now

Well I walk passed the late night boys
With their bottles in the doorways
And I walk passed the business men
Sleeping like babies in their cars
And I thought to myself oh son
You may be lost in more ways than one
But I’ve a feeling that it’s more fun
Than knowing exactly where you are

Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Well I’ll keep on walking
Oh I’ll keep on walking
Till I find that old love or that old love comes to find me

Well I walked into the morning and felt the warm sunlight forming on my shoulders
Cos it hit me with no warning like a summer sky storming in my lungs
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by they’ll do anything to make themselves look older
While the women spend their money on anything that makes them look young

Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Oh I’ll keep on walking
Well I’ll keep on walking
Till I find that old love or that old love comes to find me

Well I’m a stone
And I’m carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Oh well I’ll keep on walking
Well I said I’ll keep on walking
Till I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
Till I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
