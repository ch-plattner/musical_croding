
You’re just a stones throw from me,
But throwing stones could never be,
The perfect way to start.

Cos sticks and stones make broken bones,
And empty words make broken homes,
But it’s love that broke our hearts.

If I knew what you were thinking,
I would stop this boat from sinking,
But darling you are like the sand,
And you’re slipping through my hands,
I just don’t know what you’re thinking.

You’re just a photo in a draw,
But photographs are not much more,
Than ghosts we can’t forget.

You’re just a red rag to a bull,
You’re just a false hope for a fool,
But its as close as I can get.

If I knew what you were thinking,
I would stop this boat from sinking,
But darling you are like the sun,
Setting when my evening comes,
I just don’t know what you’re thinking.

And I would stop the sky from falling,
If I knew, if I knew,
And I would love you every morning,
If I knew, if I knew.

If I knew what you were thinking,
I would stop this boat from sinking,
But darling you are like the stars,
I know I can’t reach that far,
I just don’t know what you’re thinking.
