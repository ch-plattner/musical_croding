
Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star" 
I said "Constantly in the darkness 
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar" 

On the back of a cartoon coaster 
By the blue TV screen light 
I drew a map of Canada 
Oh Canada 
Your face sketched on it twice 
You're in my blood. You’re my holy wine 
You taste so bitter and so sweet 

I could drink a case of you oh darlin’
I would still be on my feet 
I’d still be on my feet

I’m a lonely painter 
I live in a box of paints 
I'm frightened of the devil 
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid 

I remember that time you told me 
"Love is touching souls" 
Surely you touched mine 
'Cause part of you pours out of me 
In these lines from time to time 
You're in my blood. You’re my holy wine 
You taste so bitter and so sweet 

I could drink a case of you oh darlin’ 
I would still be on my feet 
I’d still be on my feet

I knew a woman 
She had a mouth like yours 
She knew your life 
She knew your devils and your deeds 
She said 
"Go to him, stay with him if you can 
But don’t be afraid to bleed" 

But you’re in my blood 
You're my holy wine 
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh, I could drink a case of you, oh darlin’
I would still be on my feet 
I’d still be on my feet
