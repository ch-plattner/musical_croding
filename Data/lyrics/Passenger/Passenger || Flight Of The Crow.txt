
Sometimes I get tired of waking up on my own,
And sometimes I feel like I want to go home,
But the cars they keep on driving,
Down a road that doesn’t seem to end.

So we’re following arrows and the flight of the crow,
Living wide screen but what good is it though,
When life gets narrower the further you go,
Suns set before they rise.

It’s there in the shadows where nobody goes,
It’s there in the dark but what good is it though,
It’s a vanishing point on a shimmering road,
And there when I close my eyes.

Sometimes its hard to know the way to go,
When the waters rise around you,
And the fire rages down below.

So we’re following arrows and the flight of the crow,
Living wide screen but what good is it though,
When life gets narrower the further you go,
Suns set before they rise.

It’s there in the shadows where nobody goes,
It’s there in the dark but what good is it though,
It’s a vanishing point on a shimmering road,
And there when I close my eyes.

oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh

Cos we’re bullets and we’re fired from shotguns flying through birthdays and new years,
Yeah we’re rolling stones but the moss keeps growing round our hearts and our eyes and our ears,

And there when I close my eyes,
There when I close my eyes,
Only there when I close my eyes.
