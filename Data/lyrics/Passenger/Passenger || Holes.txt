He told me about when his house burnt down, and he lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six whole weeks, they were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell you something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose

Now I've got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt, a whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money is gone, life carries on and I miss it like a hole in the head

I know a woman with kids around her ankles and a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper and the motherfucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, but keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked so why you gotta worry me for

Now he left a in hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my bed
Oh now that he's gone well life carries on and I miss him like a hole in the head

Well sometimes you can't change and you can't choose
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose

Now we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives
Where we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Where we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives
Where we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives
Where we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts, we've got holes in our lives
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts, we've got holes in our lives
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives
Where we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on
