Well when you’re with your friends,
But you’re lonely,
You smile a smile that’s not your own,
When comfort comes from a strangers arms,
Miles away from home,

And you close your eyes to feel a darkness,
You dream of love you have known,
But you wake up instead,
In a strangers bed,
Miles away from home,

Though you’re in a house,
Don’t mean its a home,
Though you’re in a crowd,
Doesn’t mean you’re not alone,
Doesn’t mean you’re not alone,

And though he wraps you in wool,
You’re still freezing,
It’s been a while since you’ve been warm,
Cos you’re making false starts,
With a strangers heart,
Miles away from home

Though he’s on your skin,
Doesn’t mean he’s in your blood,
Though you let him in,
Doesn’t mean you’re making love,
Doesn’t mean you’re making love

Cos you’re not in love

Cos you know my house will always be your home,
You know my heart is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone,
You know my house will always be your homes,
You know my heart is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone.
