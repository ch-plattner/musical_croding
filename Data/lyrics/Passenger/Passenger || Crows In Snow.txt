
Wind-screen wiper’s never gonna stop,
Never stop wiping all the snow from the top of our car,
A car that has travelled so far from our homes,
It’s never good to feel alone

But we’ve got what we’ve got
It’s friends that we’ve got in a car,
A car that has travelled so far from our homes,
It never feels good to be alone

You’re in the headlights,
Skidding out into the road
Like a deer, scared and covered in snow
Oh, you’re in the headlights,
Skidding out into the road
Like a deer, scared and covered in snow

Flakes, they fall on boxes and tins and cans
The tins and the cans that fall from bins and hands
And our hands we hold in such a hurry in a world,

That doesn’t seem to care about
Themselves or each other
Or themselves or each other,
Or sisters or mothers,
Or themselves or each other,
Or architects or brothers,
Or themselves or each other,
Or astronauts or fathers,
Or themselves or each other,
Or themselves

So, kiss me here beneath the street lights
In a lay-by, all covered in snow oh!
Yeah, kiss me here beneath the street lights
And oh, in a lay-by, all covered in snow for now

You and I, we’ve always been crows,
Hiding black wings beneath the snow
You and I, we’ve always been crows,
Hiding yellow feet beneath the snow

You’re in the headlights, darling oh!
And you’re flying out over the road, no, no
And you’re covered in snow
And oh, you’re in the headlights, darling now
You’re flying out over the road
And you’re covered in snow
