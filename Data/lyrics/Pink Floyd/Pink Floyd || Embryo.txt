All this love 
Is all I am, 
A ball is all I am.
I'm so new 
Compared to you 
And I am very small.
Warm glow, 
Moon glow,

Always need a little more room.
Waiting here,
Seems like years,
Never see the light of day.

All around 
I hear strange sounds 
Come gurgling in my ear.
Red the light 
And dark the night 
I feel my dawn is near.
Warm glow, 
Moon glow,
Always need a little more room.
Whisper low 
Here I go, 
I will see the sunshine show.
