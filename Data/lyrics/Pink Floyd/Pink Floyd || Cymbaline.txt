The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end
Will the final cuplet rhyme

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
There's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone
Selling colored photographs
To magazines back home

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me 

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plain
The leaves are heavy round your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you
That they're moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me
