
Last night I had too much to drink 
Sitting in a club with so many fools 
Playing to rules 
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty 
I had another drink 
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink 

What a way to spend that evening 
They all turn up with their friends 
Playing the game 
But in the scene I should have been 
Far away 
Away - away - away - away - away 
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
I open the door to an empty room 
Then I forget 

The telephone rings and someone speaks 
She would very much like to go out to a show 
So what can I do - I can't think what to say 
She sees through anyway 
Away - away - away - away - away

Out of the front door I go 
Traffic's moving rather slow 
Arriving late, there she waits 
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be 
Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
I open the door to an empty room 
Then I forget
