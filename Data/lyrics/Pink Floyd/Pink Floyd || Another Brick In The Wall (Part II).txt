
We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teachers leave them kids alone 
Hey teacher leave them kids alone 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall 

[chorus at end by pupils from the Fourth Form Music Class Islington Green School, London]

We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teachers leave them kids alone 
Hey teacher leave us kids alone 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
