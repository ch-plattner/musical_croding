
In yellow shoes I get the blues
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight 
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad 
Vegetable man how are you? 

So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees, 
And I covered them up with the latest cut, 
And my pants and socks all point in a box, 
They don't make long of my nylon socks, 
The watch, black watch 
My watch with a black face 
And a big pin, a little hole, 
And all the lot is what I got, 
It's what I wear, it's what you see, 
It must be me, it's what I am, 
Vegetable man. 

I've been looking all over the place for a place for me, 
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere. 
Vegetable man, vegetable man, 
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can, 
Vegetable man.
