
You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?
You awake with a start to just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end
Your fantasies merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice

Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?
Some are born
Some men die beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war, there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end
