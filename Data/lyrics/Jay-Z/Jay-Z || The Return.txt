[Intro]
Halt! Who goes there?
It is I sire Tone from Brooklyn.
Well, speak up man what is it?
News from the East sire! THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS HAS RETURNED!

[Verse 1:  Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the freshest of them all?
I love ‘em all but none of yall can fuck with the double suicide doors on that black phantom,
Fuck em all
We got hits like a 30 shot clip when we throw one in the air everybody hit the floor
Holla atcha boy, boys, when we boys so we bringin out them toys
Lane to lane on the dana danes
We give you noise man when the year change we change, nigga we right here
We can go bang for bang
We can go clip for clip nigga chain for chain
We can go bitch for bitch got a pretty young thing
That I keep by my hip like my celly that ring, sing!
(Me and Michelle at the hotel while Jay and Tone on the way to the after party got the ladies sayin
OH! Best of Both Worlds)
Best of Both Worlds and we rock the globe
You knamsayin
Ya boy H-O wit Kels we not playin
Losers lose so when we does what we do we win
Then win again like de ja vu
Then we win again like MJ do
Three-peat then retreat the waters that’s blue
Young scrappy this what grown men do lets move!

[Chorus: R. Kelly (2x)]
In this arena, arena
All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up
This is for them hustling boys and girls 
It’s the return of Best of Both Worlds
(Nothin can hold us now!)

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Now all the ladies love Kels cause Kels is fresh
And plus Kels got “superpimp” ‘cross his chest
I got a phat gold chain and I drop top Lex
And when im rollin thourhg ya hood I be causin wrecks
Man I’m a gigalo, Air Force Ones and fresh linen

Ladies line up in a single file line just to hit a ?? I’ll sing ‘em a few lines like (Me and
Michelle at the hotel while Jay and Tone on the way to the after party got the ladies sayin OH!

Step up in the club so fresh and so clean
Ladies be like damn! BLING! BLING! BLING
Hov rap and I SING! SING! SING
H to the O and the R&B King, before we do a show its like CHING! CHING! CHING!
So Lodi Dodi, we likes to party, we don’t start fights we don’t bother nobody
The good news is haters we gat a lotta dough, bad news is it’s the return of Best of Both…

[Chorus]

[Bridge: R. Kelly]

We on a world tour wit Kels and ya man

[Chorus]
