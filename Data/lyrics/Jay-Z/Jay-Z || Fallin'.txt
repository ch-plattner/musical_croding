I know i shouldnt've did that 
I know its gon' come right back 
I know its gon' destroy everything i made 
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
Its inevitable that i'm- 

Said where i would stop before i even started 
When i get to one brick, then The Game i will depart with 
Got to one brick then i looked to the sky, said 
Sorry God, i lied, but give me one more try 
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips 
But niggas never learn til' they end up in the newsclip 
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like i'm using it 
Guess its two sides to what 'substance abuse' is 
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga since new shit 
Brand new convertibles, i'm so ruthless 
Front row, fight night-see how big my tube is? 
Fuck HD, nigga see how clear my view is? 
(FALLING) 
But there's a price for overdoing it 
Doin' it this big'll put you on the map 
Stick-up kids is out some tax 
Plus the FBI Boys with the cameras in the back, DAMN! 

I know i shouldnt've did that 
I know its gon' come right back 
I know its gon' destroy everything I made 
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
Its inevitable - 

Now you're 
(FALLING) 
When you should've scaled back, 
Now you're 
(FALLING) 
Right into they lap 
Falling, they applaud and they screamin' at the screen 
"Damn, you fucked up!" like your favorite movie scene 
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino 
You seen what that last run did to DeNiro 
When he can't beat the odds, can't cheat the cards 
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards 
Now you're tumbling, its humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling 
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming 
(FALLING) 
Now let's pray that arm candy 
That you left your Ex- for stay 'down' and come in handy 
Cause come January, it gets cold 
When the letters start to slow, when your commissary's low 
When your lawyer screams "Appeal!" only thinkin' bout a bill 
When your chances are nil, damn, gravity's ill... 

I know i shouldnt've did that 
I know its gon' come right back 
I know its gon' destroy everything i made 
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
Its inevitable- 

That you're 
(FALLING) 
And you can't get up 
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up 
Locked down, the town now belongs to the Squares 
Who say they won't make the same mistakes that got you there 
And ya arm candy's sweet on 'em 
Every woman that you left for this heffa got a college degree comin' 
Bad news keeps coming 
Hard to keep something on your stomach 
You're sick 'bout what your life is becoming 
(FALLING) 
Bunch of used to's, has been's bragging bad 'bout all the new dudes 
Talking tough on the YouTube bout what you used to do 
But that's old school to the new crew 
They're doing numbers like Sudoku 
They're the new you 
And its damn near inevitable they'll experience deja vu too 
Fight, and you'll never survive 
Run, and you'll never escape 
So just fall from grace, damn.... 

I know i shouldnt've did that 
I know its gon' come right back 
I know its gon' destroy everything i made 
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away 
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it 
Its inevitable that i'm 
FALLING 
Seems like I'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like i'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like I'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like i'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like I'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like i'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like I'm Falling 
FALLING 
Seems like i'm......
