[Intro]
I work and work 'till I'm half-dead.
And I hear people saying, "She's getting old."
And what do I get? A daughter.
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her.
As she cares about me.

[Verse 1]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck
Houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon
And my wife changed again
Baby needs Pampers
Daddy needs at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely
Now I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle
Like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody
I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me
You would be with me
Sort of like daddy dearest

[Interlude]
Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.

[Verse 2]
I dream filthy (my mom and pops) mixed me with Jamaican
(Rum and whiskey) what a set off (What a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I been through so much trauma
It gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady
Open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know is we ain't speaking everyday
I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other motherfuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper
All is missing is the drugs in me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Father never taught me how to be a father
Treated mother I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no mama drama I just wanna
Take her back to a time when
Everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace
Watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still
Nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror
Have to face my fears
Cheer up
Why could you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts
You too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter
Taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death
If I isn't there

[Hook]
