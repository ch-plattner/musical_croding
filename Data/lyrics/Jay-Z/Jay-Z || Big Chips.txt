[Chorus (R. Kelly):]
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what you heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second coming of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]
Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig
No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I on the other hand relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this
Ma you rolling I'm as real as it gets

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Big chips! I can't take this
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot and coming, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)
So go low mama, give it a go
As I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio!
Girl you so good I'm swerving like whoa! whoa!
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch
Out the stretch to the Hotel, into the hotel suite!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flocking, balling like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any DA, to try to stop him
So any gunplay that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was woppin
Rocking Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
Try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want you number
Either you're coming or I one you
Either you know what you want ma, I don't even want you
You play pretty if you wanna

[Chorus]

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
All around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)
You wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Say we goin around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Do you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Uh, come on, Tone, I see you, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters
What's really good, we're in the islands chilling in the shade and shit you know
Blue waters, yellow sand, uh
Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin
