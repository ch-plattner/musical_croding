[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]
Hello Brooklyn how you doing? where you going? can I come too
And if I can I'm a be your man you could be my lady
And have my baby and drive my cars and drive me crazy
Wherever you going baby girl just take me 'cause I'm so taken
If you taken I'm just sayin' baby I'm just sayin'

[Jay-Z]
Like a momma you birth me Brooklyn you nursed me schooled me wit Hard knocks better than Berkeley
they say you murked me by the time I was 21 that shit disturbed me but you never hurt me Hello
Brooklyn if we had a daughter guess what I'm a call her Brooklyn Carter when I left you for
Virginia it didn't offend your 'cause you no I only stepped out to get dinner and now I'm eating so
much I bought extra so much doe the dinner's now turn in to Breakfast I only roll Lexus to Hug
