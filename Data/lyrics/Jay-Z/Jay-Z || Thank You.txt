[Jay-Z Talking]
Thank you, thank you very much 
For comin' out this evening

[Verse 1]
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you
You're far too kind
Hold you're applause 
This is your song not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Please hold your applause
For I just applied logic Keys keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, Opera, Black Tux, Binocula
Black luxe, Stop it I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up Face keep poppin' up
On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us
Sitting so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence How am I a Legend?
I just got 10 #1 albums Maybe now 11
More hits than a Now! 11 
That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes 
Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace
Who woulda thought by making birds migrate 
For the winter I be fly all summer Might I say

[Hook]
Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind
Hold your applause This is your song not mines
Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors I'll handle mines

[Verse 2]
Hovi Baby
We are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars 
To keep the ice cold, alright?
We the last guys to keep the Wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word Then I'd much rather die
No no don't thank me, This is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For the Color Of Money like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put 8-balls in corners without using pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click
Beautiful women sippin' throught rouge lips
Dangers approaches We're like wait who's this?
Let us save you some trouble son
What size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets kid

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers
But they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow
But they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell
Cuz not only did they brick they put a building up as well
They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell
Cuz they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill found out they was...ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
We are really high, really high tonight
Lucky Lefty, kiss the wife tonight for me
