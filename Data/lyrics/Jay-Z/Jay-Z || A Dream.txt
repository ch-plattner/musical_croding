[Jay-Z] It was all a dream
[scratched simultaneously: "It was all a dream" - B.I.G.]

[Faith Evans + (Jay-Z)]
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said..

[Jay-Z]
Had a dream I said, about who he said?
about B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig what he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so - breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a well as even I said
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money -- more problems, better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doing your thing," he said, say no more

[Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know ("It was all a dream")
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack," Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? "Duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the ("World Trade")
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know ("It was all a dream")
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

("It was all.. a dream")
("It was all..")
("It was all.. a dream")
("It was all a dream")
("It was all.. a dream")
("It was all..")
("It was all.. a dream")

[Jay-Z]
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
