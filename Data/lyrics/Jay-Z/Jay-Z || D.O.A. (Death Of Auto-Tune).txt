[Chorus]
Only rapper to re-write history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti autotune, death of the ringtone,
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making going make it the great depression
All y'all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set man
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of autotune, moment of silence

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
This ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made it just for Flex and...
... Mister Cee, I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light
I might wear black for a year straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain't for z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 1 hundred
This is for Hot 97
This shit's for Clue, for Khaled, for we the best in
Nigga this shit violent
Death of autotune, moment of silence

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This shit need a verse from Jeezy
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Give this to a blood, let a crip walk on it
Fifty thou' to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this
You niggas singing too much
Get back to rap you t-paining too much
I'm a multi-millionaire
So how is it I'm still the hardest here
I don't be in the project hallway talking about how I be in the project all day
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me
Nigga just get violent
This is death of autotune moment of silence
