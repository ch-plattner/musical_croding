Introducin'

[Young Chris]
It's Young C ([Neef:] "Young C!")
Home of Philly, young and hungry
All the girlies wanna fall in lust with me
And every hood in the world discussin' me
I hated once when I didn't give it up to Neef

[Neef]
It's Neef Buck ([Chris:] "Neef Buck!")
Out the cut ([Chris:] "Out the cut!")
All the haters wanna claim that they fuck with us
It ain't a game, niggas know that they Toys R Us
They can't fuck with us

[Young Chris]
AAAWWWWWW

[Sparks]
I'm the one
Man I'm money, hoes, clothes and shows
To do with your ho all wrapped in one
I'm not done
Man, I'm the shit after its all said and done
The one to cop one, come back for another one
Quick fast, like rapid refund
I'm the grrrrrrr mean green out the money machine
I'm not done
I'm Omilio, and interviews thought you could hold Sparks in the hood

[Jay-Z]
And you like it

[Young Chris]
All those haters talkin shit we don't like it

[Beanie Sigel]
We love it
That black mask, black glove shit
Roll up on him don't budge, bitch
With my mack, and my tech
And my vest, just like that
For them niggas thinkin' Mack Milli not really from the streets
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast

[Rell]
Those seen here we'll lead you forever
And we will not leave you, never
And our voices will ring ([Sparks:] "rrriinngg") together
As one

[Young Chris]
AAAWWWWW

[Freeway]
It's young Free
Move, workin' the wheel
Hand jerkin' the V
Busters don't let you crossed the line
Thinkin I'm off my job
But I'm on like Chris when he popped his cuz
Thinkin them slugs'll fly

[Peedi Crakk]
Call me P.C.
Tempers feelin', I peel
Look how I'm killin' the wheel
The fitted tilt to the left
The shirt blend with the sweats
Your girls skirts invest
She undressin', don't stare
Check the picture nigga

[Jay-Z]
I'm the one
Young H-O, a game of one
What you think I'd do to the brain of that dame you brung
Listen hon, twist one, this Armi, sip some
It's only 40 proof, it feel like 151
When I'm done
Make a run with The Roc
Rock Air Force 1's
Rock a bun, hide shit in her hair when I come
Through customs, cops can't bust him
It's Hov the Hustler, I'm having one hell of a run

[Jay-Z]
And you like it

[Young Chris]
All those haters talkin' shit we don't like it

[Memphis Bleek]
No, we love it
I got a mommy with a body, don't touch it
You can't fuck wit
Young Easy, I on the Just Blaze production
You get nothin'
We get enough spins
Can't stop us from coppin bottles while we clubbin'
It's the R-O-C forever, tell the public, huh!

[Rell]
Those seen here we'll lead you forever
And we will not leave you, never
And our voices will ring ([Sparks:] "rrriinngg") together
As one

[Young Chris]
AAAWWWWW
