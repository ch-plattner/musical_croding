
Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter
And the battle's finally won, gimme a lighter
Victory is finally ours lighter's up, lighter's up
History so long, so long, so long, so long

In search of victory she keeps saluting me
If only we can be together momentarily
We can make love and make history
Why won't you visit me?

Until she visit me I'll be stuck with her sister
Her name is defeat, she gives me agony
So much agony, she brings me so much pain
So much misery like missing your last shot

And falling to your knees as the crowd screams
For the other team, I practiced so hard for this moment
Victory don't leave, I know what this means
I'm stuck in this routine, whole new different day
The same old thing

All I got is dreams, nobody else can see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment to make history

Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter
And the battle's finally won, lighter's
Victory is finally ours
History so long, so long, so long, so long

So now I'm flirting with death, hustling like a G
While victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy before acne
Before I got proactive I couldn't face she

I just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
Now success was like lust, she's good to the touch
She's good for the moment but she's never enough

Everybody's had her, she's nothing like V
But success is all I got, unfortunately
But I'm burning down the block
Hoping in and out of V

But something tells me that there's much more to see
Before I get killed 'cause I can't get robbed
So before me, success and death menage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together to make history

Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter
And the battle's finally won lighter's up
Victory is finally ours, lighter's up
History so long, so long, so long, so long

Now history is mine, it taste so sweet
She's my trophy wife, your coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me

He's my legacy, son I'm a hard work
Future of my past, he'll explain who I be
Rank me among the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
If I ain't number one then I failed you victory

Ain't in it for the fame that dies in within weeks
Ain't in it for the money, can't take me when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you breathe
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe

I leave all I am in the hands of history
That's my last will, testimony
This is much more than a song, it's a baby shower
I've been waiting for this hour, history you're ours

Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle's finally won
Victory is finally ours
History so long, so long, so long, so long

Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle's finally won
Victory is finally ours
History so long, so long, so long, so long
