Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass

[Verse 1]
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your head in my crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill y'all know y'all can't fuck around

'Pard my Parisian
It's Hov time in no time
It's fuck all y'all season
It's Bordeauxs and Burgundies
Flush out a Riesling
When's Hov's out, those hoes out
Y'all put y'all weaves in
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Spent all my euros
On tuxes and weird clothes
I party with weirdoes
Yeah Hov, yeah Hov

Pardon my laughing y'all only flagging on beats nigga
Pardon my laughing I happen to think you sweet
