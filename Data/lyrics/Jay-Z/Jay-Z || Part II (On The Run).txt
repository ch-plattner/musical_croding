[Intro: Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get the bustin' before the cops come running
Chunking deuces, chugging D'USSE
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off
If things ring off
My nails get dirty
My past ain't pretty, my lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'm a wave this tech, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat
Push your motherfucking wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi
She was a good girl 'til she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e
Screaming...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death
Let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Verse 5: Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge]

[Verse 6: Beyoncé]
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
Without you I got nothing to lose
