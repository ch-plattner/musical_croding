Tell these niggaas pull their fuckin' skirt down

Niggas snitching switching teams
Out there telling bitches things
Industry talk behind your back
Ain't nobody got time for that
Facts only
Everything real in my raps only
Every nigga real in my clique really
Even the girls keep it two hundred and trilly
It's la familia
