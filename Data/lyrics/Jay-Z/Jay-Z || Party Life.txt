Oh...
I like the party life...
Break Out The Red Lights
The city in bright lights
Welcome To The Party Life
These girls dressin' skintight...
Welcome to the 70's--Sweet!

Ordered some Patreezy
While talkin' to this breezy
Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit?
It should thank me
I make it look good to be this hood,
Meyer Lansky mixed with lucky lefty
Gangster, effortlessly
Poppa was a rolling stone-its in my ancestry
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY

(Baby I, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the Espy....
I'm really in another league, babe.......
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,)

I'm on her bra strap, she's on my dick
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my bitch
I be the boss of that, I'm on her shit
So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig
She's my little quarterback ....ya dig?
Cause I'm all that in the sack ....ya, ya dig?
I spoiled her
Foiled it if you fakin', Jack
She's used to million-dollar vacations
Fuck you all gonna do with that?

When you're blue
You got nothin' to do
(Ay, baby, see,....
When you're used to Filet Mignon,)
Head into the party life
(Its kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper...)
If you're feelin' low
We got to go
(Its your choice though, baby....)
Get into the party life

Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?
(Yeah, baby....)
Is you headin' to the party life?
(Is you rollin'?
You can stall out or ball out....)
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?
Is you headin' to the party life?
(Make a choice....
Its so gangster, baby....)
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?

Sippin' on my vino
Got me cooler than Pacino
When DeNiro put together my real life its like CASINO
They should pay me for some B-roll
Takin' G-strolls through the ghee-to
When rap-p-p-pid fire's just a necessary evil
Hola Hovito', cooler than zero
B-low fresh one blade, no chemo
Art with no easel
Please, its no equal
Ya boy's off the wall, these other niggas is Tito

Oh...
I like the party life
The city in bright lights
These girls dressin' skintight...
(Damn,.....
Ay baby, I said I'm, I'm Off The Wall, I'm like a...
young Michael Jackson, these other niggas is Tito....
Shout out to Randy, Real Talk!)

When you're blue
You got nothin' to do
(I'm gonna just let this ride out...)
Head into the party life
(I might let it ride out for like 7 minutes, you can groove to it, whatever)
If you're feelin' low
We got to go
(Lets two-step....aaow!)
Get into the party life
(Guru, turn the lights down, lets keep it smooth...
This that shit you roll up, like a little tight J to...
Sip ya little wine...)
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?
Is you headin' to the party life?
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?
Is you headin' to the party life?
(whatever your vice is, you know?
Whatever YOU like to do...get into yo' comfort zone, baby....
Get into yo' comfort zone.....uh huh)

When you're blue
You got nothin' to do
(Head into the party life.....)
Head into the party life
If you're feelin' low
We got to go
(I don't even want it to stop, tho, forreal tho...)
Get into the party life

Step into my bedroom
I call it the Red room
C-cause it gets h-h-hot-t-t
I trust you gonna like it
See, why are we talkin' all this fly shit?
C-c-c-c-cause I'm the flyest
Hovito, baby
No equal, baby
So, petite n' gold
Let the beat go
Now I'm eatin' gold, baby
Hovito, baby
No equal, baby
So, petite n' gold
Let the beat go
Now can we go crazy?....
(Ooh!!!......)

When you're blue
You got nothin' to do
Head into the party life
If you're feelin' low
We got to go
Get into the party life.....

(Yo...nothin' in the world makes me sadder than to see a lonely girl....)
