
If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you

Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your colors
Show me all

[x2:]
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be

A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence
And that's not for me [x3]

Only in summertime [x4]

Things will change with time [x2]
Only in summertime

[x2:]
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be

Only in summertime [x2]
Things will change with time [x2]
Only in summertime
