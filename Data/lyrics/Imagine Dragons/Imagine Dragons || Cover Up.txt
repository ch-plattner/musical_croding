There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Oh, you look so alive
Did you think that we'd cry tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd cry?
Oh, can you feel my heart?
I think I feel it, too
Did you think that we'd die tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd die?

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies it to the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
