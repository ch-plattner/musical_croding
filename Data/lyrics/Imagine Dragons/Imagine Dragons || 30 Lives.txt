
Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown 
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see 
'Cause thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend 
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright 
Alright

Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

But lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend 
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright

Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright 
Alright
