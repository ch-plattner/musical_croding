
Oh quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later

[Pre-Chorus:]
I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

[Chorus:]
So pray for me brother
I need redemption
I'm just a man
A man on a mission
I want no trouble [x4]
Pray for me sister
Give me a mention
I got no faith
And, oh, did I mention
I want no trouble [x4]

Oh pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Maybe you could save my soul
Cause of all the things that I don't know
Maybe you could save my soul
Cause of all the things that I don't know

[Chorus]
