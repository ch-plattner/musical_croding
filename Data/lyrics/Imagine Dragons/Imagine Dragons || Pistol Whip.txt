
I can see clearly, I can see clearly [x3]
What you meeeeean

Oh my dear it's a pistol whip to my, 
Broken heart and the stars are spinning, 
So I pick one up and put it on my shoulder,
Look look look

You're a world class case I'll punch my stomach,
All the people sing, they're rolling over,
With my hand on my shoulder, oh with a star like I told ya,
Pace pace pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit,
But I'll pop your bubble, lets talk it over.
Count your loss, but being a killer,
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ooohhhh

I can see clearly, I can see clearly [x3]
What you meeeeean

Shadow [?] and breathing heavy,
I fall four flights up, halfway steady,
With my hand on my shoulder, oh with a star like I told ya,
Look look look

Imma take ten steps and close my eyes, 
Turn around and draw to my surprise,
I clutch my heart and scream YEEHAAW!
Pace pace pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit,
But I'll pop your bubble, lets talk it over.
Count your loss, but being a killer,
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ooohhhh

I don't want to hear the words leave your lips,
Love's lyrics leave your missing life.
Tell yourself and look through the crosshair,
Tie that blindfold tight.
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got (a lot)
I got a lot to, a lot hear.
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got (a lot)
I got a lot to, a lot to hear.
I don't want to hear you say you believe when you don't!

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit,
But I'll pop your bubble, lets talk it over.
Count your loss, but being a killer,
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ooohhhh

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit,
But I'll pop your bubble, lets talk it over.
Count your loss, but being a killer,
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ooohhhh
