I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you 
It lights up your eyes

Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
They ask us why 
Gather all around down and stare on down
Into the dark, dark pit
Don’t go, please don’t go

But they step on in, they fall all in
They walk all over you
One step at a time they all walk in a line down a false, false hope

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound here

If I had one wish, I’d fill up that pit
I’d fill up that pit
I’d cry ‘til it filled to the brim
You’d swim to the top, and I’d grab your hand

How can I, how can I convince you to stay
Where all the flowers bloom and the grass, it sways?
And the rain, it pours and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow, and the falling crow 
Soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in 
Oh, you follow it in

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you 
It lights up your eyes

I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound here

If I had one wish, I’d fill up that pit
I’d fill up that pit
I’d cry ‘til it filled to the brim
You’d swim to the top, and I’d grab your hand
