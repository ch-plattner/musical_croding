
Maybe I’m broken
Maybe I’m wrong
I could’ve spoken sooner than I should have
Only the good die old
That’s what they told me
But I don’t know

Maybe I’m breaking up with myself
Maybe I’m thinking I should just keep to the things that I’ve been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do you know?
Do you know?
You’re all I know
You’re all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You’re all I know
You’re all I know

[Chorus:]
I’m ready for the fall
I’m ready for everything that I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

Maybe I’m destined to be distraught
Always a reason
Breaking me down to my knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light
Maybe I’m breaking up with myself
Maybe I’m thinking I should just keep to the things that I’ve been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

[Pre-Chorus x2]
[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You were the one [x3]
Who helped me see

You were the one [x2]
Oh you gave it all to me

[Repeat Bridge x6]

I’m ready for the fall
Ready for the leaves

Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
