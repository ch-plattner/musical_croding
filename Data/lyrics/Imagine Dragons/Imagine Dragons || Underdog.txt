
Early morning take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top
Early morning wake me up
Father, father, father
This is not enough

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!

Early evening settle down
Father, father, father
Who am I to blame?
Early evening hush me over
Father, father, father
Are we just the same?

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!

Living the low life
Low life low life
Living the low life
Low life low life
Living the low life

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, Hey!
