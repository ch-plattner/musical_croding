It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about
A sudden attraction.

Between two
With a few
Of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds
But it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
The last to be basked in your presence
Ooh.

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime.

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you.

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Ohh.

Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical.

Oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh woah.
Oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh woah.

She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream
Feelings roll down like thunder.

I never met my match
Melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble.

For the first time in my life
I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand
I don't know when it's art.

When I laugh she must smile
When I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you.

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Ohh.

Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical.

Oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh
Yeah
Yeah.
Woah woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh woah.

Oh be easy on me baby
I'm a sensitive mess
You're a beautiful girl
Nothing else, nothing less.

Just tell me what you're feeling
What I know to be true
And I'll give all that I have
Baby I'll give it all to you.
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence.
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical ooh!
Woah woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh.
Yeah
Yeah.
Woah woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh woah.
Yeah
Yeah.
Woah woah oh oh oh woah oh oh oh woah oh oh woah.
