
When the night, has come.
And the land is dark.
The moon, is the only light we see.
No I won't. No I won't. 
I won't be afraid.
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

So darling, darling stand by me. 
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me.

If the sky that we look upon.
Should tumble and fall.
The mountain should crumble to the sea.
I won't cry. I won't cry. 
No I won't, shed a tear.
Just as you long as you stand, stand by me.

And darling, darling stand by me.
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me.

And darling, darling stand by me.
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me.
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me.
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me.
