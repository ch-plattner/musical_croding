
Who knows how long
I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning...
Who knows what's right?
The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]

Below my soul
I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
I've come too far
To see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...[2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]

I keep falling, I keep falling down...
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
Hey!
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]
