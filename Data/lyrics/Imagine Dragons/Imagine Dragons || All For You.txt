
I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun goes down 

I get tossed by the ocean
Piled deep in the sand
I'm drowned out by the thunder
Lost in a laugh

Is anyone listening
Is anyone around to see?

That I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you 
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go 
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go 

Ooh...
Ooh...

25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind is not ready to go
Ready to go

25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind not ready to go
Ready to go...!

I said, 25 seconds, your heart will stop resting!
Your body starts shaking! 
Your mind not ready to go!
Ready to go!
