Did your mother like your Sunday dress
Astrology eradicated
So what, so what?

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to fly and be set free
So what, so what?
I could show you, you could show me, I could show you, you could show me, I could show you
So much, so much

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree
Oh I believe in you
These faces, they have changed
I don't know anything but you know me,
Oh, you know me

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
Oh, not at all
