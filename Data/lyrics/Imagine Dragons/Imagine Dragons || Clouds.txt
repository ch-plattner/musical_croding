
Oh...!
Oh...!
Looking at the lonely telegram, I crept into your room
Listen to the breathing voices of the ones around the tomb
The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people are explaining, but they don't know a thing
Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
Oh You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do

I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into my faded black
I can take you home, or you can be a home
We'll never look on back
The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people are explaining, but they don't know a thing
Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
Oh You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do

Oh, London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
And I don't want to die
No I don't want to die, Tonight

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins
All dying
We're begging for a reason

Oh...!
Oh...!

Now come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins
All dying
We're begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in how we're living
Story with no ending
The storm is beating down
But we're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky.
