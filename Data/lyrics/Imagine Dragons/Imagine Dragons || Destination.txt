
I see the colors of the world—they're rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging all
I think a little about a lot I'm introverted
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Take me back to ninety one
I got a love life there, a loaded gun alright

I see the colors of the world—they're rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but I'm changing
All of our energy
Bring these words to life

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Oh oh oh oh

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination
