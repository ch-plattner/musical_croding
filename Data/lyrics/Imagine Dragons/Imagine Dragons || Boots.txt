
Always be careful
Don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T

Kiss, lights, big news
It's open places
Question rose
Stop tryin'
Are you there, come on

What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else...

So come boots
Oh walk me home
Where Daddy works
And Momma sews
Just wanna live my life
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh I plug my ears
And live the dream (yeah)

Wait, explain you're zippin' off
Don't let it off so easy
What did you mean?

Always, be careful
Don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?

Kiss, lights, big news
It's open places
Question rose
Stop tryin'
Are you there, come on

What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else...

So come boots
Oh walk me home
Where Daddy works
And Momma sews
Just wanna live my life
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh I plug my ears
And live the dream (yeah)

Oh I don't want to see
Your face in this broken town
(Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town)

I'm runnin' down South
To bury my head in the ground
(Runnin' down South, bury my head in the ground)

Oh I don't need money
And I don't need you
But if you come around I gotta think of you home

Boots
Oh walk me home
Where Daddy works
And Momma sews
Just wanna live my life (Just wanna live my life!)
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh I plug my ears
And live the dream (yeah)
