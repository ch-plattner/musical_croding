
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a
Way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do
You wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved
