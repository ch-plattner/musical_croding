Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window

Timber, timber
We're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Why can't I see
What's right in front of me?

We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
