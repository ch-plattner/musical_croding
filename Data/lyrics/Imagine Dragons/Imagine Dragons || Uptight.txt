they will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

(hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go
why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it

When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)
leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

(hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go
why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it

(hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go
why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it
