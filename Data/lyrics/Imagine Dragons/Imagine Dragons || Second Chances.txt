Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you
I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it then I can atone

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Forgive me
Forgive me

Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Goodnight [x8]
