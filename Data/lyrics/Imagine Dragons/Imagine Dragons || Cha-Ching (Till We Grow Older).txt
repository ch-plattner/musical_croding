I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in

You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

[2x]
Oh oh oh,
What is with you?
Oh oh oh,
I've never seen this side of you

Hey

We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier

[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh oh oh,
What is with you?
Oh oh oh,
I've never seen this side of you

Hey

We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier

[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

(Oh, oh, oh,)

We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier

[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

(Till we're older....)
