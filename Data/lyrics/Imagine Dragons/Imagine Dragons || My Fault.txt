
I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other

Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I’m here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side with his
Like you were here with me

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other

Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eye
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other

My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
