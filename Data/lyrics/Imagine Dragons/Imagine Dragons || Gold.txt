
First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed, 
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings.
Only at first did it have its appeal, but now you can't tell the false from the real.
Who can you trust 
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

Statues and empires are all at your hands,
Water to wine and the finest of sands.
When all that you have's turnin stale and its cold,
Oh you'll no longer fear when your heart's turned to gold.
Who can you trust 
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm dying to feel again,
Oh anything at all,
But oh I feel nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)
