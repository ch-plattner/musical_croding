
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay,
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head, is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness
In my head

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound,
Oh we, can make it, out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end,
As long, as you, are with me, friend

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
'Cause you are all I am

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
