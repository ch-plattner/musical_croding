Draw a rumor
Flashing lights and
Let all whispers die

Sixteen colors
I'm so lonely
Let, let the picture dry

Cause everybody sees things differently
And everybody says things rationally
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Supressed emotions flying past
And heading out the other end
Our precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful...

Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Floating past the midnight hour
We push aside the things that matter most
Wonderful...

Trace the faces
X the places
Where the judges lie

I'm not scared of
All the nothings
Let's let the whispers die

Cause everybody sees things differently
Exciting news, at discount price
And everybody says things rationally
A million opportunities
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

I-M-A-G-I-N-E-Ohhhh... M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T Ohhhhhh...
I-M-A-G-I-N-E Ohhhh... L-E-T U-S B-E F-E-A-R-L-E-S-S

Cause everybody sees things differently
Exciting news, at discount price
And everybody says things rationally
A million opportunities
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
Wonderful...
