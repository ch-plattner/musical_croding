Woman, help me
You turn my head in circles
Mama, blessed me
With magnet eyes for purple
Oh, so let me show you something good

Pastor, preacher
I want to say I'm sorry
Nice to meet ya
I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back,
You will come back to me, to me, to me
You will come back to me, to me, to me

Auntie Mara,
I think you know my reasons
I was a product
Of everything in season
Oh, so heavy. Set me free again

Oh, my papa,
If all the world could know you,
You could stop a thousand wars across the globe
Oh, I miss ya
Show them something good

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back,
You will come back to me, to me, to me
You will come back to me, to me, to me

To me
To me
