
It's just another day
It's just another year
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"

I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back where I, I was me

I'll try hard to make this right
I'll try hard to win this fight
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"

I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back where I, I was me

Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
Oh, I'm begging you

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back where I, I was me
