Wish I knew then what I know now, but, I, I
Can’t change the past no matter how I try, I
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight

Undefeated

No looking back can’t live that way, right now, ow
Yesterday’s gone, I’ve found my way somehow, ow
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

No one told me what I could be

So I’ll live today like it’s my last one
There’s no time for fear, you only live once

Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
