Jason Derulo!

I thought I had a girl that could make the world stop
And if she wanna ride I'ma take her on top
A walk so mean in them 7 jeans
You know what I mean babe
All that I need is
That ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Looking for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say ooh ooh!

Ooh ooh
I'm looking for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Could it be you you
Tidy with the ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say ooh ooh!

Ooh ooh yeah
