
It just hit me, it's over

[Verse 1:]
Feels like a silent movie,
Cause I see your lips are moving
But I don't hear a word you say
Too busy out there roaming,

To see the curtains closing
I wasn't ready for the day, no

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm falling out of heaven into love Armageddon
I guess the joke is on me

[Chorus:]
So if it's over nobody told me
It's a shock to me to listen to you say
Baby it's over
And all that I'm holding is this faded picture
In this love grenade
It's hitting me bombs away, yeah
It's hitting me bombs away, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2:]
I waiting for the laughter
Some sign that this disaster
Was all a twisted comedy,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look to my left and right but
I don't see a trace of your love
Slapped by the cold reality

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh I'm, I'm falling out of heaven
Into love Armageddon
I guess the joke is on me

[Chorus:]
So if it's over nobody told me
It's a shock to me to listen to you say
Baby it's over
And all that I'm holding is this faded picture
In this love grenade
It's hitting me bombs away, yeah
It's hitting me bombs away, yeah yeah yeah

It's just hitting me

[Bridge:]
Fire all around me
Now my heart is burning
Feels like the end of the world
This is love Armageddon
This is the hardest lesson that
I've ever had to learn

[Chorus:]
So if it's over nobody told me
It's a shock to me to listen to you say
Baby it's over
And all that I'm holding is this faded picture
In this love grenade
Faded picture, faded picture
It's hitting me bombs away
It's over

It's hitting me bombs away

Yeah

It's hitting me bombs away, yeah
It's hitting me bombs away
It's hitting me bombs away

Bombs away
