I met her at a bar
The look she gave me said I wouldn't get far
But that ain't never stop me
See I like a challenge so I proceeded to speak
One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover
Love hangover, love hangover

Don't you worry it's fine
See this will be our little dirty secret for life
Cause your man will lose his mind
If he ever found out last night

One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover

Now I didn't know
How far it'll go
But I said I would have her
Now it's the morning after

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
Love hangover..
