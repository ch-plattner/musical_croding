
I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did but

I just can't stop
Thinking about you everyday
No I can't stop now

[Chorus:]
Look what we started baby
You're not what I expected 'cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started baby
I used to look for exits 'cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Got the table set for two guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again, I was dreaming
Still believe that night we shared was something sacred
I'm tryna clear my head but

I just can't stop
Thinking about you everyday
No I can't stop now

[Chorus]

No I can't stop
Thinking about you everyday
No I can't stop now

[Chorus]
