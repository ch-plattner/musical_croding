
Wha- wha- what did she say?
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Jason Derulo
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

[Verse 1]
I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself (myself)
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else

So, no, I know I should've treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever

So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

[Hook:]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

[Chorus:]
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say)
Wha- wha- wha- wha- what did she say?

[Verse 2]
How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go (love go)
And, ooh, when I do with one chance
I just gotta let you know

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together

So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Girl, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right, girl
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right

[Hook:]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So, baby, whatcha say!

[Chorus]
