
Never thought that I'd say
I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date, when
You got close my heart would just stop
Thought me and you together would end up on top, you
Changed me for better for worse
I know I was caught up always put you first, I
Never once thought you would be triflin
But oh I was blinded...

[Chorus:]
I was like (oh oh oh)
Never wanna let you (go go go)
I was open before (had me open before)
But now I know...
Love made me blind so I couldn't see
All the lies you told
Were right in front of me
Since love made me blind
You made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect
When it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking to much but
I'm good glad that I know now
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has it's reasons
Every smile has it's own season
Never once thought you'd be triflin
But oh I was blinded...

[Chorus:]
I was like (oh oh oh)
Never wanna let you (go go go)
I was open before (had me open before)
But now I know...
Love made me blind so I couldn't see
All the lies you told
Were right in front of me
Since love made me blind
You made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect
When it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind
Your love made me blind
Love made me blind
Your love made me blind

Cause when I... I felt your lips pressed against mine
Though the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
I Love the way you scream my name ohhhhh

Love made me blind so I couldn't see
All the lies you told
Were right in front of me
Since love made me blind
You made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect
When it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind [x4]Never thought that I'd say
I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date, when

Never once thought you would be triflin
