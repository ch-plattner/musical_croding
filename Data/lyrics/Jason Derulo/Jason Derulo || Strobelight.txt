
Loose Your Fucking Mind
Ea, te twa

Like a strobelight light light light light light
Like a strobelight light light light light

One moment your gone

I can't see you babe,
I feel you,
Lost in this place till I found you,
Playin' hard to get, I I I know this game,
Turning me on,
Switch it off again.

The next you are here
Like smoke in my arms
You just disappear
One moment your here
Then you flash away
Let's just start again
I I I want you to stay

[Chorus:]
Strobe light
Drop in your arms
Like a strobe light
See like your doing me wrong
And if I can get for a second,
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light
Drop in your arms

Like a strobelight light light light light light
Like a strobelight light light light light

Is this a dream?
Are you really there?
A trick of the eye,
I I, I saw you, I swear,
One touch not enough,
Wanna dance with chu all night
But you keep me n keep me in the half line

Your running again,
Like those in a race,
Is it love that you want?
Or just the thrill of the chase,
One moment your here,
Then you flash away,
Let's just start again,
I I I want you to stay,

[Chorus]

Like a strobelight light light light light light
Like a strobelight light light light light

(If the lights were on)
I hold you body
(If you get this moment)
Get thing sorted
(Would you take it off and)
Immmm
(Would you take it off)
Immmm
(I just want to tell you)
Immmm
(Take it off)

Like a Strobe Light
(Put your hands up [x2])
Like a Strobe Light
(Put your hands up [x3])

[Chorus]

Like a strobelight light light light light light
Like a strobelight light light light light
(Put your hands up)
