Jason Derulo
(Hmmm uuuuuhh Yeah)

I think that you've fallen from the stars
Somewhere beyond here, maybe Mars
Cuz you're nothin like the girls that I've seen
(Maybe you're outta this world)

Without warning, without a sign
You made a crash landing, changed my life
Your love remains a mystery
(Maybe you're outta this world)

Life is ahead of the rest time
Can't believe that you all mine
Life with you makes me feel like
I can do impossible

See stars in your eyes
Smile like the sunrise
Your love makes me feelin
(craaa ooooh)

Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)

Like somebody you have all
Like somebody you have all
(o-o-o-o-o-w you have all)
(o-o-o-o-o-w you have all)

Your love is outta this world

Stuck in the system made you know
Just like gravity you hold me down
It seems you have want right outta my dreams
(Baby you're outta this world)
Ohhh yeahhh

It's like you remind me I know what I need
You take me to space I can barely breath
Shock out to my forcefield, invaded my heart
(heart, heart)

Life is ahead of the rest time
Can't believe that you all mine
Life with you makes me feel like
I can do impossible

See stars in your eyes
Smile like the sunrise
Your love makes me feelin
(craaa ooooh)

Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)

Like somebody you have all
Like somebody you have all
(o-o-o-o-o-w you have all)
(o-o-o-o-o-w you have all)

Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Girl your love is outta this world
(Girl your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Girl your love is outta this world
(Girl your love is outta this world)
