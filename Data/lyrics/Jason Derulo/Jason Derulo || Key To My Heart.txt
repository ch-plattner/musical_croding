The way you picture me, the crowd surrounding me
I feel alone so that don't matter no, no, noo
Not cause he's on t.v., don't know why people think,
That I've got everything I don't, know, know, know

ahhh, I'm still hot but some call me crazy
ahhh, Some say I got it all, baby
ahhh, My heart is in danger, need one to save me
So I'm searching for you wherever I go

Wherever I go, 
I'm searching for the soul, 
For the one who holds, 
The key to my heart
So irresponsible, 
To search high and low, 
For the one who holds, 
The key to my heart

To find the one for me, I trade these fancy things
The cars, the diamond rings, don't matter no, no, noo
Missing piece to my dream, I feel so incomplete,
It just seems out of reach, but yet so damn close

Uhhh, I'm still hot but some call me crazy
Uhhh, Some say I got it all, baby
Uhhh, my heart is in danger, you need to save me
So I'm searching for you wherever I go

Wherever I go, 
I'm searching for the soul, 
For the one who holds, 
The key to my heart
So irresponsible, 
To search high and low, 
For the one who holds, 
The key to my heart
