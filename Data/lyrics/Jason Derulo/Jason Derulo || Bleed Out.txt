
This isnâ€™t love
This is love, ooh

Ay, I love hard (love hard)
Why you wanna put a gun to my heart
I just gotta say hey
I just gotta say hey

I've always loved hard
So I'll take it slow
I guess it's my fault cause I'm on the go
But I, always cared for you
Not saying I'm perfect, not even close
But I don't deserve this
But girl I suppose
I wasn't there for you
Enough cause

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're coming home late, with nothing else to say
Can't look me in my face, I can't live on this way
Can't live on this way
Can't live on this way
Heey heey heeey
You put a thorn in my heart
That's when it starts
Just a little tear, just a little tear
That's when I bleed

[Chorus x2:]
When I bleed, I bleed out
When I cry, I cry loud
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
When you leave, I bleed out

I look in those eyes
There's nothing there
I'm looking into
The coldest stare
I've ever seen
We haven't touched each other forever
Don't know what I'd do, if we're not together
I'm not ready to leave, no baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're coming home late, with nothing else to say
Can't look me in my face, I can't live on this way
Can't live on this way
Can't live on this way
Heey heey heeey
You put a thorn in my heart
That's when it starts
Just a little tear, just a little tear
That's when I bleed

[Chorus x2:]
When I bleed, I bleed out
When I cry, I cry loud
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
When you leave, I bleed out

Ay, I love hard (love hard)
Why you wanna put a gun to my heart
I just gotta say hey
I just gotta say hey

Ay, I love hard (love hard)
Why you wanna put a gun to my heart
I just gotta say hey
I just gotta say hey

[Chorus x2:]
When I bleed, I bleed out
When I cry, I cry loud
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
When you leave, I bleed out
