Hey
Jason Derulo
Let's Go!

I got more problems than an algebra equation
They say become a doctor
I don't have the patience
Ain't with the waiting
What's my motivation?
The road less traveled is the one that I'll be takin'
Lonely days
Well the only days I remember
The days I would say
I could be star tomorrow if I really wanted to
I could be a star tomorrow
if I just get rid of you
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters)

You! (You)
Whatcha trying to prove?
Eyes on me
Like I'm in your movie screen
Damn I know I'm fly (fly)
Ain't got nothing to hide
Want a piece of my pie
Then you got more problems than I 

I got more problems than an algebra equation
They say become a doctor
I don't have the patience
Ain't with the waiting
What's my motivation?
The road less traveled is the one that I'll be takin'
Lonely days
Well the only days I remember
The days I would say
I could be star tomorrow if I really wanted to
I could be a star tomorrow
if I just get rid of you
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters)

Hey! (Hey)
What you trying to say?
Can't get me off your brain
And it's drivin you insane
Damn you know I'm fly
Ain't got nothing to hide
Want a piece of my pie?
Then you have more problems then I.....

Who's gonna take me?
Who's (Who's) gonna take me (take me)?
Who's gonna take me away from here?

I got more problems than an algebra equation
They say become a doctor
I don't have the patience
Ain't with the waiting
What's my motivation?
The road less traveled is the one that I'll be takin'
Lonely days
Well the only days I remember
The days I would say
I could be star tomorrow if I really wanted to
I could be a star tomorrow
if I just get rid of you
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters, Haters)
Haters (Haters)

No problems
Don't want no problems
No problems
Don't want no problems
Problems
