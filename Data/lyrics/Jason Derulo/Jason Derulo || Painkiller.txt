[Jason Derulo & Meghan Trainor:]
[Jason Derulo:] M Train!
[Meghan Trainor:] Jason Derulo!
[Jason Derulo:] True.

[Jason Derulo:]
I thought my heart might break cause slowly this kills
Not everyone needs space (oh no)

[Meghan Trainor:]
You what the doctor gave, I swallowed your pill
I never loved this way (oh no)

[Pre-Chorus - Jason Derulo & Meghan Trainor:]
You pick me up and get me higher (higher)
You fill my cup with desire

[Chorus - Jason Derulo & Meghan Trainor:]
Baby I'm back now feeling, how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it dow-dow-dow-down, my painkiller
You put it dow-dow-dow-down, my painkiller
Baby I'm back now feeling, how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it down
You put it down

[Meghan Trainor:]
I had to turn the page to get here to you
Love how you numb my pain (oh yeah)

[Jason Derulo:]
But all the nurses say me, where is the juice?
What makes you go insane (oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You put it down

[Jason Derulo:]
Check this out, I'm 'bout to kiss it, make it better,
Kiss and make it better babe

[Meghan Trainor:]
Kiss and make it better
Kiss and make it better babe

[Jason Derulo:]
I'm a kiss it, make it better,
Kiss and make it better babe

[Meghan Trainor:]
Oh, kiss and make it better, kiss and make it better babe

You the best [repeat]

[Meghan Trainor:]

Baby I'm bad

[Chorus]

You put it down, my painkiller
You put it down, my painkiller

[Meghan Trainor:]
Woohoo, Freestyle and shit, uh
