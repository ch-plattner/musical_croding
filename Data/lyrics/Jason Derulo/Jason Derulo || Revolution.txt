
It's so intense, the way you work that body.
I'm so convinced, make me throw my players card away.
I never knew, that just one girl could satisfy.
Wake my soul from deep inside. I'm alive, I'm alive.

I was like this now, now I'm like that.
I was off road now, now I'm on track.
Always tryin to front, but you're bringing me back.
You're wise enough to start a revolution, in me.
A rev-a revolution, in me.
I feel there's something moving I'm me.
A rev-a revolution.

You start a revolution, you're the strike of a match,
You're the bomb, bomb blowing me up.
A revolution, I can feel your retract taking on, on, all of your love.
A revolution, cause you turn and you turn and my world and I just can't stop,
The revolution, you start a revolution.

White flag is up, surrenderin' my all of you.
You broke me down.
Change me breaking all the rules,
I never knew one girl, could take control of me,
Right down to the soul of me, showing me, your poetry

I was like this now, now I'm like that.
I was off road now, now I'm on track.
Always tryin to front, but you're bringing me back.
You're wise enough to start a revolution, in me.
A rev-a revolution, in me.
I feel there's something moving I'm me.
A rev-a revolution.

You start a revolution, you're the strike of a match,
You're the bomb, bomb blowing me up.
A revolution, I can feel your retract taking on, on, all of your love.
A revolution, cause you turn and you turn and my world and I just can't stop,
The revolution, you start a revolution.

I don't know what, but, she happened to me,
Shooting out the sky, like a star onto me.
Shooting down my spine, and my skin underneath.
She happened to me, happened to me.
I don't know what, but, she happened to me,
Shooting out the sky, like a star onto me.
Shooting down my spine, and my skin underneath.
She happened to me, (she)

Start a revolution in me, a rev-a revolution in me.
I feel there's something moving, in me.
A rev-a revolution.

You start a revolution, you're the strike of a match,
You're the bomb, bomb blowing me up.
A revolution, I can feel your retract taking on, on, all of your love.
A revolution, cause you turn and you turn and my world and I just can't stop,
The revolution, you start a revolution.
