[Verse 1]
Why don’t you walk away
There’s always a fight
Don’t treat you right
It’s been a long day yeah
So why don’t you come with me
It’s just for the night
We’ll drop out of sight and getaway (oh oh)

[Bridge]
If you want then I’ve got it
When you need a place to hide yeah yeah
From the weather, I’m your shelter
So baby come inside

[Chorus]
I’ll be your midnight escape
When it’s too much I’ll be your
Geta-geta your getaway (ay)
I’m here to numb all the pain
When life just sucks
I’ll be your geta-geta your getaway (ay ay)

I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway
I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway

[Verse 2]
Now baby you don’t have to go
Stay here with me, between the sheets
Taking it slow..
And I’ll be here and when he ain’t coming home
And loving you
How dare he leave you alone (alone)

[Bridge]
If you want then I’ve got it
When you need a place to hide yeah yeah
From the weather, I’m your shelter
So baby come inside

[Chorus]
I’ll be your midnight escape
When it’s too much I’ll be your
Geta-geta your getaway (ay)
I’m here to numb all the pain
When life just sucks
I’ll be your geta-geta your getaway (ay ay)

[Hook]
Tears falling down
And I’ll dry them up for you
Knees to the ground
But I picked you up and you know (you know)
I’m always here
And you know, you know
I won’t disappear
Tears falling down

I’ll be your midnight escape
I’ll be your midnight escape
When it’s too much I’ll be your
Geta-geta your getaway (ay)
I’m here to numb all the pain
When life just sucks
I’ll be your geta-geta your getaway (ay ay)

I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway
I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway

I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway
I’ll be your getaway, Your getaway
Your getaway, Your getaway
I’ma stop cause I ran out of things to say..
