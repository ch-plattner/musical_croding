Ohhhh
They say think that you can do it
No crying till it's gone
They say what if you don't need it
You had it all along
They say not enough talking today
Drinking only hours away
They say, next time never the same as the first time

Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way

They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho.
They say push it to the limit
It's right and then it's wrong
Even when you're winning
Soon you're bout to fall
Wasn't meant to be done
Wish you would've had it, had it
So damn close now, just reach out and grab it

Faded pictures, torn up canvas doesn't mean that you're not priceless
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way

They say nothing lasts forever, so I'm leaving for today
See I listen to what they say and I push your love away
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho.

I used to follow my heart live and learn
I listened to them never again

Heey heeey heeeeeey [x3]
