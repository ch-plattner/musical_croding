I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex

I know you can’t stand me
And when you’re angry
Something about that just turns me on
You’re such a diva, but I didn’t need ya
But when you’re close it’s the same old song

I’m all over you, you’re all over me
I hate that you loved me so good, so good,
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked
Babe is so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
And the feeling’s mutual, is so mutual
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it

I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex

I see other people, just to be evil
It hurts to watch you do the same thing
But from a distance, girl I was missing
That you would come back like a boomerang and

I’m all over you, you’re all over me
I hate that you loved me so good, so good,
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, oh I’m hooked
Babe is so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
And the feeling’s mutual, is so mutual
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it

I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex
Love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex

It’s got me thinking about we broken up, broken up baby
I still wanna lay you down, lay you down
We may be the perfect match because opposites attract
We don’t wanna leave right now, leave right now
Cause

Babe is so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
And the feeling’s mutual, is so mutual
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it
I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex.
