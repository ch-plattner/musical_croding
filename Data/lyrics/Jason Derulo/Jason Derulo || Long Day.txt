[Chorus:]
Its been a long day, just got out of work
Me no in the curbz, hit that bottle clip off its ajurned
Its been a long day, just got out of court
Me so tired of these kids, don't wanna see them drugs no more
Its been a long day, got back from the store
Went back to the courts and saw some notices on my door
Its been a long day, sooo long sooo hard

[Verse 1:]
Its so harddd, tryna make it in the streets
Gotta sell a lot of (lot of) sell my bitch for third cheed
And I know, papa got dia-betes so I must watch wat I eat
Cause I know wats commin for me
In this worldd, friends are few and far between
They ma say they got your back, wont take a collect call from me
But when I found out, and I get the ballin 
That might get the callin now its like we all friends
But when im down, and I get the falling
No one there to pick me up no one to build my coffin
No mamma don't cry about it, no papa dont cry about it
No brotha don't cry about it, you know u ganna be alright without me
Cause you know that im in a better place
Where theres no more pain and theres no more longg day

[Chorus:]
Its been a long day, just got out of work
Me no in the curbz, hit that bottle clip off its ajurned
Its been a long day, just got out of court
Me so tired of these kids, don't wanna see them drugs no more
Its been a long day, got back from the store
Went back to the courts and saw some notices on my door
Its been a long day, sooo long sooo hard

[Verse 2:]
Yeah !
Wat happend to the good days I never get to see em
I blame it on the president I wouldnt wanna be em
We livin in the country were we fighting for our freedom
The government mislead em and looks can be deceiving
The keep on feeding u the lies got u livin in a cell
U looking so suprised homie who u gonna tell?
Go spread the word and come and join the revelution
I tell em real clear, in high resolution
Say good buy to the dollar hello to the amero
And u been working hard to pull ur car like a tero
Never seen a man in a mercedes drive
Till they raised the gas prices up to four eighty five
And its more than he can afford, fire honda accord
Sittin prayin to the lord, sick of being ignored
Its been a long day, a super long year
So me super showman a super soft YEA

[Chorus:]
Its been a long day, just got out of work
Me no in the curbz, hit that bottle clip off its ajurned
Its been a long day, just got out of court
Me so tired of these kids, don't wanna see them drugs no more
Its been a long day, got back from the store
Went back to the courts and saw some notices on my door
Its been a long day, sooo long sooo hard

[Verse 3:]
Me no wanna sell drugs me no wanna go back
Been doing so good and me no wanna go back
Me no wanna start drinking me no wanna go back
Been doing so good and me no wanna go back
She don't wanna go strip no she don't wanna go back
She been doing so good and she don't wanna go back
Me no wanna go to prison me no wanna go back
Been doing so good and me no wanna go back
He no woman ima waste and he don't wanna go back
He been doing so good and he no wanna go back
He no wanna go to war no he don't wanna do that
He just came back from iraq and he don't wanna go back

[Chorus:]
Its been a long day, just got out of work
Me no in the curbz, hit that bottle clip off its ajurned
Its been a long day, just got out of court
Me so tired of these kids, don't wanna see them drugs no more
Its been a long day, got back from the store
Went back to the courts and saw some notices on my door
Its been a long day, sooo long sooo hard
