[Jason Derülo (Julia Michaels):]
You say I don't have any time to try and keep you satisfied
I call you crazy all the time
You say I'm so damn difficult, and I save it with "You're beautiful"
You're tired of hearing the same lines
(So I cry, cry, and you don't know why, why)

[Jason Derülo:]
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do, you do

[Julia Michaels (Jason Derülo):]
Hey can you teach me cynical? I hope it's not too difficult
Don't tell me I'm incapable
Cause I wanna scream the way you scream
I wanna bleed the way you bleed
But you only get half of me
(So you cry, oh yeah you cry, and I don't know why, baby, why)

[Julia Michaels & Jason Derülo:]
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do, you do
Cause there's some things I just don't understand
Like how hard a woman loves a man
So I wish I could trade hearts with you, with you

[Julia Michaels & Jason Derülo:]
Touch me 'til I feel your love all mine
Touch me, love me, now like it's me that's cryin'
Touch me 'til I feel your love all mine
Touch me, love me, now like it's me that's cryin'
Baby I swear that I'm tryin'

[Julia Michaels & Jason Derülo:]
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do, you do
Cause there's some things I just don't understand
Like how hard a woman loves a man
Oh I wish I could trade hearts with you, with you
