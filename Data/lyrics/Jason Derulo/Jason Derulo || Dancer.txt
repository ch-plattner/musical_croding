[Verse 1]
I aint never been in no nudie bar like this before
I brought my fake ID they let me straight thru the door
I bought a drink (drink) saw you in the back (back)
Never seen a body like dat
Well bless ya momma, reachin in my pocket real slow
I'm thinkin to myself baby whatcha gon' do

Thats when you made it bobble (wobble)
And then you made it clap (clap)
I'll give you all my money I don't even want it back
Its yours

[Hook]
So you can putcha self thru college
You can stack dem dollas
You can make that money
Go'on make that money
A Lawyer or a doctor
You can do hell
But tonight shawty I dont care

[Chorus]
You can be anything in this world
But tonight ya gonna be my dancer [x2]
Throw this throw this money up you break it down down down [x4]
