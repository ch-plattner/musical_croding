I told you I was going out with my friends
You're following us, you’re spying on me yet again,
How can I keep loving you
You're acting like a bug a boo,
More than jealous your love is far from difficult
Searching through my phone is something like a ritual
T-R-U-S-T me, you say you’re crazy about me but you’re just insane.

Boy you beg and you plead asking me for a chance
I forgive and forget and you do it again,
And I hate that i went and I fell in love
But I know you’re so wrong for me just because

[Chorus:]
He’s a maniac, maniac for sure, for sure
And my friends tell me to just leave him alone,
I gotta leave him alone,
He’s a maniac, maniac , oh no no, no no no
And I think it’s time for me to up and go

I told you I was going out with my friends
You're following us you’re spying on me yet again,
How can I keep loving you
You're acting like a bug a boo,
More than jealous your love is far from difficult
Searching through my phone is something like a ritual
T-R-U-S-T me, you say you’re crazy about me but you’re just insane.

Boy you beg and you plead asking me for a chance
I forgive and forget and you do it again,
And I hate that i went and I fell in love
But I know you’re so wrong for me just because

[Chorus:]
He’s a maniac, maniac for sure, for sure
And my friends tell me to just leave him alone,
I gotta leave him alone,
He’s a maniac, maniac, oh no no, no no no
And I think it’s time for me to up and go

I told you I was going out with my friends
You're following us you’re spying on me yet again,
How can I keep loving you
You're acting like a bug a boo,
More than jealous your love is far from difficult
