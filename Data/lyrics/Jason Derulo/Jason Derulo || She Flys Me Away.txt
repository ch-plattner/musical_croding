Don't wanna do a thing, 
I've been thinkin' crazy lately. 
Like buying her a ring, 
I used to be at the party with ladies gettin' down.. 
I used to play with them girls but I'm thinkin' differnet now, 
Oh shes a star, she makes me fly.. 
Taking me places, I've never seen.. 
Two worlds apart, but she don't mind..
Cause she's got her wings.. 

Used to be a Romeo til' I found my Juliet 
Now I don't rome no more, 
And all my love she gets.. 
She come from a different place, 
I come from the other side.. 
Even though we not the same.. 
That girl she changed my life, oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. my Juliet. 

Can't wait to wake up in the morning.. 
Knowing she'll be around 
Heaven should of sent a warning
If I was sending me an angel down.. 
I used to chase all the money, the cars and all them broads.. 
But I don't care for them things ever since she stole my heart, 
Oh she's a star, she makes me fly.. 
Taking me places, I've never seen.. 
Two worlds apart, but she don't mind 
Cause she's got her wings.. 

Used to be a Romeo til' I found my Juliet 
Now I don't rome no more, 
And all my love she gets.. 
She come from a different place, 
I come from the other side.. 
Even though we not the same, 
That girl she changed my life, oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. my Juliet. 

It's like a fairy tale .. that we all know so well, 
And I'm so lucky that I found her, oh. 
Its like a fairy tale.. that we all know so well, 
And I'm so lucky that I found her, oh.. 

Used to be a Romeo til' I found my Juliet 
Now I don't rome no more, 
And all my love she gets.. 
She comes from a different place, 
I come from the other side.. 
Even though we not the same.. 
That girl she changed my life, oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. oh my Juliet. 
I finally found ya.. my Juliet.

My Juliet [x2]
