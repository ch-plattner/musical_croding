
I'mma mark my territory
Shawty, I'm an animal, slowly digging into you
Spread you like a bad story
Turn you to a criminal; let me see you cock it back

Bang bang bang on it
'Til the head board break
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you
But first I'll make you sing for me
And all the ladies say

I wanna ride (all aboard)
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

I could be sweet, lady
Or eat it like a cannibal
Go places that you may can't go
In my back seat, baby
You're smoking like some good good
Once I hit that good good

Make me beg beg for it
Mama taught you well
'Cause it ain't about the booty but the brain, baby
Now let me hear you sing to me
And all the ladies say

I wanna ride (all aboard)
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

She like wearing my snap backs
She got that snap back
So if I ever wanna leave
I'll be right back

Ooh, girl
I need it
Ooh, girl
Got me feaning

You a 'go' girl
I never go, girl
'Cause when you surfing in my bed
I'll be like go, girl

Ooh, girl
I need it
Ooh, girl
Got me feaning

I wanna ride (all aboard)
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper,zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
(Up and down, up and down)
