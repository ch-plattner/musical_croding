If I told ya

Would that make ya wanna come home with me?
Yeah

If I told ya
That you were my girl
Would ya then put aside your conscience for me?

[Hook]
Oh girl ya body, body
Ya know its callin, callin,
SO lets just skip the introduction and leave
You know you want it shawty
Girl don't ignore ya body
Just let emotions flow naturally

[Chorus]
Theres no time for an hour games
Girl just let ya guard down
And we can pretend like we're in love right now
We could make love like we're in love
(love like we're in love)
We could make love like we're in love
(love like we're in love)
Cause baby when we leave this club
I'll become the man you always dreamin of
We could make love like we're in love

We could make love like we're in love

For the night would ya get, get freaky baby?
