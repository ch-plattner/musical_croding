
Stay up tonight,
Can't close your eyes,
You may miss the greatest moment of your life.
Bodies in a twine.
And shadows outta sight,
Don't wanna let the night burn up, yeah.
Baby sun will turn off,
Baby let's be nocturnal,
Keep each other awake forever.
I'm your only turn on,
Making this love infernal,
And never see the day.

I can be a vampire be mine.
Run from the daylight,
Together we stay right,
Stay away, awake all night.
Never say good night,
No good in goodbye,
No way, so you'll stay,
You'll lay awake,
And you can be my insomnia.
You give me a love,
I'll stay up forever,
I can be your insomnia,
I’ll give you a rush,
Stay sleepless together.
You can be my insomnia,
You give me a love I'll stay up forever.
I can be your insomnia,
My touches is like a drug that keeps you away, way.

I touch the vine,
So terrifying.
Scared to let the morning take this away,
Dawn we'll break it,
I know we’ll make it,
Cause in the dark it's our safest haven.
How come the star are shining?
Feels so good rewinding?
Keep’em outta sight.

I can be a vampire, be mine,
Run from the daylight,
Together we stay right,
Stay away, awake all night.
Never say good night,
No good in goodbye,
No way, so you'll stay,
You'll lay awake,
And you can be my insomnia.
You give me a love,
I'll stay up forever,
I can be your insomnia,
I’ll give you a rush,
Stay sleepless together.
You can be my insomnia,
You give me a love I'll stay up forever.
I can be your insomnia,
My touches is like a drug that keeps you away, way.

No way never turn back,
Hurt me like a heart attack,
Acting like a manic,
Be my love insomniac.
I'll bet they'll never know,
One touch I over dose,
So much I want some more,
So close.

I can be a vampire, be mine,
Run from the daylight.
Together we stay right,
Stay away, away all night.
Never say good night,
No good in goodbye.
No way, so you'll stay,
You'll lay awake,
And you can be my insomnia.
You give me a love,
I'll stay up forever.
I can be your insomnia,
I'll give you a rush,
Stay sleepless together.
You can be my insomnia.
