
You make me
You make me
You make me
yeah

I nearly lost my mind
tryna figure out a way 
to make you understand
I cant go on another day

Baby I was wrong
Been confused and led astray
Just give me one more chance
Cause I cant take whats happenin.

Have you ever lost someone
Tried to take it back
But the damage is done
Thought of losin you makes me feel so sad
how I'm gonna sleep when it feels this bad?

I know enoughs a enough
its goin to be tough to get through this

I'll never be perfect
I'll never be cool
I'll always be nothing
Unless I'm with you
Cause you make me perfect
tell me what can I do
The pieces are missing
when I'm not with you

You make me
(you make me)
(You make me)
you make me
(you make me)
(you make me)
You make me

I know that I deserve it
But have you really lost our faith?
You know inside that we're worth it
Theres so much left for us to say

Baby I was lost
Or maybe I was just afraid
Could ya please forgive me
And hold me in your arms again

Have you ever lost someone
Tried to take it back
But the damage is done
Thought of losin you makes me feel so sad
how I'm gonna sleep when it feels this bad?

I know enoughs a enough
its goin to be tough to get through this

I'll never be perfect
I'll never be cool
I'll always be nothing
Unless I'm with you
Cause you make me perfect
tell me what can I do
The pieces are missing
when I'm not with you

You make me
(you make me)
(You make me)
you make me
(you make me)
(you make me)
You make me

Don't say nothings perfect
cause it isn't true
Everything I need is here with you
Everything I see so clear with you
Everything I dream appears with you
Everything would be so--perfect

I'll never be perfect
I'll never be cool
I'll always be nothing
Unless I'm with you
Cause you make me perfect
tell me what can I do
The pieces are missing
when I'm not with you
cause you make so
when I'm witcha baby

You make me perfect, so perfect
perfect
