The time we spent blazing my head like a rocket
You got me up, I put it down it gets better
I tried a million ways to see, it was too hard, too hard
Your body’s banging, like 808’s and hammers knocking
I wake up sayin’ I need you baby I was lost when
You tried to tell me I was fine, right from the start, the start

Uh you got the room spinnin’
I don’t wanna lose this feeling
Girl you get me high, you know just what I like
And I want some more, I want some more.
So let me overdose
Cause I’m feenin’ for your touch
Let me overdose,
Cause baby I can’t get enough
Let me overdose, it’s so good
But your love is just too much,
Your love is just too much.

Let me love you till I overdose
Let me love you till I overdose
Let me love you till I overdose

My life’s a mess, but no regrets
You are really, my favorite drug
I need a fix, can you help me?
I tried a million ways to quit,
It was too hard, too hard baby

Uh you got the room spinnin’
I don’t wanna lose this feeling
Girl you get me high, you know just what I like
And I want some more, I want some more.
So let me overdose
Cause I’m feenin’ for your touch
Let me overdose,
Cause baby I can’t get enough
Let me overdose, it’s so good
But your love is just too much,
Your love is just too much.

Ain’t no rehab
Gonna take what we have, we have
Cause what we have, is good
[x2]

So let me overdose
Cause I’m feenin’ for your touch
Let me overdose,
Cause baby I can’t get enough
Let me overdose, it’s so good
But your love is just too much,
Your love is just too much.

Let me love you till I overdose
Let me love you till I overdose
Let me love you till I overdose
