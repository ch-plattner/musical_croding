Prescription, addiction
Every defining
You had this
Positions, no mission
Every I give good
To the baddest

[Pre-Chorus:]
Head over heels they fall
Take two of these and
Call me in the morning (call me in the morning).
Over the counter
I'm all up and down your
Spine this is your warning

[Chorus:]
Loving me has got it's side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you tried your best
THE kind of high that you've been dying to get
Loving me has got it's side fx, side fx, sex sex sex

Make your body say
Make your booty say
All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls

I'm all in your imagination
Baby I know every way in
You'll be at the Holiday inn
Waiting with your
Hands up high in your pants down low
I'm GON get you high
We don't need no draws

[Pre-Chorus:]
Head over heels they fall
Take two of these and
Call me in the morning (call me in the morning).
Over the counter
I'm all up and down your
Spine this is your warning

[Chorus:]
Loving me has got it's side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you tried your best
THE kind of high that you've been dying to get
Loving me has got it's side fx, side fx, sex sex sex

She flow, she sweet
Make IT TRYNA go deep,
Transform from them pants on,
To your birthday suit in them sheets
Versace, so what?
Face down turned up
Her girlfriends from South Beach,
In town tell 'em load up
Had a threesome at the  Lamar town
Trying to force 'em at the trunk
And we ain't poppin' no mollies man
Them girls do what they want
They all want me, me
They fall on me, me
So we gon do milan keep calm, ball on me.

[Chorus: x2]
Loving me has got it's side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you tried your best
THE kind of high that you've been trying to get
Loving me has got it's side fx, side fx, sex sex sex

Make your body say
Make your booty say
All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls
Loving me is got it's side fx
