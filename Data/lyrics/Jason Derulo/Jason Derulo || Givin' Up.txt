
I'm givin' up, yeah
I'm givin' up, yeah
I'm givin' up searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you

It turns me on when I wake up
You're wearing my shirt, no make up
You're singing real loud when we make love, woowoohoo!
The only one I tell all my problems,
One smile, know what you solve em
Oh how your body sings, woowoohoo!

No matter, what you say,
You always sound sexy to me
That's when you know oh-oh oh-oh
You know oh-oh oh-oh
When your skin touches mine
I just wanna love you, all night
That's when you know oh-oh oh-oh
You know oh-oh oh-oh

Oh nothing (Oh nothing)
Nothing else matters to me
Oh no one (Oh no one)
No one makes me feel this way
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, I'm through
I'm givin' up, yeah
I'm givin' up, yeah
I'm givin' up searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you

I love it when you wanna put my chain on
Playing in bed throw the game on
Not watching for long, here's the same song, woowoohoo!
Oh how you whisper, you got me
Then you kiss every inch of my body
You're touching every tattoo, like woowoohoo!

No matter, what you say,
You always sound sexy to me
That's when you know oh-oh oh-oh
You know oh-oh oh-oh
When your skin touches mine
I just wanna love you, all night
That's when you know oh-oh oh-oh
You know oh-oh oh-oh

Oh nothing (Oh nothing)
Nothing else matters to me
Oh no one (Oh no one)
No one makes me feel this way
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, I'm through

I'm givin' up all those games, all my time
Tell the world you're mine
Like, like, woowoohoo!
Like, like, woowoohoo!
I'm givin' up all these girls, player's life
Tell the world you're mine
Like, like, woowoohoo!
Like, like, woowoohoo!

Oh nothing (Oh nothing)
Nothing else matters to me
Oh no one (Oh no one)
No one makes me feel this way
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, I'm through

Oh nothing (Oh nothing)
Nothing else matters to me
Oh no one (Oh no one)
No one makes me feel this way
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you
I've been searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, I'm through
I'm givin' up, yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm givin' up, yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm givin' up searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you
(Finally found the one, it's you)
