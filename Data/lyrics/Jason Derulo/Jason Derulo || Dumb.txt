You could've written me a letter,
You could've sang me a sad song,
I thought that things were getting better,
But no, baby I was so wrong,
Love without her could be so bitter,
Thats all to say when the love's gone,
I tried to force it but there's no moving on.

They say forgive and forget just to ease my mind,
And living with regret is just a waste of time,
But this misery is all that I've got.

[Hook:]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinkin' you could love me,
Your so numb, your so numb,
You can't feel it so it's easy,
Our love's still here,
But your not there,
You broke my heart, you don't care
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinking you could love me.

Where was the whistle or the buzzer,
To let me know that it's over.
Now I can't seem to get through the night,
If her mind is over,
What happened to the love,
When did I stop being enough
Cos damn I've been wherever we having,
No where to dream that sickness from your love
Or drug woaaaaah!

They say forgive and forget just to ease my mind,
And living with regret is just a waste of time,
But this misery is all that I've got.

[Hook:]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinkin' you could love me,
Your so numb, your so numb,
You can't feel it so it's easy,
Our love's still here,
But your not there,
You broke my heart, you don't care,
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinking you could love me,

I had my choice to watch
As you ripped out and stole my heart
Over and over again
You made a fool of me!

[Hook:]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinkin' you could love me,
Your so numb, your so numb,
You can't feel it so it's easy,
Our love's still here,
But your not there,
You broke my heart, you don't care.
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb,
For thinking you could love me.
