That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

Now get on over here, and get up on this bed
I'm all upon you, now lock me and whip your legs
Pulled your shirt to the left and kissed that one
Pulled yout shirt to the right, how did I miss that one
I really want it, but I love it that you're teasing it
Once I start I ain't gon' stop until I'm pleasing it
Almost time to come up out them jeans, you know exactly what I mean

As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see
First one's coming by the time you count to three

One, Like a teacher you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

One, I can barely calm it down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa

Hey referee I think we're ready for round two
Stay there, I'll come to you
Just relax while I analyze your tatoos, tryna see where I'mma put my name on your back boo
Just when you thought the water park couldn't get no wetter, I'm dripping down a back, like I'm doing it in my sweater
Rise above the oven, cream on the cupcake, hazelnut flavored, haagen dazs milkshake

As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready, and you'll see
The second one's coming by the time you count to three

One, Like a teacher you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

One, I can barely calm it down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

Nobody-body is listening, let it go
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, when you sing
Somebody-body better turn on the radio
Cuz I wanna hear you sing, baby sing

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh

One, Like a teacher you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an owner
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

One, I can barely calm it down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh
That's my shhh, That's my shhh, That's my shhh

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, yeaa
