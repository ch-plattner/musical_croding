We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night 

Excuse me I dont mean to bother 
But I noticed you from a far 
And shawty I said wait 
I know you dont know me 
But tonight that could change 
Gotta be where you are, are babe 

Girl together well be losing track of time 
Baby aint no need to rush we got all night 
Seeing sparks up in this club 
By the time the sun comes up 
You gon swear youre in love 

Just meet me on the floor the time is now 
Youre looking so right, under these lights 
And girl if you get lost ignore the crowd 
The feeling can go go as long as you like 
'Cause we own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night 

Can you imagine the places we could go 
Baby Ill lead the way 
Treat you like a star, lights, camera, action 
And we can take it further whenever you say 
Just say the word 

Girl together well be losing track of time 
Baby aint no need to rush we got all night 
Seeing sparks up in this club 
By the time the sun comes up 
You gon swear that youre in love 

Just meet me on the floor the time is now 
Youre looking so right, under these lights 
And girl if you get lost ignore the crowd 
The feeling can go go as long as you like 
'Cause we own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night 

Babe wont stop wont beat the clock 
We can rock as long as we wanna, oh 
From dust till dawn the beat comes on 
We keep it going as long as we wanna, oh oh 

Just meet me on the floor the time is now 
Youre looking so right, under these lights 
And girl if you get lost ignore the crowd 
The feeling can go go as long as you like 
'Cause we own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night, night-ight-ight 
We own the night
