Before you get in bed, throw on those heels
Hey girl, now I know why you waited
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill
Ladies come and go but you got something different
Had me so addicted from the start
And I'd never known all this loving I'd be missing
If I didn't work my way into your heart

You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo
I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you
Like your birthday suit
You give me vertigo, that vertigo

The way that you please me sets this room on fire
I'm burning with desire in this bed
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
If all of this is happening in my head
Waited for so long
But what you got is different
Had me so addicted from the start
Boy, I'd never known all the shit that I was missing
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart

You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, that vertigo
I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you
Like your birthday suit
You give me vertigo, that vertigo

I'm working downtown
You all in my head
This love that we found
We'll never regret
We're empty inside
I'm filling you up with our vertigo
You waking me up
To my fantasy
Right here in this bed
We stay here all day
And my head be spinning
You do that to me with that vertigo

You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo
I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you
Like your birthday suit
You give me vertigo, vertigo

Say you give me vertigo, vertigo
Baby, oh
Vertigo, vertigo
Say you give me
Say you give me
Vertigo, that vertigo
