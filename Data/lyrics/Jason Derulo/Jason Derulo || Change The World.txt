[Verse 1]
With your eyes, with your lips
With your thighs, with your hips
The way you change me
Girl this might come in handy

Ah, with your smile, with your walk
Girl I pause when you talk
You make me peaceful
The rest of world may need you

[Hook]
Look how you got me goin'
Time with you is golden
You can save world from foldin', no

Look how you get me higher
You hold the world's desires
For truth and all the liars

[Chorus]
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)

You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)

You could change the world

[Verse 2]
With your words now I see
How the greatness in me
You make me better
Every kiss from you I treasure

If every man have you
All the wars would be through
They'll get like I get
On the streets they'll be no riot

[Hook]
Look how you got me goin'
Time with you is golden
You can save world from foldin', no

Look how you get me higher
You hold the world's desires
For truth and all the liars

[Chorus]
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)

You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)

You could change the world
