What we got is sexy
If you like it, I love it

You let me in, they told me to come back again
You into me, I'm into you, that's all that matters, it's beautiful
You're so sweet like candy, You're so sweet like candy
What we got, What we got, so so sweet like candy
And no label on it, And no label on it
What we got, What we got, let's Make It Up As We Go

Don't stop the party, it's just getting started
Make It Up As We Go, I know you want it
I'm all upon it
What we got is sexy, What we got is sexy
Baby come undress me
