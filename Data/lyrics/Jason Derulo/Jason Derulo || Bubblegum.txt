Got me 'bout to break my neck
Tell me how you pop like that
You do it like it ain't no sweat
I never seen a bubble so fat
You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
I'm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give you to me
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she don't look back
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad
I can't be mad at that baby fat
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum
If she keep blowing it might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum

Oh yeah

You do it like a professional
But you want your own schedule
Look you're so pretty in pink
Acting like a shit don't stain
You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
I'm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give you to me
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she don't look back
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad
I can't be mad at that baby fat
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum
If she keep blowing it might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum

[Tyga:]
Blow it like a bubble, Bazooka baby
Clouds on the coach, you my hookah baby
She got that senile, make a grown man crazy
(Got that senile, make a grown man crazy)
Shawty in the gym, ask Mazy
I pull up a geda, ask easy
It's too late to go back, she look back I'm cheesin'
I'm kodak, my rolex, a moment, 'der history
(Yum) Pussy bum, tik tok, eyes locked, lip-locked dang pop I'm done
T-bar, hot numb, no love hot sprung baby gimme some yum yum
Big willy, surf board (jerk board), really gonna jock, do your thang girl
And I need me a ride or die who's a freak
Got seven different girls every day of the week (what)

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she don't look back
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad
I can't be mad at that baby fat
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum
If she keep blowing it might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop popopop pop that bubblegum
