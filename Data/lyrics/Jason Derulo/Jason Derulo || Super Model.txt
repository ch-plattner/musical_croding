Slim, unforgettable 
Body, so edible 
Damn, this girl's impeccable 
She's so out of control 
She ain't even gotta say two words 
Let me take you home and I kill that girl with two stones 
And her body so put together I'll fit any type of weather 
Steppin' like she on a catwalk 
And nobody here doin' that better
And she can be my super model
And if you're living life in the fast lane 
Then let me be your Prado 
Told to hold on, baby let's ride 
I take you from the east to the west side 
She keep your zone head tied 
Jet lag or day, she fly 
Oh don't you know she can be a, be a, super model 
Oh don't you know she can be mine, be mine 
Baby, I know 
She ain't you 
The way, you want my shirt after we make love 
She ain't you 
The way you kiss my lips, baby just because 
It's just the way-ay ay 
You say my name-ay-ayme 
Or when we play-ay-ay 
It's not the same-ay-ame 
She ain't you I'm seeing you 
I know she, know she bad 
You ain't gotta tell her, no 
She ain't bifa lames 
Her swag so accapela 
Skin is frephenela 
Open up and get a taste 
Put 'em on waking up every morning
Just to go home and see that face 
Smile incredible 
Slim, unforgettable 
Body, so edible 
Damn, this girl's impeccable 
Oh, so let's be inseparable 
I only want you on my runway I found my super model 
Yeah, you go find yours one day
Oh don't you know she can be a, be a, super model 
Oh don't you know she can be mine, be mine 
Baby, I know She ain't you 
The way, you want my shirt after we make love 
She ain't you 
The way you kiss my lips, baby just because 
It's just the way-ay ay 
You say my name-ay-ayme 
Or when we play-ay-ay 
It's not the same-ay-ame 
She ain't you 
Oh don't you know she can be a, be a, super model 
Oh don't you know she can be mine, be mine 
Baby, I know 
She ain't you 
The way, you want my shirt after we make love 
She ain't you 
The way you kiss my lips, baby just because 
It's just the way-ay ay 
You say my name-ay-ayme 
Or when we play-ay-ay 
It's not the same-ay-ame 
She ain't you
