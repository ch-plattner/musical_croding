
You don't really wanna let this stuff go
But you're too stubborn to pick up the phone
I'm no better can't admit when I'm wrong
So round and round we go
I should be happy but I'm feeling so so
There's something missing and I bet you it's you
I know it
You know it
We were made for each other so

My shattered heart is on the ground
I've got to see your face right now
Just tell me where and you'll find me waiting there

Can we forget the past
I miss you I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces

I wear a smile to hide the hurt
Cause no one loves you better than your first
People say that time heals all
So why is it getting worse
I just don't wanna face this battle alone
A broken heart can only beat for so long
I know it
You know it
We were made for each other so

My shattered heart is on the ground
I've got to see your face right now
Just tell me where and you'll find me waiting there

Can we forget the past
I miss you I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces

Cutting through my soul and it's razor sharp
Now I'm scattered here in a million parts
How am I supposed to fix a broken heart
Cutting through my soul and it's razor sharp
Now I'm scattered here in a million parts
How am I supposed to fix a broken heart

Can we forget the past
I miss you I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
Pick up pick up up the pieces
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces
