It's pouring down like rain
Ain't no denying it baby
And now it's started a flame
Oh girl you got me going insane in a good way
Can't get you off of my brain
Ain't that a shame

If there's just one thing that I gotta do
Is wrap my arms around you
And hold you close and never let you go

Can I get closer
Can I get closer
Can I get closer, closer to you
Well can I wipe away your tears
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be
Can I get closer, closer to you

Now baby I've been thinking 'bout us
And I just don't understand
How God can make a woman so beautiful
So perfect, for a man

Cause when I wake up in the morning and I think about your face
No one in this world could ever take your place
God sent you to me and it's meant to be
Baby, oohh

If there's just one thing that I gotta do
Is wrap my arms around you
And hold you close
And never let you go, ohh
Can I get closer
Can I get closer
Can I get closer, closer to you

Now can I wipe away your tears
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be

Can I get closer, closer to you

And now I'm thinking to myself what is going on
Cause it's to good to be true
But then I remember there's a God up there saying
Son this ones for you

So can I get closer
Ohh can I get close to you baby
Can I get closer, closer to you (closer to you)

Now can I wipe away your tears
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be

Can I get closer, closer to you

Yeah

Thank you

Ohhhhhhhhhohhh

I just wanna get close
I just wanna get closer to you

I just wanna get close
I just wanna get close to you

I just wanna get close
Just let me get close

Closer to you, mhhhhmm

I just wanna get close
I just wanna get close to you [X2]

I just wanna get close
Just let me get close to you
