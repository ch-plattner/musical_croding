[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
Just like the rain, down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for -
I'd fight for you

Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh  eh ba bum ba eh
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh  eh ba bum ba eh
I'd fight for you

[Verse 1]
Friends are cool but we both know - they don't wanna see us together
Don't wanna lose what I live for - I'm willing to do whatever
'cause I don't wanna see you cry
Give our love another try
I bet we get it right this time
As long as you're prepared to fight

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live another day without your body next to me
I'm not gonna let them break us down
'cause baby I know now

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
I'd fight for you
Just like the rain, down in Africa
I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for -

[Verse 2]
Lesgo
What they say - It don't even matter
They don't really understand
Without each other, we are barely breathing
Let's get air in these hearts a gain
'cause I don't wanna see you cry - give our love another try
I bet we get it right this time
As long as you're prepared to fight
Prepared to fight

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live another day without your body next to me
I'm not gonna let them break us down
'cause baby I know now (know now, know now)

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
I'd fight for you
Just like the rain, down in Africa
I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for -
I'd fight for you

Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh  eh ba bum ba eh
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh  eh ba bum ba eh

If you've got someone that's worth fighting for
Don't let nobody hold you down let me hear you say
WOOOOOOAHHHHHH
If you've found someone that's worth dying for
The one you can't live without let me hear you say
WOOOOOOAHHHHHH

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
I'd fight for you
Just like the rain, down in Africa
I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting forrrrrrrr
WOAH

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
I'd fight for you
Just like the rain, down in Africa
I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for
