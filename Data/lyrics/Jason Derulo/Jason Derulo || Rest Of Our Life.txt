La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la

Crazy nights we share, bottles everywhere
Drunk but we don't care, don't care
Jeans are on the floor, Pepsi on the door
I still want you more, you more

Throw your phone away, making love for days
Baby

If I asked you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed again
Pull the sheets right over and
Kiss your body, on your favourite place
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our lives
The rest of our life

Life
La-la-la-la Life
The rest of our life (La-la-la-la Life)
La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la

Tonight I'm your tattoo, never leaving you
Never leave this room, this room
Don't you touch your hair
No makeup, I swear you're perfect everywhere

Throw your phone away, making love for days
Baby

If I asked you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed again
Pull the sheets right over and
Kiss your body, on your favourite place
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our lives
The rest of our life

Life
La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la-la Life
La-la-la

I hope you stay
Na Na
Right here with me
Na Na
I want your love
Na Na
I need your love

If I asked you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed again

If I ask you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed again
Pull the sheets right over and
Kiss your body, on your favourite place
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our lives

I hope you stay
Na Na
Right here with me
Na Na
I want your love
Na Na
I need your love
For the rest of my life

I hope you stay
Na Na
Right here with me
Na Na
I want your love
Na Na
I need your love
For the rest of my life
