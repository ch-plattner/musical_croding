I've gotta thank, gotta thank
That man that didn't know what he had (know what he had)
And I got a thing for that brain
That made you happy making him mad (making him mad)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Well he dropped a dime
I came up behind and I picked it up, picked it up
That look on his face
When he sees the way that you switched it up, switched it up

[Chorus:]
Your heart was broken back then and I was perfect revenge
You say, I just want my ex to see you
And it was okay with me, but I hope things to see
I say, I just want my ex to see you
Started as a sexy rebound, but you sleeping next to me now
You say, I just want my ex to see you
Started as a sexy rebound, now you getting the best of me now
I say, I just want my ex to see you

I wish my ex all the best
But I hope she see my with my new new (with my new new)
We'll be dancing like we're sexing
I'd be lying if I said we ain't got nothing to approve

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I upgraded, Dolce purses and them clothes, take my credit card and go
Just payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback
Upgraded, drink champagne like it's too cold, payback can be icy cold
Payback, payback, we'll call it payback, payback

[Chorus]

Slow it down on them
I just want my ex to see, to see you baby, but first
Take me from the bullshit, fly me from the pain
Somewhere between fantasy and my dreams
When I hit the bottom, you changed everything
Better believe that you saved me
Baby your angel wings, fly somewhere where there is means
Baby your angel wings, girl I just want my ex to see you
I just want my ex to see you baby
Going back, back, ain't going going back no [repeat]
