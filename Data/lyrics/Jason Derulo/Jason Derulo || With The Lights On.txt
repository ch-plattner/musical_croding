Baby, leave them on
I don't want them off
When I see them draws
Pucker, pucker, that's a no
We gonna make it grow
Pull it to the side
You say you can ride
Baby, join me in my ride

Let me hit in the front
Let me hit in the back now
To the middle of the club
Turn your back to the light now
I'm unaware, no matter where you at now
I can't wait to give you what you want

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on by
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on by
Hope you don't mind

Looking for somebody brand new
I got FCK I need you, get it?
You know what I'm tryna do
I'm like uh, she coming to, get it?

Let me hit in the front
Let me hit in the back now
To the middle of the club
Turn your back to the light now
I'm unaware, no matter where you at now
I can't wait to give you what you want
