
I like the way that your body moves all over the floor
I'd like to find a way to get lost in you
I wanna talk to you baby
Say what's on your mind
But tell me anything that you wanna do
Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight
Got a crazy feeling that I think you're just right

So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me, in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me, in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby I got what you need, you gotta try me
Try me

Talk to me

Let's go and find a place and get to know each other more
It's all over your face, I know you like what you see
I'm the one for you baby, but you can take your time
Let the music bring your body to me
Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight
Got a crazy feeling that I think you're just right

So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me, in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me, in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby I got what you need, you gotta try me
I know
I got what you need, you gotta try me

Bring that body closer
I wanna feel your skin upon mine
Like I don't really know ya
I'm grabbing that ass from behind
That's why the T.Y.
I got chills down my spine
That's why the T.Y.
Girl we might be meant to be

So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me, in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me, in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
I got what you need, you gotta try me
I got what you need, you gotta try me
