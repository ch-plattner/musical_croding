
Who's more desperate? You're on your knees boo
But when you fuck up, I don't leave you
I can't leave you, oh
Guess you're permanent, can't be removed
Each time my heart breaks, it's like a new tattoo
Don't need a new tattoo

One touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I'm still yours
What am I waiting for?

I'm running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
So don't tell me it's cool
That I'm tattooed
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me, yeah yeah

Why do we stay
When only fools would?
I guess we're both fools
'Cause the sex is good, it's way too good

Call us crazy, misunderstood
'Cause I can't leave you
And I know I should
People say I should

One touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I'm still yours
What am I waiting for?

I'm running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
So don't tell me it's cool
That I'm tattooed
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me, yeah yeah

Permanently trying to hide 
The scars we can't remove
You're drawn on me and I'm still drawn to you

I'm running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
So don't tell me it's cool
That I'm tattooed
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me, yeah yeah
