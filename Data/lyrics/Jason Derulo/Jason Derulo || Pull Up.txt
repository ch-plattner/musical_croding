
I just got a brand new whip in the yard
You can drive it when you want but you gotta keep that top down for me
I'm just tryna push this shit, don't start
Up and down your boulevard, girl I had to pull you over for the jeans

Look at that sexy body
Look at that trunk in the back
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet
Cause I never seen a girl like that

You know I had to skrr, pull up
Pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby

Girl I gotta get that Coupe for two, you'd be amazed what we could do
We can roll these windows down so they all see
Gon' and throw that thing in reverse, look back at it
Throw your hair, no body, look back at it, you gon' make somebody wanna call the police

Look at that sexy body
Look at that trunk in the back
I'mma get a lil bit ratchet
Cause I never seen a girl like that

You know I had to skrr, pull up
I had to pull up, oh yeah, skrr, I had to pull up
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby

Look at that sexy body
I never seen curves like that when we do it baby
Look at that sexy body
You know that it drives me mad
Skrr, pull up
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, take that thing like a repo
I'mma beat that thing, you my cheat code
When I'm done we gon' knock the fuck out

I had to pull up, I had to pull up, pull up
Skrr, I had to pull up up, skrr
I'mma make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby
Make you mine bu-bu-baby, make you mine bu-bu-baby
