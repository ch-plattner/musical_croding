
Yeah
Jason Derulo
Yeah

Like a shock, to my heart
When I saw you tonight
Like a dream come alive
For the very first time

When we touch, in the dark
Baby you're blowing my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time

You got it, what I won't
Give it up, shorty
Step it up, for me
and I'll give you everything
All my life, All my love
I give you my fortune and fame
I'll even give you my name

Girl you take me higher
Than I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
Fly
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Girl you take me

Up Up Up Up Up Up Up Up

Girl you take me up
Girl You take me higher
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit

When we dance, when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight
Finally mine
Yeah

Baby let's go, let's get out of here
Baby let go, got nothing to fear
And now that we're here, Let's disappear
Into the night

You got it, what I won't
Give it up, shorty
Step it up, for me
and I'll give you everything
All my life, All my love
I give you my fortune and fame
I'll even give you my name

Girl you take me higher
Than I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
Fly
The sky's The limit
The sky's The limit
Girl you take me

Up Up Up Up Up Up Up Up

Girl you take me up
Girl you take me higher
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Oh oh

Up Up. girl, you take me up
oh yeah, oh
The Sky's The Limit
The Sky's The Limit

My feet are on the ceiling
They don't wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh what I feel, I can feel it
Can you feel it (feel It, feel it)

Girl you take me higher
Than I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Girl you take me
Up Up Up Up Up Up Up Up
Girl You take me up
Girl You take me
Up Up Up Up Up
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Oh Woo
