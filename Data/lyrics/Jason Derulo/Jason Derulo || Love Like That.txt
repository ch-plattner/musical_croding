Role play, we could stop the role play, everyone left
I'm making love to his girl, but he's still my nigga
No we can't control ourselves when we on that liquor

Can't let the homie in this house cause I'm in love with his girl
What are we doing?

[Hook - Jason Derülo (K. Michelle):]
We ain't supposed to love like that
(We ain't supposed to love like that)
Why do I feel good doing something so bad?
(We ain't supposed to love like that)
We ain't supposed to love like that

[K. Michelle:]
Okay, it just hit 3:30, he ain't home yet
Okay, I might do some things that I'm gon' regret
He don't treat me right, but he';s still my nigga, some how
We can't control ourselves cause we on that liquor, right now

[K. Michelle:]
Can't let my man in his house cause I'm in love with his boy
What are we doing?

[Hook]

[Jason Derülo (K. Michelle):]
(No no, I just can't)
Nah, don't stop
(No, I don't wanna stop)
Yeah just like that
(Just go)

[Jason Derülo (K. Michelle):]
This ain't no shit that can be planned
Some people never find love, maybe we can
(Maybe we can, but I feel so guilty
But living this life without you just might kill me)
Get it how you want it, I be on it, ain't no days off
Kiss it, grab it, turn it, baby, I'ma keep my Jays on
My Jays, my Jays, my Jays, no way
(We ain't supposed to love like that, no way, no way, no way)
Why do I feel so good, doing something so bad?

We ain't supposed to love like that
But we ain't supposed to love like that
We ain't supposed to love like that
We ain't supposed to love like that

Nah we ain't supposed to fuck like that
We ain't supposed to touch like that
Damn it's too much, too much, might crack
Pressure burst pipes, baby I'ma burst back
I'ma burst back baby, I'ma burst back
We ain't supposed to love like that
