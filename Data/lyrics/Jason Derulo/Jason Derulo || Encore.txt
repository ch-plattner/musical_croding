Would ya mind girl
If I told you
Last night really blew my mind
Would ya mind girl?
No disrespect
But can we do it one more time?

Should I hit you up?
Should I just give up?
Tell me, should I just walk away?
Would ya let me in?
Should I just give in?
I need to getcha back on the stage

You're so amazing, remember the time?
Just thinkin' about ya, gives me butterflies
So open the curtains, and let me inside for more
Save the bell cause I want ya know
Baby hit me with an encore

I want some more

Baby hit me with an encore

Baby hit me with an encore

For me to touch you
I can come and press rewind
Take it right back
Rubbin' your back
Trace your body, every line

Should I lay you down?
Should we do this now?
Tell me when
Just give me a sign
Are you in or out?
Is there any doubt?
Cause I'll make this night the night of your life

You're so amazing, remember the time?
Just thinkin' about ya, gives me butterflies
So open the curtains, and let me inside for more
Save the bell cause I want ya know
Baby hit me with an encore
