
Found myself in the dark
Room all day (all day all day all day)
Hopin this silence will take this pain away
But no one else is here
To wipe my tears when they fall (oh no)
And no one hears me screaming
But these four walls
So I'm callin out your name
Hoping you'd hear me
Got both hands on my heart
Hoping you'd feel me
Cuz baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Callin out for you I cant sleep at night

Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I 
Take without is painful
Please someone help me 
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel

Now, who's gonna pick
Me up when I fell down (down)
You left with a part of me
The air is thining
It's gettin so hard to breathe
(Breathe, breathe) Breathe
I tried to take the pain
Away with this pen
But I found myself writing
Your name over again
No one can take your place (no)
Life without you is impossible
So I'm callin out your name
Hoping you'd hear me
Got both hands on my heart
Hoping you'd feel me
Cuz baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Callin out for you I cant sleep at night

Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I 
Take without is painful
Please someone help me 
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel

Yeah hmmm
Just put your hands in the air
If you're missin somebody
Come home
Cuz I cant handel this alone

Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I 
Take without is painful
Please someone help me 
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin, callin, callin for my angel
I'm callin for my angel
