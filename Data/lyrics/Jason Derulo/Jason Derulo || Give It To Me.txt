Do it, your mind, lose it
Lose it, ain’t nothing to it
Do it, you could do it!
If you’re sexy and you know it
And you ain’t afraid to show it
Got money in your pocket
And you ain’t afraid to blow it
Bottles are your favorite
And you ain’t afraid to pour it
Pour it up, up, just pour it up!

Let’s get crazy, crazy, crazy, lets get wild tonight
I will be dancing on the walls!
Let’s make it baby, baby, baby
That’s all right
Ain’t nothing wrong with that at all!

Give it to me, oh-oh!
Give it to me, oh-oh!
Give it to me, oh-oh!
Give it to me, gi-gi-gi-give it to me, oh-oh!
Give it to me, oh, oh!
Give it to me, oh, oh!
Give it to me, gi-gi-gi-give it to me!

Pump pump pump it up, pump it up,
Pump pump pump it, pump it!
T-t-turn it up, turn it up,
T-t-t-t-turn it turn it!

Hey, miss independent,
If you want it, you can get it!
Your body wanna party,
Well I think that you should let it!
Bottles are your favorite
And you ain’t afraid to pour it
Pour it up, up just pour it up!

Let’s get crazy, crazy, crazy, let’s get wild tonight
I will be dancing on the walls!
Let’s make it baby, baby, baby
That’s all right
Ain’t nothing wrong with that at all!

Lose it, lose it,
Ain’t nothing to it, to it
You could do it!
Put your back into it
Do it, do it your mind!
Lose it, lose it,
Ain’t nothing to it, to it
You could do it, do it

T-t-turn it up, up,

Take your body way up
Take your body down low!

We gonna keep this thing hot
Cause this track just too do’
Tighter than a deadlock
