
Queen of hearts.
Queen of hearts.
She the type of girl to make ya lazy.
Don't wanna do a thing.
I've been thinking crazy lately;
Like buying her a ring.
I used to be at the party with ladies, getting down.
I used to play with them girls
But, I'm thinking different now.

Oooooh she's a star;
She makes me fly.
Takin' me places, I've never seen.
Two worlds apart.
But, she don't mind,
Cause she's got her wings.

I ain't the only one in love,
Reputation is a bad girl;
Cause she the queen of hearts.
She had me open from the start,
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards.
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.

Can't wait to wake up in the morning,
Knowing she'll be around.
Heaven shoulda sent a warning;
Before sending me an angel down.
I used to chase all the money, the cars, and all them broads.
But, I don't care for them thangs ever since she stole my heart.

Oooooh she's a star;
She makes me fly.
Takin' me places, I've never seen.
Two worlds apart.
But, she don't mind,
Cause she's got her wings.

I ain't the only one in love,
Reputation is a bad girl;
Cause she the queen of hearts.
She had me open from the start,
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards.
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.

I ain't the only one in love,
Reputation is a bad girl;
Cause she the queen of hearts.
She had me open from the start,
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards.
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.
