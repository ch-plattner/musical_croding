
You can lock me up,
Throw away the key
Cause all that I could think about
Is you on top of me

I got it bad bad
Damn I want it bad
You could be my
You could be my
You could be my my my

Perfect alibi
Let no body see
But if I cant have your love baby
I don't wanna be free

I got it bad bad
Cause girl you so damn bad
You could be my
You could be my
You could be my my my

Fool this is a crime
I got a girl

But I'm good if it's you and I against the world
So you mine as well put me in silver cuffs
Cause I don't wanna be wanna be hers
Gots to be gots to be hers
Girl you have stolen my heart
Baby don't tell me your not

[Chorus]
Guilty guilty, You are the crime
Guilty guilty, So I'll do the time
Now I'm a criminal
You make me a criminal

Guilty guilty, I mean no harm
Guilty guilty, sound the alarm
Now I'm a criminal
You make me a criminal

Yeah I'm guilty, g-g-g-g-guilty

You could strip my rights
Put me in a cell
As long as were together girl,
I don't wanna make bail

Cause I want it want it
Baby your most wanted
You could be my
You could be my
You could be my my my

Bonnie on the side
I'mma play the Clyde
We could get away with one another
We'll be fine
We'll be wanted wanted
Tell me how you want it

You could be my
You could be my
You could be my my my

Fool this is a crime
I got a girl (got a girl)

But I'm good if it's you and I against the world (against the world)
So you mine as well put me in silver cuffs (silver cuffs)
Cause I don't wanna be wanna be hers
Gots to be gots to be hers
Girl you have stolen my heart
Baby don't tell me your not

[Chorus]
Guilty guilty, You are the crime
Guilty guilty, So I'll do the time
Now I'm a criminal
You make me a criminal

Guilty guilty, I mean no harm
Guilty guilty, sound the alarm
Now I'm a criminal
You make me a criminal

Yeah I'm guilty, g-g-g-g-guilty
