[Verse 1]
You are the one, who makes it worth getting up in the morning.
I'd trade the sun, for the chance to show you I'm all in.
We could be like Jay and Beyonce,
Bonnie and Clyde us like a movie, take that chance on love yeah.

[B Section]
Now I can't predict what the future holds,
But I'll fight forever to keep you close yeah.

[Chorus]
I'd give it all up baby,
Trade in the world to show I'm fallin, I'm fallin yeah.
Don't need the fame or money, long as I got you girl
I'm fallin I'm fallin
Tell all them other girls I've fallin, oh.

[Verse 2]
Put me to the test, I'll prove to you I'll never be a heartache.
Cause you're the best, you deserve the best.
Rule this world like Michelle and Barack, be my girl we'll end up on top.
Take that chance on love yeah.

[B Section]
Now I can't predict what the future holds,
But I'll fight forever to keep you close yeah.

[Chorus]
I'd give it all up baby,
Trade in the world to show I'm fallin, I'm fallin yeah.
Don't need the fame or money, long as I got you girl
I'm fallin I'm fallin
Tell all them other girls I've fallin, oh.

[Bridge]
Oh I want the world to see, so I regulate some jewelry,
To show you I'm not ashamed I'm fallin, fallin, yea.
I'm telling all them other girls, and everybody around the world,
I told you girl I'm not ashamed I'm fallin, fallin, yea.
I'll give it all up baby, trade in the world to show I'm fallin,
I'm fallin yeah.

[Chorus]
I'd give it all up baby,
Trade in the world to show I'm fallin, I'm fallin yeah.
Don't need the fame or money, long as I got you girl

Tell all them other girls I've fallin, oh.
