Kissin' noww
We could have the time of our lives
I'll pretend we're more than friends
Hold you close, just for tonighhhtt

And even though we're not in looovve
Time with you was just enough
Now that we're donee, it was fuun
But chu got me singin' like
Ooohhh iiitss aa teemporraarry lovve, loovve
(still got me open, just give me one motion)
Ooohhh iiitss aa teemporraarry lovve, loovve
(lets do sumthin crazy,we're livin the moment)
No no, temporary love
No no, temporary, I cant seem to get in lovee
Im goin' temporary love

Ohh we, supposed to be, not as fun
The tiime beginn
Suuuddenlyyy, whooo would thiink
That one day I got feelllinggss

And even though we're not in looovve
Time with you was just enough
Now that we're donee, it was fuun
But chu got me singin' like
Ooohhh iiitss aa teemporraarry lovve, loovve
(still got me open, just give me one motion)
Ooohhh iiitss aa teemporraarry lovve, loovve
(lets do sumthin crazy,we're livin the moment)
