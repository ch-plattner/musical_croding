Girl you've been good to me for so long 
And I know what I did was wrong 
But this time, this time, this time, I'ma change 
I wont lie to you no more 
I know you heard this song before 
But this time,this time, this this time,is not the same 

Take a, take a, take a, another chance 
I know I don't deserve to have your love ever again 
But I need you baby yeahhh... 
How can I make it, make it, make it up to you 
Your wish is my command give me your hand and I'll do 
Cuz it hurts me when you say, 

I sound like a broken record, record, record 
A broken record, record, record 
All the times I said I was gonna change 
I'ma sound like a broken record 
A broken record, record, record 
Every time I lie, your ears bleed with pain 
Form the sounds of a broken record 

I didn't know what I had till you left 
Since you've been gone my life's been a mess 
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry I'm too blame 
The times you took me back, it got worse 
Wish I could take back all the hurt 
I'm sorry, sorry, so sorry, I'm ashamed. 

Please, take a, take a, take another chance 
I know I don't deserve to have your love ever again 
But I need you baby, yeahhh... 
How can I make it, make it, make it up to you 
Your wish is my command give me your hand and I'll do 
Cuz it hurts me when you say, 

I sound like a broken record, record, record 
A broken record, record, record 
All the times I said I was gonna change 
I'ma sound like a broken record 
A broken record, record, record 
Every time I lie, your ears bleed with pain 
Form the sounds of a broken record
