Come on.

Everybody's looking for love. Oh. Oh.
Ain't that the reason you're at this club. Oh. Oh.
You ain't gonna find a dance with him. No. Oh.
Got a better solution for you girl. Oh. Oh.

Just stay with me now. Say the word and we'll go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You'll be screaming no.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head. Yeah. In my head. Oh yeah.

Some dudes know all the right things to say.
When it comes down to it, it's just a game.
Instead of talking let me demonstrate. Yeah.
Get down to business let's skip foreplay.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You'll be screaming no.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head.

Break it down. Ay-oh. Come on. Ay-oh. Ay-oh.
You singing to me baby in my head right now. Ay-oh. Ay-oh. Come on.
She'll be screaming out when it all goes down.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and well go. We can go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You'll be screaming no.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head, it's going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You'll be screaming more.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head, it's going down.
In my head.

[Nicki Minaj]
Astronomical, animated, so comical
His fantasy takes us to Monacco
All up in his head, like a folicle
Bite me, your money's short, 5 feet
Put me in a ward, psyche
Smash more clubs than Tiger Wood's wifey
I am the bitch
Watch the bitches that feed my gritz
Hit up j.r. and tell him to call jason
Do a pop song and stack my caucasians
Now let's head off to Bejing
Kiss kiss
Now I'm headed up of in his daydreams
Here I go, go
Here I go
