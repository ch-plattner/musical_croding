
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer (yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we’ll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, “We’re going all the way.”

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain’t friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We’ll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect (yeah)
But we won’t know unless we try (try)
I know you’re nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we’ll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, “We’re going all the way.”

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain’t friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We’ll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

(Whoa)

Kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

Tonight we’ll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, “We’re going all the way.”

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (yes, we do, yeah)
Just take me to the other side (take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain’t friends anymore (oh, no)
If we walk down this road
We’ll be lovers for sure
So tonight (so tonight) kiss me like it’s do or die (kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

(Whoa)
Take me to the other side
(Whoa)
And take me to the other side
(Whoa)
Kiss me like it’s do or die
(Whoa)
And take me to the other side
