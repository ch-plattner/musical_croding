Electra

Its burning thru my veins
Electrified me but I love the pain
My wire is on fire babe
And I cool down if youre not close to me

Your touch is like a shockwave
And I'm addicted
Yeah opposites attract me
I love to visit, visit, visit
We in the dark cause my fuse is blown
My lights are off, off
Girl you turn me on

We makin love to the music
We takin it slow
Youre makin me lose it
Youre shockin my soul.
Baby youre perfect
Cant believe that your mine

My curcuits blown can you come back to the room
Turn me on baby I'm waitin on you
To come come closer, examine this view.

That sexy energy
Keeps comin at a great velocity
That sexy energy
Has got me feelin like I never wanna leave

Your bodies so exotic
I wanna tell the world about it
Put the plug in the socket
If your really about it bout it
Were in the dark cause my fuse is blown
My lights are off , 
But girl you turn me on

We makin love to the music
We takin it slow
Youre makin me lose it
Youre shockin my soul.
Baby youre perfect
Cant believe that your mine
Baby youve got it
