I start to lose my senses
Yeah.
When I’m wide awake
Seeing things straight
You’re a love I gotta lose
Even though you never change
You'll stay the same
I keep on waking up to you
And I don’t know why
Cause I know you’re gonna make me cry
And I don’t know how,
but you do it to me every time

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzing
uncast your spell?
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizing

You got me sleep walking
You got me sleep walking
You got me…
Odd it seems
You’re in every dream
There’s nowhere I can get away
And you stole from me, My sanity
But I never seem to make an escape
But why
When I know you’re gonna make me cry
And I don’t know how
But you do it to me every time

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzing
uncast your spell?
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizing

You got me sleep walking [4x]
You got me…

Can’t wait for the sunrise
To wake up and open my eyes
Somebody pinch me
So I can erase the
Spell she has on my life
Jay snap out the sleeping
Sip on some coffee
We’re leaving
But her love will always
Keep you asleep

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzing
uncast your spell?
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizing

You got me sleep walking [4x]
You got me…
