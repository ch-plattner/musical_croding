
Ooh...know I  feel so strange looking out the door 
oooh...tryin hard to change but can't let go 
oooh...cryin' tears of pain and more and more 
oooh...everyday is the same as the one before 

I'm walkin the floor over you 
I'm walkin the floor 

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold 
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul

Ooh...Is it long to wait, is it much to pay? 
oooh...Sometimes it's hard waiting for the day.

you know it's hard. I said it's hard 
You know it's true. I said it's hard 
you know it's hard. You know it's true 

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed ?-?-?
In the eye of the night  ?-?-?
In the day everything ?-?-?
She was smilin' a tear at her waters fall ?? 

you know it's true. You know it's true now 

I'm walkin the floor over you 
I'm walkin' the floor 
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Does it matter now? [repeat]
