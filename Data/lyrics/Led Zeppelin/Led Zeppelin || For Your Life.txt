
You said I was the only, With my lemon in your hand 
Exhibition is your habit, Emotion second hand. 
Had to pull away to save me, Maybe next time around 
And she said, 'don't you want it? 
Don't you want cocaine-cocaine-cocaine 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah.

Heard a cry for mercy, In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned. Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground.  Oh, hello underground.
Wine and roses ain't quite over, fate deals a losing hand
And I said: didn't mean to... did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 

You wanna do it, you wanna 
You wanna do it when you wanna 
You wanna do it, do it when you wanna 

When you blow it, babe, You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama, Baby, fake with all your might 
When you fake it, mama, Please fake it right  (for yourself babe)

When you fake it baby,
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life, for your life, for your life 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 
Do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 

Oh, I can have you, baby, But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby, nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal, Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow.

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please. 
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to, Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it, I over-ran it, (fryin) 
For your life, For your life.
