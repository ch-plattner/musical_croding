If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break.
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break.
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay.

I worked on the levee, mama goin' night and day.
I worked on the levee, mama goin' night and day.
Never worked so hard, levee's wonderin' away.
Oh no, oh no. Oh no, oh no.

Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan.
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan.
It's got what it takes, gotta leave his home.

Crying won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good.
Crying won't help you, mama prayin' won't do you no good.
When the levee breaks, baby you've gotta move, gotta move now.

Keep on cryin', keep on truckin' along.
Keep on grindin', keep on truckin' along.
Been diggin' thousand years, like she never ever comin' home, oh well now.

Goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home.
