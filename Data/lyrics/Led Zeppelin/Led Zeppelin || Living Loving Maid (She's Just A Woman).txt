
With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat, 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 

[Chorus]
Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round, 
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down. 

Alimony, alimony payin' your bills, 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 

[Chorus]

Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 
With the butler and the maid and the servants three. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 

Nobody hears a single word you say. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day. 
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 

[Chorus]

Livin', Lovin', She's just a woman.
