I was burned in the heat of the moment, 
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day 
When I learned how my time had been wasted, 
(And a) tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder, 
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older 
I've got friends who will give me fuck all 

(On the) corner of Bleeker and nowhere 
In the land of not quite day 
A shiver runs down my backbone 
Face in the mirror turns grey

So (I) looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman 
To my surprise he'd melted away. 

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay 
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward. 

Lost on the path to attainment 
Search in the eyes of the wise 
When I bled from the heart of the matter 
I started bleeding without a disguise 

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause 
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around 
Or you'll land in a boat without oars 
Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I lost my way. 

Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I don't know where I'm gonna find it. 

Hey babe, Hey babe, 
Do you wanna know, 
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah? 

Let me tell you now, babe 
Let me tell you 
That it feels so good that it must be right 

Now my babe, 
Let me tell you 
That it feels so good that it must be right...
