
It was an April morning when they told us we should go 
As I turn to you, you smiled at me 
How could we say no? 

With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had 
Oh, the songs to sing, when we at last return again 

Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know 
Below the streets that steam and hiss, 
The devil's in his hole 

Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days 
Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen. 

Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown 
The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground 

Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din 
Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd 

To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds 
With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone 

If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king 
So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet. 

Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow 
As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow 

Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain 
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again 

Wandering & wandering, What place to rest the search 
The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 

The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 
From the earth... 

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way [X2]

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth.
