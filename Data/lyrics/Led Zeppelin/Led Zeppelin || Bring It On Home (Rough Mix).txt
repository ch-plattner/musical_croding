All you pretty women, sittin' out all night long,
I gotta tell you baby, you gonna seduce me all night long,
Bring it on home, bring it on home, bring it on home.

Keep on messin' me baby, keep messin' me around,
Come home with the mornin' sun, boogie all night,
Bring it on home, bring it on home, ooh bring it on home.
Alright.

I don't care sweet baby, what your money's sayin',
I'm gonna give you sweet lovin' cryin' your gonna, boogie night and day,
Bring it on home, bring it on home, bring it on home, bring it on home.
Home, home, home, home, home, ooh yeah.
You got it, you got it.
