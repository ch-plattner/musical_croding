She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid" 

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark 
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark 

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side 
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah 
I know my baby, Lord, I said, "is really sloppy drunk" 
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum 

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home 
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone 
See my baby, Tell hurry on home 
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone 

Hey, she promises, She's my rider 
I wanna tell you, She's my rider 
I know you're mine, She's my rider 
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider 

I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side 
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied 
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in 
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 

She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time 

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg 

Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about 

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl 
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed 

She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brownskin sugar plum...
