Oh twenty-four hours, Baby sometimes seem to slip into days 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way 
Sittin, lookin at the clock, time moves so slow 
I've been watchin for the hands to move 
Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes seems to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this way. 

To sing a song for you, I recall you used to say 
"Oh baby this one's for we two", Which in the end is you anyway 

How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way. 

There was a time that I stood tall, In the eyes of other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman, And now I can't get back again 

How come twenty-four hours, sometimes slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this way 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
When I feel this way...I feel this way
