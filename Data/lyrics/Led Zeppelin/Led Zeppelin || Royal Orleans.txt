
One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite 
Feel it bite. 

A man I know, went down to Louisiana, 
had himself a bad, bad fight 
And when the sun peeked through 
John Cameron with Suzanna,
He kissed the whiskers, left & right 
Whiskers! 

Now, now, now, fright subsides 
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set the room alight.
Whiskers! 

Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right 
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night 
Most everywhere, Until the closet's bare 
Run for the razor, Doin' up my hair 

New Orleans queens, Sure know how to schmooze it 
Maybe for some that seems alright 
When I step out, strut down with my sugar 
She'd best not talk like Barry White! 

One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite 
Feel it bite.
