
Oh she's my baby, Let me tell you why 
Hey, she drives me crazy, She's the apple of my eye 
'Cause she is my girl, And she can never do wrong 
If I dream too much at night, Somebody please bring me down 

Hey, I love that little lady, I got to be her fool 
Ain't no other like my baby, I can break the golden rule 
'Cause I get down on my knees, Oh, I pray that love won't die 
And if I always try to please, I don't know the reason why, yeah 

If she would come back, Only stay with me 

Every little bit of my love, etc., I give to you girl 

I don't have to go by plane 
I ain't gotta go by car 
I don't care just where my darling is 
People I just don't care how far 
I'm gonna crawl 
I don't care if I got to go back home 
I don't care what I got to stand to her back 
I'm gonna crawl 
I'm gonna move the car, baby 
She give me good lovin 
Yes I love her, I guess I love her 
I'm gonna crawl.
