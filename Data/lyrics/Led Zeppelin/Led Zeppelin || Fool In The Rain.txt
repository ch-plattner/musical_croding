Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining 
Like a star that can't wait for the night 
I hate to think I've been blinded baby 
Why can't I see you tonight? 

And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' 
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright 
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning 
Why don't you show up, make it all right? 
Yeah, it's all right. 

And if you promised you'd love so completely 
and you said you would always be true 
You swore that you would never leave me, baby: 
What ever happened to you? 

And you thought it was only in movies 
As you wish all your dreams would come true 
It ain't the first time believe me, baby 
I'm standin here feeling blue 
Yeah I'm blue 

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner 
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown 
Another ten minutes no longer 
And then I'm turning around 

The clock on the wall's moving slower 
My heart it sinks to the ground 
And the storm that I thought would blow over 
Clouds the light of the love that I found 

Now my body is starting to quiver 
And the palms of my hands getting wet 
I've got no reason to doubt you baby, 
It's all a terrible mess 

I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless 
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey 
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless 
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah 
Light of the love that I found...
