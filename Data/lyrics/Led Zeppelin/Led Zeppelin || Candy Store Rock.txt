Well... Oh baby baby. Don't you want a man like me? 
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be 
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes, of blue 
Oh baby baby, It's more than anybody else could do 

Well... Oh baby baby. You know when I see you walkin down the street 
Oh baby baby, Well you lookin good enough to eat 
Oh baby baby, I dont believe I've tasted this before 
Oh baby baby, I want it now 
And every mouthfull more of you. 

Talk about you, Yeah. 

Oh baby baby, You know that I wanted it more 
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store 
Oh baby baby, It ain't the wrapping that sells the goods 
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you. 

Ooh baby oh baby its alright, its alright 
Ohh baby its alright...its alright 

Well, oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand, baby it's alright 

Oh baby it's alright, oh it's alright 
It's alright... [repeat]
