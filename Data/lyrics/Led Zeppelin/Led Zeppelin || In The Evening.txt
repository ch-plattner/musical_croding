
In the evening, When the day is done 
I'm looking for a woman, but the girl don't come 
So don't let her, Play you for a fool 
She don't show no pity baby, she don't make no rules 

[Chorus:] Oh, oh, I need your love, I need your love 
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have 

So don't you let her, Oh, get under your skin 
It's only bad luck and trouble, From the day that you begin 
I hear you crying in the darkness, Don't ask nobody's help 
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby, Cause you can only blame yourself 

[Chorus]

Oh it's simple, All the pain that you go through 
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, Cause that's all that's left to you 
It's lonely at the bottom, Man, it's dizzy at the top 
But if you're standing in the middle, Ain't no way you're gonna stop 

[Chorus]

Oh whatever that your days may bring 
No use hiding in a corner, Cause that won't change a thing 
If you're dancing in the doldrums, One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop 
When you're the master of the off-chance, When you don't expect a lot 

[Chorus]
