
Hear my baby comin' down the track 
Betcha my baby's comin' back 
Someday she'll get back to me 
We're gonna raise a family 

We're gonna groove, Yeah groove 
Yeah we're gonna groove 

We're gonna love... until the break of day 

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be 
You don't know whatcha do to me 
Let me say you're my one desire 
You just set my soul on fire 

Oh we're gonna groove,Yeah groove 
Yeah we're gonna groove 
We gonna love... until the break of day 

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be 
Lemme tell ya you don't know whatcha do to me 
You just set my soul on fire 
Woman you know you're my one desire... 

We gonna groove... [repeat]
