
I hear ya knock on my door 
I ain't been saving this scene for ya honey 
Don't wantcha ringin my bell 
It's too late for you to be my honey 

ooh, it's my love 
ooh, it's my own true love [X2]

Don't want you wasting my time 
Tired of ya doing the things that you do 
It's no use standing in line 
Follow the line, you better follow queue 

I say, ooooh, it's my love 
oooh, it's my own true love [X2]

I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah. But I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away 
I save a lifetime forever
But you know, you know, you know what I say 

And I say Ooh, it's my love 
Oooh, it's my own true love [repeat]
