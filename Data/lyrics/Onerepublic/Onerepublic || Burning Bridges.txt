You and I were meant to be, ain't no doubt about it no way to hide that sort of thing
Now I'm waiting for something better ain't nothing better worth imagining
I, I keep on running I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart you stole it away
Now I'll never sing the road that I could take

Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on Fire. You set me, set me on fire
You can burn my bridges down
Send this out to sea, send it where you wanted you can take your no for no or not at all
There's no filling up your spaces with fictionary places imaginary faces they don't work at all

I, I keep on running. I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart you stole it away
Now I'll never sing the road that I could take
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on Fire. You set me, set me on fire
Girl you burnt my bridges down

I want you to burn my bridges down, down
I want you to burn my bridges down

Set me on fire. You set me
Set me on Fire [x2]
I want you to burn my bridges down

I said, I want you to burn my bridges down down, down
Set me on fire [x2]
