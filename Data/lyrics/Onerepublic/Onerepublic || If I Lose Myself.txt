I stared up at the sun,
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved.
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me.

You can feel the light start to tremble,
Washing what you know out to sea.
You can see your life out of the window tonight.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be by your side.
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be you and I.
Lose myself tonight...

[Instrumental break]

I woke up with the sun,
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved.
I woke up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me.

You can feel the light start to tremble,
Washing what you know out to sea.
You can see your life out of the window tonight.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be by your side.
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be you and I.
Lose myself tonight...
Whoooooooooo

[Instrumental] (Whoooooooooo)

Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.

(Lose myself)
If I lose myself tonight...

Whoooooooooo
Whoooooo, whoooo,
Whooooooo

Whoooooooooo
Whoooooo, whoooo,
Whooooooo
