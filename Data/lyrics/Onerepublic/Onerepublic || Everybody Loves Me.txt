
Well, hell sees her shadow in my backseat
And her friends are standing right in front of me
World wide from the Cimmaron to Turkey,
Open up said, "Everybody loves me!"

And you don't have to make a sound
'Cause they got what you need (what you need)
Oh oh oh oh

Got love for the people that have warned you
God love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Late calls with the lovers that'll hate you

And you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need
What you need
Make ya say

Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down,
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

Well, I play the music don't stop till I turn gray
Stars forever like Don Suzan never fade,
He had a beautiful child, named her Desiree
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made

'Cause you don't have to make a sound
When They got what you need
Make ya say

Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me, everybody
Head down,
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody
Everybody
Oh
Everybody
Everybody

Don't need my health
Got my name and got my wealth I
Stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself I
Lose track of time
So I might be past my prime
But
I'm feeling oh so good
YEAH!

Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Get down,
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me!
Oh I said
Everybody
Everybody
Don't you know you wanna
I said Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Whoa!
