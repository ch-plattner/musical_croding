
Push & pull me closer 
Habit forming, you should stay far away 

Colored caffeine, magic 
Lights my night I'm aware of my face, too late 

After all is said and done, 
I am not the one, 
I am not the one. 

After all is said and done, 
You are still the one, 
You are still the one. 

(oohhh) 

Perfect measured pieces, 
Fit together you and i, 
Hey bright eyes. 

Dont deny my weakness, 
Your the jaded, 
Im the strength right behind you 
Behind you 

After all is said and done, 
I am not the one, 
I am not the one. 

After all is said and done, 
You are still the one, 
You are still the one. 

(oooh, ooh) 
(whoaaa-a-a-a, oohh, ohh oh oh) 

After all is said and done, 
I am not the one, 
I am not the one. 

After all is said and done, 
You are still the one, 
You are still the one. 

(oohhh, oh oh oh. oooo, ooooo) 

(oohhh, oh oh oh.. ooo, ooo)
