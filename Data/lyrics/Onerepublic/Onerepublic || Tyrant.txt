Walking on water seems perilous now you got my trust and it feels, and it feels like sabotage when I'm pulling triggers back on myself you know it is all I know, it's all I know

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out
From the out tyrant
Tyrant

Feel capable of most anything this crippled bears gonna sing gonna bring you all the answers quick turn around look your shadows could could not beautiful lies for you is what they do ..

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out
From the out
From the out tyrant

I'll stay with apathy I'm blind but I can see the tyrant to the bones
I'll stay with apathy I'm blind but I can see

Don't justify me
Don't justify me
Don't justify me

Don't justify me
Don't justify me
Don't justify me

No nononononon

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out
From the out
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out
From the out
From the out
Tyrant tyrant
