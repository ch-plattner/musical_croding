
You say you’re a minute from the deep end 
They cut cold the courtesy, its sink or swim now 
And your body’s aching for a breath, I’ll give it to ya 
With a trapt door to take care of all of them 

Come away, come away now 
You won’t stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause you’re too close for me to call 

I’ve seen the foolish shame the wise 
You just kept quiet with his own surprises 
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all 
And you’re not a foolish one at all 

Come away, come away now 
You won’t stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause you’re too close for me to call 

Lost to found, do you know 
You’re the victim of… 

Kick-slide your pose, let it go 
You don’t need them 
Only flesh, blood, and bones 

We’re the same, you and I 
Far too young to die 

Come away, come away now 
You won’t stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause you’re too close for me to call
