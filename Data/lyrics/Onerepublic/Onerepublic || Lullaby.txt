Days feel harder, night grows longer
Summer says its goodbyes
Darkness covers, we find shelter
Our own place to hide

Oh as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels on the run
Oh as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting and you hear a lullaby
Lullaby
You and I

Trees touch windows say their hellos
Hear this house as it settles in
Worry slips away it don't know your name
It don't know where to find us

Oh as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels on the run
Oh as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting and you hear a lullaby
A lullaby
You and I, you and I
