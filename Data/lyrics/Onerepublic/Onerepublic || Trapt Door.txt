You say you’re a minute from the deep end 
You cut cold the courtesy its sink or swim now
Your body’s aching for a breath I’ll give it to you 
With a trapt door to take in of all of this 

Come away come away now
You won’t stand from a fall
Hear me say it 
Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

I’ve seen the foolish shame the ways 
You just kept crying with his own surprises
And Your Trojan horses is big enough to save them all 
And you’re not a foolish one at all 

Come away come away now
You won’t stand from a fall 
Can you hear me say it 

Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

Yes you’re too close 

Lost the feeling you know 
You’re the victim of 
Kick start the clothes let it go 
You don’t need them
Only flesh blood and ghouls I’m the same old guy 

If I were to know today 

Come away come away now
You won’t stand from the fall
Hear me say it 
Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

Come away
