
Come, come, my dear 
Take flight, come near 
I see your fear creeping around you 
First love, then hate, then love, no, wait 
Your confusion, it’s gonna  kill me 
I broke for you, I woke for you
You taught me through, God love you,
I see the signs are out of line
No fault of mine 
Except for don’t say his name now 

I’m breaking out, something ain’t right here 
You’re falling out something ain’t here 

The scream, I burn 
What’s that, you say
Your cloud it’s telling you lies now 
You hear my voice,
You make some noise 
You stole my choice
It’s over now 
Pray for him now 
I speak to you

I’m breaking out, something ain’t right here
You’re falling out, something ain’t right here
I’m breaking out, something ain’t right here
You’re falling out, falling out from, falling out, you’re falling out
Why can’t you see it?

Oooooooooh

I’ll pray for you now 
I’m speaking to you
