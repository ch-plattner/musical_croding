
I do my best
To find some kind of glow
I'm giving it some heart and soul, now
From the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Yeah, we see that fire
From the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on now
The kaleidoscope claims another

Oh oh oh oh (oh)
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break

Oh oh oh oh (oh)
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race, no
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color

Well you've seen my worst
And yet you see some hope in me
The black and white set us free
Like the queen to the rook
Your decision was a sure thing
Honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel
Like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us
We all know

Oh oh oh oh (oh)
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break

Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race anymore
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color

Oh, Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break

Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race anymore
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color, hey
This is life in color, yeah
