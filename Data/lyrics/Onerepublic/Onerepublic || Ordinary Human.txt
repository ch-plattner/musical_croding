
Today I took a walk in the clouds
Today I took a walk in the clouds
Used to keep my eyes wide shut
But now I'm staring down

Today I felt a switch in my vein
Today I felt a switch in my vein
Used to be a shadow
Now a shadow scream my name
And in the daylight I could swear
We’re the same
But I’m just an ordinary human
(Ordinary ways)
I’m just an ordinary human
But I don’t feel so ordinary today
I’m just a picture perfect nothing
Sometimes I medicate
I’ll be a picture perfect human
Before the sun goes down today

Today I felt a switch in my vein
Today I made them all afraid
Used to be a shadow
Now a shadow scream my name
And in the daylight I could swear
We’re the same
But I’m just an ordinary human
(Ordinary ways)
I’m just an ordinary human
But I don’t feel so ordinary today
I’m just a picture perfect nothing
Sometimes I medicate
I’ll be a picture perfect human
Before the sun goes down today

Just an ordinary human
But I don't feel so typical today

There'll be peace in the city tonight
Peace in the city tonight
But when I'm gone
I hope they get it right
There'll be peace in the city tonight
Peace in the city tonight
For when I'm gone
I hope they get it right

Just an ordinary human
(Ordinary ways)
I'm ordinary human
I don't feel so ordinary today

But when I'm gone
I hope they get it right
