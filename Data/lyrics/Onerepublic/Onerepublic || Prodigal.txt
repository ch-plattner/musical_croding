
We say good-bye 
I turn my back 
Run away, run away 
So predictable 
Not far from here 
You see me crack 
Like a bone, like a bone 
I'm so breakable 

And I take everything from you 
But you'll take anything 
Won't you? 

Run away, run away 
Like a prodigal 
Don't you wait for me 
Don't you wait for me 
So ashamed, so ashamed 
But I need you so 
And you wait for me 
And you wait for me 

I'm on the road 
To who knows where? 
Look ahead, not behind 
I keep saying 
There's no place to go 
Where you're not there 
On your rope, I hold tight 
But it's freeing 

And I take everything from you 
But you'll take anything 
Won't you? 

Run away, run away 
Like a prodigal 
Don't you wait for me 
Don't you wait for me 
So ashamed, so ashamed 
But I need you so 
And you wait for me 
And you wait for me 

Everybody wants to be right
But only if it's not day light? 
I keep trying to find my way back 
My way back 

Run away, run away 
Like a prodigal 
Don't you wait for me 
Don't you wait for me 
So ashamed, so ashamed 
But I need you so 
And you wait for me 
And you wait for me 

Runaway 
Runaway 
Runaway 
From you 
From you 
From you
