
Oh I tried to get to you 
Pushed in the end to break me through 
I tried with all I had 
You left me standing empty handed 

Well times has passed 
Nothing ever lasts 

So now you confess that you need me 
And now you release what you're feeling 
But how is this suppose to ever be the same 

Oh it's a shame 
It's a shame [X2]
Yeaa 

You got the best of me 
Got me a reason 
Got me on my knees yea 
My love I lost my pride 
Searching for something I couldn't find 

Well time apart has brought a change of heart 

And now you confess that you need me 
And now you release what you're feeling 
But how is this suppose to ever be the same 

Oh it's a shame 
It's a shame [X2]
Yeaa 

You got the best of me 
I said love got the best of me 
Saying you got the best of me 
And I'm afraid it will never be the same 

Oh it's a shame 
It's a shame [X4]
