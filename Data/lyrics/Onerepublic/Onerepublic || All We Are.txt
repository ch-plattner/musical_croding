I tried to paint you a picture, the colors were all wrong
Black and white didn't fit you and all along,
You were shaded with patience, your strokes of everything
That I need just to make it, but I can see that...

Lord knows I failed you time and again,
But you and me are alright

We won't say our goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change

All we are, all we are is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi, yeah.

I walked a minute in your shoes –
They never would've fit
I figured there's nothing to lose.
I need to get
Some perspective on these words before I write them down
You're an island and my ship has run aground.

Lord knows I'll fail you time and again,
But you and me are alright, yeah.

We won't say our goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change

All we are, all we are is everything that's right
All we need all we need, a lover's alibi

Every single day that I can breathe,
You change my philosophy
I'm never gonna let you pass me by

So don't say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change, yeah, ooh, ooh.

So don't say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change.

All we are, all we are is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi, yeah, ooh, ooh.

So don't say our goodbyes
You know it's better...
We won't break, we won't die

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-whoa, ahh, ahh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Won’t die, won’t die this time
Won’t die, won’t die, oh…)
