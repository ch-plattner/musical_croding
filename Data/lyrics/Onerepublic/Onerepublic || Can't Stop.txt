
I guess this is what it's supposed to feel like
No, we don't talk, no, we don't talk, we don't talk anymore.
I guess this is what it's supposed to sound like
The universe, the universe, universe is torn.

I don't want to live without you
I can't live without you half the day, hey hey
I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day, hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeah

[Chorus:]
But I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop, no, thinking about, thinking about this anymore, oh, oh
And all I've got, uh, is nothing I want anymore, oh, oh

No I never get used to silence
But I don't hear, no, I don't hear, I don't hear you anymore.
I know I had to look hard to find it
Everything, everything, everything is gone.

I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day, hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeah

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop, no, thinking about, thinking about this anymore, oh, oh
And all I've got, uh, is nothing I want anymore, oh, oh

I can see stars, I can see our lights,
And I swear that they're shining here
I can see stars, I can see lights shining here.

[Chorus:]
I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop thinking about, thinking about us anymore, oh, oh
I said I can't stop thinking about, thinking about this anymore, oh, oh
And all I've got, uh, is nothing I want anymore, oh, oh

Uh uh uh uh.
