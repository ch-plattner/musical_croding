I'mma start with this
Just a single thought followed by words
I hope I don't miss
Miss anything
Write you a letter
But it's better that you hear me

I suppose I could sing
Write a song to share the meaning
Of the love for you I'm feeling
People saying what they will
I don't care

I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices calling out
What would they say
What would it change
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices making sound
What would they take
What would they say to me
If I was, If I was listening

Catch my twenty-two
I'd gladly give it to somebody
Cause I only wanna be with you
I'm lost in your love
I start to drown and you go and pull me up
Don't you listen to what they say

I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices calling out
What would they say (To me)
What would it change (Nothing)
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices making sounds
What would they take? (From me)
What would they say if I was listening?

Oh come here
There's something I should tell
Now don't fear
Cause I am going no where
Voices all around
I'm hearing voices
What would they say?
What would they say?
I'm hearing voices
Voices
Voices all around
I'm hearing voices all around
