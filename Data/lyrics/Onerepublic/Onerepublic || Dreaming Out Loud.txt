[Verse 1:]
Well hello sir, we look for Monday,
Confident we'll get there someday,
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man,
Might I say, a beautiful tie you wear,
And how do you find such lovely polka dots and stripes these days?

[Bridge:]
Break all my thoughts hit the floor,
Like I'm makin' the score,
I'm the king of the world,
I'm a popular man
Count by zeros to ten,
If you can't, well I can,
Don't let any one wake me

[Chorus:]
I'm dreamin' out loud,
Dreamin' out loud,
And all at once it's so familiar to see,
I'm dreamin' out loud,
Dreamin' out loud,
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece of apart of me

[Verse 2:]
Curtain calls a sanctuary,
Actors in the cloth, they freak me out,
Mockin' my purpose, in the magazines,
Famous how they make you feel grand,
They're always there to hold your hand,
In times of trouble, they're best of friends

[Bridge:]
Break all my thoughts hit the floor,
Like I"m makin' the score,
I'm the king of the world,
I'm a popular man
Count by zeros to ten,
If you can't, well I can,
Don't let any one wake me

[Chorus:]
I'm dreamin' out loud,
Dreamin' out loud,
And all at once it's so familiar to see,
I'm dreamin' out loud,
Dreamin' out loud,
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece apart of me

[Bridge:]
They don't care what you say
They don't care what you think
All they care, what you do,
Long as your off beat,
Take a look at yourself

Storm tries to come and wreck my world,
No I won't let it
Stumble to escape, through anchored drapes, made of bedding

[Chorus:]
I'm dreamin' out loud,
Dreamin' out loud,
And all at once it's so familiar to see,
I'm dreamin out loud,
Dreamin out loud,
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece
I'm dreamin out loud, out loud,
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece of apart of me

Well hello sir we look for Mondays
