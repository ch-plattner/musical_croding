
I saw your face, stuck in a crowd 
Silently screaming out loud 
I felt the beat echo your heart 
Throw me a line cuz its too far 

All that you want, all that you see 
All that you thought that you believe 

Is it enough? Do you think its too much? 
You say you only trust what you can touch 

All you got to do is reach out for it 

All that you want 
Is standing right in front of you 
All that you need 
Is love.... 
All that you want 
Is standing right in front of you 
All that you need 
Is love... 

Up to the ledge, put out my hands 
Get to the bones of where i'd land 
Trade in my fears, trade in my thoughts 
They disappear behind your walls 

All that I want, all that I need 
All that I thought I believed 
Was it enough? Sure not too much? 
Now youre the only thing that I can trust 

All I got to do is reaach out for it 

All that you want 
Is standing right in front of you 
All that you need 
Is love.... 
All that you want 
Is standing right in front of you 
All that you need 
Is love... 

[Instrumental]

Its all for you... 
Its all for you...
