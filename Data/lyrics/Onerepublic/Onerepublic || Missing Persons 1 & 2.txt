
Used to come around here every day
Now you're breakin
Used to be the one that is not ashamed
Now you shamin
Lost in all the wars we fought
Never saw a road
Now that I think about you in the skies
I'd turn my row
And I wonder where you are
Now I wonder where you..
Are
(ooooh)

Take yourself down
Pick yourself up
Everything changed when you got along
7 point 1 took it all down
Suddenly you can't even be found
I said all night long

Missing person's in the window
Staring at me
Saying things I cant hear
A missing person's in the window
Staring at me
Haven't seen them in years

[Instrumental]

First things first
Second in command
Right as i'm trying to change my plan
Second gonna die
Oh he cant breathe
Everybody's staring straight at me
You spend it all chasing those lies
I dont really wanna take that chance
I dont really wanna do that dance
I dont know what to do till you say
Oh I dont wanna let you go
But I cant keep holding on
Skies of silver, Stars of gold
And now you know just what you like

So far this love is all I have
So far this hurt is all I have

Missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
A missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
Wonder where you...
