
I can't sleep, no, not like I used to
I can't breathe in and out like I need to
It's breaking ice now to make any movement
What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion

And all at once (as I'm trying)
I can help you out (just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need (I kill myself to make)
I'll do anything (everything perfect for you)
Goodbye, apathy,
So long, apathy

[Chorus:]
So don't sit still, but don't you move away from here
So goodbye, apathy (as I'm trying),
So long fancy free (just to keep things right)
Goodbye, apathy (I kill myself to make)
I don't wanna be you (everything perfect for you)

I don't walk right, not like I used to
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me
As long as you're close to me

Now that I'm alright (as I'm trying)
I can help you out (just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need (I kill myself to make)
I'll do anything (everything perfect for you)
Goodbye, apathy,
So goodbye, apathy

[Chorus:]
So don't you stop pushing me, I can take so much
So goodbye, apathy (as I'm trying),
So long fancy free (just to keep things right)
Goodbye, apathy (I kill myself to make)
I don't wanna be you (everything perfect for you)

[6x]
Everybody is watching you,
Everybody is watching me, too

(I can't sleep)
