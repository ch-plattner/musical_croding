
I found verity on N'Orleans Avenue
Down where the air is thick as L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down but it held through
It gave a little for the sake of staying true

We cut ties
We tell lies
We hate change
And we wanna claim where we feel
We take tolls
We rake coals
Yeah we dig holes
And we'll dig them right in your fields

We're waking up
We're waking up
And right on time
And right on time
We'll take these roads
We'll break them up
And right on time
And right on time!

We got cars
We write laws
We won't pause
Don't you know we're all wizards, welcome to Oz
We don't lose
We might bruise
Yeah we will rain fire on you till you're playing
All of your cards

We're waking up
We're waking up
And right on time
And right on time
We'll take these roads
We'll break them up
And right on time
And right on time!
On time!
On time!
Waking up!
Waking up!
Yeah

Oooh!
Oh!
Oooh!
