
Autumn wind turns again
The days are warm, start to fade
All that's here is still the same
Memories fall like rain

The only world I know
Steady as you go
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you

Sinking in the sand of time
A measurable bind, I'll be fine
I'll burn a fire above the air
So Heaven is still on my side

Where is it tonight
No more alibis
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you

Autumn wind turns again
The days are warm, start to fade
