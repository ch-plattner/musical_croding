When I was a kid
I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly
And I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window
In my hotel heart
When I was only 5 years old but 12 years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice
Echo in my mind
Said, "Son you got an angel,
To chase the devil at night."
Yeah

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves."
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of "have" and "have nots"
And as I walked through that storybook life
I was looking for an angel to chase the devil at night
Oh! Oh! Oh!

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about love
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves."
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Wave
Put your hands up and hands down
[3x]

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about life
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves."
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth.
