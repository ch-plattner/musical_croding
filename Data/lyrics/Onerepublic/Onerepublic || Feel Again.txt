It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that's been on the run

Heart's still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again

Yeah

Woo-hoo [x4]

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me

It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
[Album version:] Praying like a fool just shot the gun
[Radio version:] Praying like a fool just shy of a gun

Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again

But with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah, with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again
(I was a lonely soul)

Woo-hoo [x5]

(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you've shown me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again...

Woo-hoo
