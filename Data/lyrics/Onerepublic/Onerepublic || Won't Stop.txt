[Verse 1]
Uh ohh
Now i stared at you
From across the room
Until both my eyes were faded
I was in a rush
I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad that I waited
Well you were almost there
Almost mine...yeah
They say love ain't fair 
But I'm doing fine...

[Chorus]
Cause i swear it’s you
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you that I’ve waited for
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you that my heart beats for
And it isn’t gonna stop
No it just won’t stop
Uh oh oh
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Now you were fine by night
But when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday
And I’m a lucky soul
That holds your hand so tight
Hope you hear this one day
Don’t fool yourself
This is my truth

[Chorus]
I swear it’s you 
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you that i waited for
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you that my heart beats for
And it ain’t gonna stop
It just won’t stop

[Interlude]
You take this hand
You take this heart
Steal my bones
From 1000 miles apart
Feels so cold
Felt just like its ten shades of winter
And i need the sun
Ohh yeahh
Oh oh no no yeah yeah

[Chorus]
And i swear it’s you
I swear you
I swear it's you that it waited for
I swear it’s you
I swear its 
I swear it’s you that my heart beats for
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you that I’ve waited for   
I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it’s you that my heart beats for
And it ain’t gonna stop
It just won’t stop
Heyy yeahh
It just won’t stop
No no no no woahh yeah
I swear it’s you
I swear it’s you
Ohh yeah
