
I'm still feelin the rain fall
And bouncin off my skin
How long do I have to wait for
The sun to shine again
Come on paint me the rainbows
I can follow it
I don't know where it'll take me
But I like wonderin

Wherever you are
Where will you be
Are you the same or
Dreamin after waitin only for me
Waiting for love
Waiting for the same or
Dreamin on the other side
Hoping no matter how far I'll find my way to you
Followin a rainbow

I'm gonna stop in the middle
Hang my feet off the edge
I got no reason to worry
I know I'll find the end
That's where you'll be waiting
I hope you don't forget
That I won't quit till I find you
No matter the risk

Wherever you are
Where will you be
Are you the same or
Dreamin after waiting only for me
Waiting for love
Waiting for the same or
Dreamin on the other side hoping that
No matter how far I'll find my way to you
Followin a rainbow

Stuck in my mind
I'm wasting time
I'm still on my own
I never thought that I would find my way
Into the light
Dreamin to find
Who ever you are

Wherever you are
Where will you be
Are you the same or
Dreamin on the other side waiting for me
Waiting for love
Waiting for the same or
Dreamin on the other side hoping that
No matter how far I'll find my way to you
Followin a rainbow

Ooohooohooohooooh yea yea yea...
I know we're gonna find it
I know we're gonna find it
I'm never gonna let you go
I know I'm gonna find you
I know I'm gonna find you
I won't let you go

Followin the rainbow
Followin the rainbow
Followin followin
Followin the rainbow
I'm followin a rainbow

Whoa whoa whoa...

Followin the rainbow
Followin the rainbow
Followin followin
