[VERSE 1]
What are you trying to hide?
You won't let me inside.
The fear's only in your mind.
I can see it in your eyes.

[BRIDGE]
And I try to get through to you, 
But I don't know what to do.
You're making it hard
To get to your heart.
And it seems these days, 
That everybody wears
A bullet proof vest.

[CHORUS]
If love is a blank dart
Shot from a heart-shaped gun, 
It only hurts you
When you try to turn and run.
When will you see
That you don't need
A bullet proof vest?

[VERSE 2]
Please take it off for me.
I won't shoot, 
I'll let you breathe
I wanna feel you feeling me.
Oh, baby, love?
Don't bleed?

[BRIDGE]
And I try to get through to you.
I don't know what to do.
You're making it hard
To get to your heart.
And it seems these days, 
That everybody wears
A bullet proof vest.

[CHORUS]
If love is a blank dart, 
Shot from a heart-shaped gun, 
It only hurts you
When you try to turn and run.
When will you see that you don't need
A bullet proof vest?

[Repeat Chorus]
