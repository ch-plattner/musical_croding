
Try to keep you in my pocket
Couldn't stop you, couldn't stop it
You were running from the very start
I was driving with my hair down
With the breaks on, the lights out
We were drifting, didn't know how far

I see the way you look at me
It's not the same as it used to be
You can say what you want but
You can say what you want but you won't stay
Say goodbye, it's so messed up, I'm torn inside
You can say what you want but I

I just got to break free, free
I cry black tears and scream but you never hear me, me
I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go, let me
Let me go, let me go
The longer you take the harder I break
So let me break free

I remember how it started
Like a windstorm, couldn't fight it
We were strangers from the very start
Try to keep you in my pocket
Couldn't stop you, couldn't stop it
You were running, didn't know how far

I wish you'd just walk away
This is all that I can take
You can say what you want but I

I just got to break free, free
I cry black tears and scream but you never hear me, me
I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go, let me
Let me go, let me go
The longer you take the harder I break
So let me break free

I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go, let me
I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go, let me
Cause I know that I can't wait for you, baby

I just got to break free, free
I cry black tears and scream but you never hear me, me
I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go, let me
Let me go, let me go
The longer you take the harder I break

I just got to break free, free
I cry black tears and scream but you never hear me
I can't go on, playing along
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
The longer you take the harder I break
So let me break free
