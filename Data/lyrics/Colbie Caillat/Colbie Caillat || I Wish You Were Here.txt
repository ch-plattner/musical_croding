
Baby when you flew away
You took my love with you
I watched you leave into the sky
And I turned ocean blue
I'm erased- don't let it downpour
Tears are fallin' out
I don't wanna wait, I want you now

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Everywhere you go, you know my heart's gonna follow
Half of me is gone and I'm feeling kinda hollow
Turn the plane around and come back to me tomorrow
Oh, oh, I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here

Summer sun and matching pairs of footprints in the sand
I see lovers kissing left and then I can't pretend
That I don't crave the love we made
Don't want it again
Anywhere with you becomes a wondering

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Everywhere you go, you know my heart's gonna follow
Half of me is gone and I'm feeling kinda hollow
Turn the plane around and come back to me tomorrow
Oh, oh, I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here

When I'm with you I never sleep so I don't miss a thing
But when you're gone I stay in bed
'Cause you're my only dream

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Everywhere you go, you know my heart's gonna follow
Half of me is gone and I'm feeling kinda hollow
Turn the plane around and come back to me tomorrow
Oh, oh, I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here (oh)
I wish you were here.
