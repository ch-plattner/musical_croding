City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air, there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling (Ring a ling), hear them sing (Hear them sing)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hear

Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the country
Ring a ling (Ring a ling), hear them sing (Hear them sing)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in Hawaii
Ring a ling (Ring a ling), hear them sing (Hear them sing)
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day

Ou ou-ou
Ou ou-ou
