
Why is it so hard
It was so long ago
I don't know where to start or what to say to you
I've been all alone needing you by my side
But it's not too late
Maybe we just needed time
Can we try to let it go?
If we don't than we'll never know
I try to break through but you know that it's up to you

We say that time is meant to heal
But it still hurts inside
I wish that none of this was real
Cause we're so far behind

You've been all alone
Needing me by your side
But it's not too late
Maybe we just needed time
Can we try to let it go
If we don't than we'll never know
I try to break through
But you know that it's up to you

And I know that our love can grow
But this damn river needs to flow
I will try to break through but you know that it's up to you

It's time to make a stand
Maybe it won't last
But we should take this chance

Can we try to let it go
If we don't than we'll never know
I try to break through
But you know that it's up to you
I know that our love can grow
When this damn river needs to flow
I will try to break through
But you know that it's up to you

I'll try to break through but you that it's up to you
I'll try to break through but you that it's up to you
