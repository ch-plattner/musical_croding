
Remember the day our lips touched in the rain
Fire works through my veins into my heart
Remember the night’s dancing under the sky
I got lost in the moonlight. Found in your dark eyes

Ohh I wanna fall in love again but this time
But this time with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets
I don’t want just anyone. Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you 
With you. With you 
I wanna fall in love again with you 
With you.

Can we forget all the lies that we’ve led
Take us so far away from the truth
Can we erase all the tears and regrets
Fear hiding in the pain
The shadows of yesterday

Ohh I wanna fall in love again but this time
But this time with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets
I don’t want just anyone. Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you 
With you. With you 

We can take a blank white page
And fill it with the dreams we made
And let these scars slowly fade away

I wanna fall in love again but this time
with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets
I don’t want just anyone. Not anyone new

Oh no I don’t want just anyone 
Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you 
With you. With you 
I wanna be in love again with you 
With you.

I wanna be in love again
