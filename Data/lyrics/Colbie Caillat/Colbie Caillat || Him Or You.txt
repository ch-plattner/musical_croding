He's a sinking ship, you're a shining star
Him I want to rescue, but you would save my heart
He's a steady rock, but you're a blazing fire
He would hold me every night, but you would take me higher
No matter what I do, I can't have two

Tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or is it you?
I can't keep going along like this
Either way I win and lose
Tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or you, him or you?
Is it him or you, or is it you?

Whenever I'm with him, I always think of you
When I'm in your arms, I feel his too
So I got to know, before I lose you both
Which one I could let go, who I love the most
Should I follow my head or my heart

Tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or is it you?
I can't keep going along like this
Either way I win and lose
Tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or you, is it him or you?
Is it him or you, or is it you?

I'm feeling guilty every day
With both your hearts inside my hands
Because I know that one of you
Is never gonna understand

So tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or is it you?
I can't keep going along like this
Either way I win and lose
Tell me, how do I choose?
Is it him or you, is it him or you?
Is it him or you, or is it you?
