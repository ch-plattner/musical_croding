
Great 
Fake plastic Mistletoe
Wrap me in a great big bow
And tear me apart

It's Christmas time
So open up the flood gates
Tell me that you'll be late
And rip me apart

Cause you say that, you say that things will be alright
But I've heard that, I've heard that so many times and I know that

It's not Christmas if the snow don't fall
And I'm still standing here three feet small
Lose our troubles because after all
It's Christmas time

It's Christmas time...

Cold
Icing on the walkways
Slip in to the games we play
We're falling apart

A great big house
That's made out of ginger bread
Crumbles to the ground
We're breaking apart

But you said that, you said that things would be alright
But I've heard that, I've heard that so many times and I know that

It's not Christmas if the snow don't fall
And I'm still standing here three feet small
Lose our troubles because after all 
It's Christmas time

And I've been waiting for you to come
And it's hard cause I feel so alone
And I just want you to come home

Waiting for you to come
And it's hard cause I feel so alone
And I just want you to come home

It's not Christmas if the snow don't fall
And I'm still standing here three feet small
Lose our troubles because after all 
It's Christmas time

It's not Christmas if the snow don't fall
You're not here to keep me safe and warm
Lose our troubles because after all 
It's Christmas time

It's Christmas time again
And all your friends, all your friends
Are smiling
It's Christmas time
