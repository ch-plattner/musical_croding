
I'm just so tired of these troubles that I try to hide. 
Makes me wanna wash away my whole world inside. 
I think it's time that I make changes in the things I do. 
This weight on my chest I am ready to loose. 

And all this time I've been getting in my own way. 
I have to tell myself only I can be the one to make a change. 

Don't hold me down. 
Oh, I was getting so far. 
Don't hold me down. 
Cause I don't wanna fall apart. 
Don't hold me down. 
You see me waking up and feel it now. 
I'm breaking down and nothing's gonna stop me now. 

No, no. 

I have been rocking back and forth across the line. 
Hanging for a moment on the wrong side. 
Now I'm standing up, I think I'll be here for a while. 
Hope I rememeber how to keep on this steady smile. 

All that time I was getting in my own way. 
I had to tell myself only I could be the one to make a change. 

Don't hold me down. 
Oh, I was getting so far. 
Don't hold me down. 
Cause I don't wanna fall apart. 
Don't hold me down. 
You see me waking up and feel it now. 
I'm breaking down and nothing's gonna stop me now. 

I know I'm gonna fight it. 
I'm tired of being blinded. 
So.... 

I won't hold me down. 
Oh, I wanna go so far. 
I won't hold me down. 
I don't wanna fall apart. 
Don't hold me down. 
You see you're waking up and feel it now. 
I'm breaking down and nothing's gonna stop me now. 

No, no. 
Nothing's gonna stop me now. 
No, no, no. 
No, no. 
No, no.
