And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Auld lang syne

For auld lang syne
My dear, for auld lang syne

We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Auld lang syne

For auld lang syne
My dear, for auld lang syne

We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh
Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh
Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh deh

Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh
Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh
Deh deh deh deh deh deh deh-deh-deh deh

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Auld lang syne
