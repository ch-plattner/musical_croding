
I think you took my heart away when you said you're leaving
Cause' right now I am hurting all over again
And I never thought that I'd be in these places on this day
And now I don't know how much more that I can take

I'm breaking at the cracks
And everything goes black
It's another heart attack
And I can't handle that
Woo~ Love I need you back

I know that I'll get through this
The feeling is stronger somehow
I got my feet back on the ground
And I'm turning around
And I'll be everything you always said that I could be
If only you'll be waiting right here for me patiently

I'm breaking at the cracks
And everything goes black
It's another heart attack
And I can't handle that
Woo~ Love I need you back

Oh whenever would I take you back,
My heart was filled with love
And I wipe these tears and I will laugh
If only I could make it last

Breaking at the cracks
And everything goes black
It's another heart attack
And I can't handle that
Woo. Love I need you back
I need you back
I need you back
I need you back...
