
I don't know but I think I maybe
Fallin' for you dropping so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Waiting 'til I know you better

I am trying not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

I've been waiting all my life and now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm falling for you.
I'm falling for you.

As I'm standing here and you hold my hand
Pull me towards you and we start to dance

All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling.
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

I've been waiting all my life and now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I'm fallin' for you.

Oh, I just can't take it
My heart is racing
Emotions keep spinning out.

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

I've been waiting all my life and now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I'm fallin' for you.

I think I'm fallin' for you

I can't stop thinking about it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you

I can't stop thinking about it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I'm fallin' for you.

Oh
Oh no no
Oh

Oh, I'm falling for you
