
Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and
Tell him...

Tell him I need him tell him
Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Tell him And it'll be alright And it'll be alright

Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end
And tell him...

Tell him I need him tell him
Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Tell him And it'll be alright And it'll be alright

I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oh... and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright
Ya, ya, ya, ya... ya...

Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him...

Tell him I need him tell him
Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Tell him And it'll be alright
Tell him I need him tell him
Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Tell him And it'll be alright And it'll be alright
Tell him I need him tell him
Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Tell him And it'll be alright And it'll be alright
