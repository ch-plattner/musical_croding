
Oh I, Don't know what to say
And I, have told you lately
That I'm tired of talking about the same old reasons we change
Just take it easy don't worry about these mistakes

Because I'm keeping it cool, now thinking about you, sticking around and if we should pay
Tied down,looking around and I know what I want so don't hold me down
Oh I, I don't play games
And I, I have been learning

To just to let it all go and stay quiet when I feel like speaking
My mind done whatever it is I need to make clear and just say

That I'm keeping it cool, now thinking about you, sticking around and if we should pay
Tied down, I'm looking around and I know what I want so don't hold me down...
Down....
Down....
Don't you hold me down

Because I'm keeping it cool, now thinking about you, sticking around and if we should pay
Tied down, I'm looking around and I know what I want so don't hold me down

Oh I, I can't take it
So please please please won't you listen
To the troubles all around me, I'm caught up and I'm barely breathing
But I'm finding that holding on is harder than never leaving
