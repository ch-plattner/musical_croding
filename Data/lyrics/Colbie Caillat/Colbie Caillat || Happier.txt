
I was walking around with no place to go
Feelin' scared that I would never find home
I've been wondering if I was different from everyone else
I've found him

Baby, I was once alone
And you saved me
You walk on my heart
When you came to me
Didn't think I could love
But now I believe

'Cause you make me happier than I thought I could be
The simple love's taking over me
You've shown me a life I thought I didn't need
Dreams I left open are now complete

I've been watching people put pictures on walls
While I build mine up so high they had to fall
I'm so lucky you climbed to my side
You took and chance and you made it

Baby, I was once alone
And you saved me
You walk on my heart
When you came to me
I was skeptical
But now I believe

'Cause you make me happier than I thought I could be
The simple love's taking over me
You've shown me a life I thought I didn't need
Dreams I left open are now complete

Oh what was I so scared of?
Afraid of fallin' in love?
I guess I just hadn't met the right one
Then you came along

And you make me happier than I thought I could be
The simple love's taking over me
You've shown me a life I thought I didn't need
Dreams I left open are now complete

'Cause you make me happier than I thought I could be
The simple love's taking over me
You've shown me a life I thought I didn't need
Dreams I left open are now complete

Ooh, oh, oh oh, ooh ah, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh, ooh ah, oh... [fade]
