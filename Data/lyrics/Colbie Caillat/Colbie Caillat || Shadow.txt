
If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I can't get no sun in your shadow
If you ain't gonna love me, fight me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go
Go, go

Cause I've been hanging on the telephone,
Lines that you always told me
Now I can't let go
I've been living off the last time
You warm me with your words
But now I'm tired and I'm getting cold
Cold, oh, oh, oh

If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I can't get no sun in your shadow
If you ain't gonna love me, fight me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go
Go, go

Turn the other cheek and go, go, go

Cause every time I push
You hold me just close enough to keep me here
So pull your anchor up
And head to shore or sail away, oh
If you wanna leave,
If you wanna leave
Then just go

Cause I've been hanging on the telephone
Lines that you always told me
Now I can't let go
I've been living off the last time
You told me you would try
But boy this is getting old
So old

If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I can't get no sun in your shadow
If you ain't gonna love me, fight me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go, go, go

Turn the other cheek and go, go, go

I'm better off alone,
Better off alone
