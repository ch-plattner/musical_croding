Turn down the silence 
Inside my head 
Bring back the colors 
Were you insane? 
Further from where I've started 
Further to go 
Keeping my heart under control 

Why do I still feel you? Feel you 
And all you've got 
I still feel you, feel you 
All I need is you 
All I need is to feel you, feel you 

Why did you change your mind and run away? 
Thoughts of you by my side 
Are starting to fade 
I know that you should be mine 
So I wont let go 
Everyday I'm trying to get close 

Why do I still feel you? Feel you 
And all you got 
I still feel you, feel you 
All I need is you 
All I need is to feel you, feel you 

Stop running all the time 
Don't fight the feeling inside 
Cause when you try it hard 
Don't matter where you go it's deep in your soul
