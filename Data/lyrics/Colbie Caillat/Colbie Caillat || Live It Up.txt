Live it up up I
Live it up up I

A thousand people stood in line
To hear a couple words of mine
Afraid I would miss a beat
And everyone's watching me
I don't know why I'm still afraid
It's not like it was yesterday
I'm the one stopping me
From all that I want to be

It's ridiculous
The stars are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy ever after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
I break down the walls
I back hand and smash 'em all
I live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
Ooh ooh
Live it up up I
Ooh ooh
Live it up up I

Don't know why my stomach drops
Like jumping off a mountain top
I used to be fearless when I had my safety net
Wake up my heart is beating fast
Cause I ain't got no strings attached
Afraid I'd go anywhere, everywhere
It's just that I don't know where

It's ridiculous
The stars are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy ever after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
I break down the walls
I back hand and smash 'em all
I Live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
Ooh ooh
Live it up up I
Ooh ooh
Live it up up I

No I'm not afraid
No I'm not afraid
Live it up up I
Ooh no I'm not afraid
Live it up up I
Oooh, yeah, yeah

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I Live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
I break down the walls
I back hand and smash 'em all
I Live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up up I
Live it up
Live it up baby
Live it up
Live it up baby
Live it up
Live it up baby
Live it up
Live it up baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Yeah yeah yeah
Oooh, yeah!
