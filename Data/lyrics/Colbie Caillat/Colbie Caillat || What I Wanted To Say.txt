
I should've done something
Again I did nothing
Watched us separate
What should I do now
Run and chase you down?
I can't hesitate

'Cause all I wanted to say was something real
All I want you to know is how I feel 
All I wanted to give was my heart
But I'm stuck here at the start 

It's on the tip of my tongue but I'm still afraid 
Sometimes the only things words do is get in the way
Sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say
But I don't want to lose you, drive you away
Don't want to confuse you, I need you to stay
Only wish you knew what I wanted to say
Only wish you knew what I wanted to say 

My hands are shaking 
I'm yours for the taking 
Don't you  hesitate
Please just do one thing
One small sign, something
Let's jump off the edge 

'Cause all I want you to say is something real
All I wanted to know is how you feel
All I want you to give is your heart
But we're stuck here at the start 

It's on the tip of my tongue but I'm still afraid 
Sometimes the only things words do is get in the way
Sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say 
But I don't want to lose you, drive you away 
Don't want to confuse you, I need you to stay
Only wish you knew what I wanted to say
Only wish you knew what I wanted to say 

It's on the tip of my tongue but I'm still afraid 
Sometimes the only things words do is get in the way
Sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say
But I don't want to lose you

I don't wanna lose you
No I dont wanna lose you
No I dont wanna lose you

I should've done something, I should've done something
I should've done something but I never wanted to
I should've done something, I should've done something
I should've done something but I never wanted to
(I don't want to lose you, drive you away)
I don't wanna lose you
(I only wish you knew what I wanted to say)
No I dont wanna lose you
(What I wanted to say)

I should've done something, I should've done something
I should've done something but I never wanted to
I should've done something, I should've done something
I should've done something but I never wanted to
