Boy I see you lookin’ over 
You keep on looking back at what you knew 
When will you come closer 
Closer to the one that's good for you 

Cause you're still goin’ back to that life 
And I refuse to stand on the side 
By sparing her from heartache 
Don’t you know you end up hurting me 

I see your head spinning right around 
She makes you fall hard and hit the ground 
When you ever gonna let her go 
I see the way that she breaks you so 
All I’m asking is for you please 
To take control and be set free 
Make the space so we can grow 
Save us before I let you go 

So you say this will get better 
Better for you, her, or me? 
Well I don’t know what to tell ya 
It’s not my fault that I don’t believe 

Cause you're still so stuck in that life 
And I refuse to stay on this ride
Cause we’re goin’ round in circles
Aren’t you tired of never having peace

I see your head spinning right around 
She makes you fall hard and hit the ground 
When you ever gonna let her go 
I see the way that she breaks you so 
All I’m asking is for you please 
To take control and be set free 
Make the space so we can grow 
Save us before I let you go 

I have been waiting 
For you to change this
But it has taken too long 
So I can’t keep waiting 
I’ve got to change this 
It's hard for me to have to be so strong 

I see your head spinning right around 
She makes you fall hard and hit the ground 
When you ever gonna let her go 
I see the way that she breaks you so 
All I’m asking is for you please 
To take control and be set free 
Make the space so we can grow 
Save us before I let you go

I see your head spinning right around 
She makes you fall hard and hit the ground 
When you ever gonna let her go 
I see the way that she breaks you so 
All I’m asking is for you please 
To take control and be set free 
Make the space so we can grow 
Save us before I let you go

Oh baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I 
Don’t wanna let you go 
I don’t wanna let you go
Save us before I let you go 

Oh baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I 
Don’t wanna let you go 
I don’t wanna let you go 
Oh no, oh no 
No I don’t ever wanna let you go...
