
You've got magic inside your finger tips
Its leaking out all over my skin
Everytime that I get close to you
Your making me weak with the way you
Look through those eyes

[Chorus:]
But all I see is your face
All I need is your touch
Wake me up with your lips
Come at me from up above

Yeah, oh I need you

I remember the way that you move
Your dancing easily through my dreams
Its hittin me harder and harder with all your smiles
You are crazy gentle in the way you kiss

[Chorus]

Oh baby I need you
To see me, the way I see you
Lovely, wide awake in
The middle of my dreams

[Chorus]

All I see is your face
All I need is your touch
Wake me up with your lips
Come at me from up above
Yeah, oh oh da da da do do do do do
Ah, I ..... I need you
