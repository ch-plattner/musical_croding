Dear someone 
Have you ever wanted out 
Of all the stressfulness 
All the busyness 
You could do without 
Take all of your worries 
Throw them away 
Everyday should be a fun day 
That's what I say 

All I want is a dream life life 
With the ones I love 
Playing all day long 
Laying back by the water side 
With nowhere to go 
And the music on 
All I want is my dream life 
To be my real life 
How could that be wrong 
All we have is this life 
So make it be what you want 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 

Dear summer 
Will you find your way back home 
I miss your golden kiss 
How you warm my skin 
Where did you go?
Take all of my worries 
And burn them up 
Everyday will be a fun day 
Unlock my handcuffs 

All I want is a dream life life 
With the ones I love 
Playing all day long 
Laying back by the water side 
With no where to go
And the music on 
All I want is my dream life 
To be my real life
How could that be wrong 
All we have is this life 
So make it be what you want 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 

No I did not call in sick to work today 
No I’m not out hanging with my friends 
There’s no more wasting time on what I think I’m supposed to do 
My clock is standing still so 
I can have my dream life life 
With the ones I love 
Playing all day long 
Laying back by the water side 
With nowhere to go 
And the music on 
I’m working hard for my dream life 
To be my real life 
And that can’t be wrong 
All I have is this life 
So I’m making it what I want 

All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All we have is this life 
Lets make it be what we want 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life 
All I want is a dream life, life...
