She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Oooh it makes you wanna cry

She doesn't know your name 
And your heart beats like a subway train
Oooh it makes you wanna die

Oooh don't you wanna take her?
Wanna make her all your own?

Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candlelights

I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and full of fire

Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire

Don't you wanna make her?
Oooh don't you wanna take her home?

Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candlelights

Oooh don't you wanna break her?
Oooh don't you wanna take her home?

She walks like she don't care
You wanna take her everywhere
Oooh it makes you wanna cry

She's like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
Oooh it makes you wanna die

Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candlelights

Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candlelights

Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candlelights
