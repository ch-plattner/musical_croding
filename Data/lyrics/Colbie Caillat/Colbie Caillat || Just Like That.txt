I know it's been a while
And I don't want to do this
But I've been thinking about how we used to be, yeah
Looking backward now is on the verge of stupid
I don't know what I was thinking but I know you put a hold on me
You stole my heart and you broke in
Started the flame I'm burning
You broke me down and I gave in
Every single time you pull me in you push me out again

Just like that
You're going for me
Just like that
If I had meant anything, you'd had never done me just like that, yes
I'm on into just like that
Yes I can breath
Just like that
So when you save me
I think you better run away fast
Some day, just like that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'mma do you just like... yeah yeah
Cause I'mma do you just like

You say you need to talk
Because you really miss me oh oh
I think I'm strong enough
But who am I kidding?
You own my heart and you know it
Fueled in the flame I'm burning
You break me down and I give in
Every single time you pull me in you push me out again

Just like that
You're going for me
Just like that
If I had meant anything, you'd had never done me just like that, yes
I'm on into just like that
Yes I can breath
Just like that
So when you save me
I think you better run away fast
Some day, just like that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'mma do you just like... yeah yeah
I'mma do you just like
Yeah yeah
Cause I'mma do you just like

I'm feeling much smarter
Reset
I'm never gonna fall all over again
I'm through with this
Every single time you pull me in you push me out again
Cause every single time you pull me in you push me out again

Just like that
Just like that
Just like that
If I had meant anything, you'd had never done me just like that, yes
So I'mma do you just like that
Cause I can't do it just like that
So when you see me, I think you better run away fast
Cause I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like
I'mma do you just like that
I'mma do you just like that
