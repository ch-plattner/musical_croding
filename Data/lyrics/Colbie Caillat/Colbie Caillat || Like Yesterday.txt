
I remember like yesterday I 
Carried a heart without hope
Had given up on mystery I 
Only saw mirrors and smoke 
Thought I was fine alone 
That’s just because I didn’t know 

I remember like yesterday
Lovin you seemed far away 
We were friends in different places 
Then love began leavin traces
Sitting with u on a crowded bus
It seemed like just the 2 of us
That night everything was changed 

I remember like yesterday 
I was livin’ in black and white a
Careful and colorless life
You are like a neon light
Shined through my closed my eyes
All the right ones, they turned out wrong
But you were here all along

I remember like yesterday
Lovin you seemed far away
We were friends in different places 
Then love began leavin traces
Little folded up love letters
Sweet songs written for each other 
Everything was about to changed 

I remember like yesterday 
You came just in time for me
You changed my mind so easily
Now its you and me
I remember like yesterday
Lovin’ you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leavin’ traces 
With a first time I love you
On a Paris afternoon 
And now everything has changed 

I remember like yesterday 
I remember like yesterday
Lovin’ you seemed far away
Thought I could live without you 
So glad I finally found you
On the street in the pouring rain 
Our hearts both found their ways 
I love how everything changed

I remember ’cause its today 
On a stairway in the park
In the starlight after dark
Sweet kisses in the pouring rain
