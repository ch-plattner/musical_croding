Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
oh oh oh 

I’m not satisfied  
With pretty little things and not your time  
Forgive me if I need you 
But that's what I got used to
Like stayin’ at home on a Friday night
Fallin’ asleep outside by fire light 
You were all around me 
That's how it has to be 

Baby, baby, love me, love me
In stereo 
Wrap both arms around me 
Don’t you ever let me go
I wanna hear you say you love me in both ears
Just like guitars on the radio
So baby, baby, love me, love me 
In stereo, in stereo, 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Hey I’ve got a plan
Let's get out of town and not look back 
Just me and you again
Laugh and smile and play pretend

Baby, baby, love me, love me
In stereo 
Wrap both arms around me
Don’t you ever let me go 
I wanna hear you say you love me in both ears 
Just like guitars on the radio
So baby, baby, love me, love me 
In stereo, in stereo, 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 

Lets take all the good times
And put ’em in a song 
No matter where we are we can both sing along 

Baby, baby, love me, love me
In stereo 
Wrap both arms around me
Don’t you ever let me go 
I wanna hear you say you love me in both ears 
Just like guitars on the radio

Baby, baby, love me, love me 
In stereo 
Wrap both arms around me
Don’t you ever let me go 
I wanna hear you say you love me in both ears 
Just like guitars on the radio
So baby, baby, love me, love me 
In stereo, in stereo 

Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
