January always brought me down
All the magic of December
Is like a circus leaving town
All I wanna do is to follow it around
Cause everybody wishes it was Christmas all year 'round

To wake up every morning
With a present in my bed
That's how I've been feeling
Since the moment we first met

And I don't need the snow to fall
And I don't need the light to shine
And I don't need a mistletoe
Cause I'll still kiss you all the time

We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
And I still get just as excited
When we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as
Every day you are mine

Spring is coming but the air is chilled
It remind me of the winter fires we would always build
Hiding from the cold is always warmer in your arms
Whenever you are kissing me, it is Chrismas in my heart

I don't need the snow to fall
And I don't need the light to shine
And I don't need a mistletoe
Cause I'll still kiss you all the time

We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
And I still get just as excited
When we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as
Every day you are mine

Are we dreaming?
Dreaming, dreaming
I believe it
Believe it, believe it

Now January doesn't bring me down
Cause the magic of December is always here
When you're around

No we don't need the snow to fall
We don't need the lights to shine
We don't need a mistletoe
Cause we'll be kissing all the time

We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
We still get just as excited
When we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as
Every day you are mine

Every day is Christmas
Every day is Christmas
(Every day you are mine)
Every day is Christmas

Every day is Christmas
(You are mine, Every day, every day)
Every day is Christmas

Every day is Christmas
Every day is Christmas

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
