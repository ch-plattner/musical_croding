There you see her 
Sitting there across the way 
She don't got a lot to say 
But there's something about her 
And you don't know why 
But you're dying to try 
You wanna kiss the girl 

Yes, you want her 
Look at her, you know you do 
It's possible she wants you, too 
There is one way to ask her 
It don't take a word 
Not a single word 
Go on and kiss the girl 

Sing with me now 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
My, oh, my 
Look at the boy too shy 
He ain't gonna kiss the girl 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Ain't that sad 
Ain't it shame, too bad 
You gonna miss the girl 

Now's your moment 
Floating in a blue lagoon 
Boy, you better do it soon 
No time will be better 
She don't say a word 
And she won't say a word 
Until you kiss the girl 

Sing with me now 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
My, oh, my 
Look at the boy too shy 
He ain't gonna kiss the girl 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Ain't that sad 
Ain't it shame, too bad 
You gonna miss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Don't be scared 
You got the mood prepared 
Go on and kiss the girl 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Don't stop now 
Don't try to hide it how 
You wanna kiss the girl 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Float along 
Listen to the song 
The song say kiss the girl 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la 
Music play 
Do what the music say 
You wanna kiss the girl 

You've got to kiss the girl 
Why don't you kiss the girl 
You gotta kiss the girl 
Go on and kiss the girl
