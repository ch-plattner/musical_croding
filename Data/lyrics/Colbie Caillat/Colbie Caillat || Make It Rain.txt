
I don't care what they say
Cause I have seen when we run we make it rain
Let's keep going for miles
Playin under the stormy darkened skies
Can you be mine?

Push me to the wall let them see baby I don't care at all
I'm not letting this go
Like a flower breaking through we've grown
Together now

I don't care what they say cause I have seen when we run we make it rain
There's nothing better than this
I'll keep wanting you for just one more kiss
So make it rain

When the world makes me tired, and my mind feels
Like it was set on fire, you look at me and smile,
With your brown eyes you call my heart and I can breathe again.

I don't care what they say cause I have seen when we run we make it rain
There's nothing better than this
I'll keep wanting you for just one more kiss
So make it rain

I'm waiting for you to become mine
Maybe this is not the right time
Should we hold off just a little while

I'm waiting for you to become mine
Baby this is not the right time
Should we hold off just a little while
Until you're mine

Well I don't care what they say
'Cause I have seen when we run we make it rain
There's nothing better than this
I'll keep wanting you for just one more kiss
Can you be mine?

Cause I don't care what they say
Cause I have seen when we run we make it rain
There's nothing better than this
I'll keep wanting you for just one last kiss

Can you be mine?
Can you be mine?
Can you be mine?
Ohh now you're mine
