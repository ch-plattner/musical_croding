If we find that our vision is blinded
We should slow down and maybe we will find it
Every heart just needs a little time to grow
If we go through a little bit of hard times
You should know that to fix it it'll take time
Baby hold on before we start to lose control

What can I say, what can I do
How do we change, I'm not gonna lose you

If the world stops turning
If the sun stops burning
When the cold winds starts to blow
I wanna let you know, oh I'll never let you go
When you feel like breaking
When your heart keeps waiting
When the tears begin to flow
I wanna let you know, oh I'll never let you go

Don't hide those feelings inside 'cause
If they're tucked back they could turn your heart black
How long will it take for us to let this go

We you just wait, will you let loose
Will you know, my feelings are true

If the world stops turning
If the sun stops burning
When the cold winds starts to blow
I wanna let you know, oh I'll never let you go
When you feel like breaking
When your heart keeps waiting
When the tears begin to flow
I wanna let you know, oh I'll never let you go

Baby I am standing here
Trying to get past the fear
Hoping you will let me go
Oh, I wanna let you know

If the world stops turning
If the sun stops burning
When the cold winds starts to blow
I wanna let you, oh I'll never let you go
When you feel like breaking
When your heart keeps waiting
When the tears begin to flow
I wanna let you know, oh I'll never let you go

Oh, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Oh, I wanna let you know, I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you go
Oh, I wanna let you know, I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you go
I'm gonna let you know, I'll never let you go
I'm gonna let you know, oh I'll never let you go
