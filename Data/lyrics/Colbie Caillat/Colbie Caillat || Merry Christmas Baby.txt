You surely treat me nice
Merry christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
And feel just like I'm livin', livin' in paradise

Now you see, I feel real good tonight
Got music on the radio
Yeah, I feel real good tonight
Got music on the radio

And feel like I wanna kiss you
Underneath the mistletoe
Now listen, santa came down the chimney
Half past three
With lots of little presents for my baby and me

Merry christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
And feel just like I'm livin', livin' in paradise
Merry christmas, baby
Merry christmas, baby

Well now, santa came down the chimney
Half past three
With lots of little presents for my baby and me

Merry christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
And feel just like I'm livin', livin' in paradise

Merry christmas, baby
Oh yeah, I said
Merry christmas, baby, yeah
(Merry christmas, baby)

Merry christmas, baby
(Merry christmas, baby)
Oh, merry christmas, baby, yeah
(Merry christmas, baby)
And feel just like I'm livin', livin' in paradise

Merry christmas, baby
