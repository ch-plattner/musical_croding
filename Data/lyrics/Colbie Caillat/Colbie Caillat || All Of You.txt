
I know that I was wrong
When I read your letters
But I just had to know
If you still miss her
'Cause you feel far away
When I kiss you
And every word you say
Sounds so confused
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna stay

So tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
And I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beating part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad
It's you I want
All of you

No matter what I'm feeling
I won't hide it
And know that you can tell me
Every secret
'Cause I'm no good at guessing
I just need to know

Tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
And I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beating part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad
It's you I want
All of you

All of you
All of you
All of you
So tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
And I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beating part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad
It's you I want
Just all of,
It's you I want
Just all of you
You... you... you... you...
You... you... you... you...
