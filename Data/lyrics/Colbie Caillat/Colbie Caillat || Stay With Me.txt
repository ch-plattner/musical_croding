
We simply fit together like a piece of apple pie
I will be vanilla ice cream
And I'll sing you lullabies
I will love you in the moonlight and I'll love you in the day
Always
I love the time we spend
Like a watch from an old friend
I will help you keep your smile
Promise me you'll stay awhile
I will come to you in need
And I'll help you when I can
When I can
Stay with me
Promise me you're never gonna leave
Stay with me yeah
Lets try to be the best that we can be
Take our time
We always joke together
Laugh till we're rolling on the floor
I like the way you dance around when you're running for the door
I will come to visit you
Even when we're old and grey
Always
I love the way you make me feel
When you're asleep I'll take the wheel
Make sure to call when you get home
When you're driving on the road
I will come to you in need and I'll help you when I can
Oh when I can
So
Stay with me
Promise me you're never gonna leave
Stay with me
Lets try to be the best the we can be
Take our time
I'll come to you in need and I'll help you when I can
I will help you yeah
I will come to you in need and I'll help you when I can
I will help you when I can
Oh oh yeah
So stay with me
Promise you youre never gonna leave
Stay with me yeah
Lets try to be the best that we can be
And take our time
Oooh
