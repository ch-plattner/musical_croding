
Someone left your heart shattered
Someone brought you home flowers
You fell off of that ladder but you've got the power
To get back up when you're feeling not okay and you don't know
Shine a light in your shadows, you're not alone cause

Everybody's been broken, everybody's been down
Keep the floodgates open, let it all out, yeah
Everybody's been broken, everybody's been down
Keep the floodgates open, let it all out, cause

Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire
So let them fall, so let them fall, so let them fall

Standing there in your white dress
Trapped alone with your secrets
Wanting all that you can't get
This power and this weakness
Fall in love with your downfalls
Make the best of your bad calls
Throw regret out the window
You're not alone cause

Everybody's been broken, everybody's been down
Keep the floodgates open, let it all out, cause

Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
Every tear can put out a fire
So let them fall, so let them fall, so let them fall
