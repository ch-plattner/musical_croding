
It's almost Christmas
Everyone is wishing for everything they always wanted
And a beautiful, shiny winter wonderland
It's too easy to get temped

Cinnamon cider, sparking diamonds
Presents too big for the tree
So much shopping, there's no time left
For my friends and my family

Maybe we worry too much about wishing
And not enough about giving
Cause some people have nothing at all

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you

So let just spend some time together
And be grateful that we're safe and warm
That our homes are filled with songs and laughter
We gather by the fire making s'mores

It's caring and sharing
All of the good things
Not taking anything for grated
And we have

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you

I remember Christmas day
We run outside and play
Easy snow, snow fight, snowman
Scenery in your eyes, holding grandpa in

I'm just asking for one day
Let's keep making memories
Can we stay whole together, please?
By the Christmas tree

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you
Son here's my happy Christmas to you
