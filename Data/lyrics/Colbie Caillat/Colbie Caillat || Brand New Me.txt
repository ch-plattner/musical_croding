
This is my same old coat
And my same old shoes
I was the same old me
With the same old blues
Then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
Now I look in the mirror
And see a brand new girl

I got a brand new walk
A brand new smile
Since I met you baby
I got a brand new style

Just because of you, boy
Just because of you
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you

I got the same old friends
They got the same old sins
I tell the same old jokes
Give the same old grins
But now the jokes sound new
And the laughter does too
Everyday of my life
As fresh as morning dew

Just because of you, boy
Just because of you
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you

I go to the same old places
See the same old faces
Look at the same old skies
See them all with brand new eyes
Ooh, ooh
