When I was a little girl I never was a princess type
I didn't do fairy tales or wish on stars at night
All the other girls are living in make believe
Searching for the one boy of their dreams

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Everywhere I go see a trail of broken hearts
And one by one I watch them fall apart
I told myself I won't let that be me
I'll take my time for ever after happily

I'll save my love for love in a land called far away
Until then well, love, your heart's gonna have to wait
When I find my love that I will love every day
Ooh ooh, where hearts don't have to break
And I'll stay in love in a land called far away

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Run along little boy, you're just distracting me
I've got things to learn and places I should be
Though I appreciate the way you feel for me
Truth is I'm miles away from feeling that kind of thing

I'll save my love for love in a land called far away
Until then well, love, your heart's gonna have to wait
When I find my love that I will love every day
Ooh ooh, where hearts don't have to break
And I'll stay in love in a land called far away

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

I'll be still til the day love comes calling me
Until that day I'll be fine

I'll save my love for love in a land called far away
Until then well, love, your heart's gonna have to wait
When I find my love that I will love every day
Ooh ooh, where hearts don't have to break

I'll save my love for love in a land called far away
Until then well, love, your heart's gonna have to wait
When I find my love that I will love every day
Ooh ooh, where hearts don't have to break
And I'll stay in love in a land called far away

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
