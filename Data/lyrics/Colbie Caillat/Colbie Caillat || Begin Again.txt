
I can't get you out of the sunlight
I can't get you out of the rain
I can't get you back to that one time
Cause you and me are still recovering

So let's just, try to cool it down
The fighting, this feeling of flames
So let's just try to slow it down
We crash when we race

Oh this is not the way that it should end
It's the way it should begin
It's the way it should begin, again
No, I never wanna fall apart,
Never wanna break your heart
Never wanna let you break my own
Yes, I know we've said a lot of things
That we probably didn't mean
But it's not too late to take them back
So, before you say you're gonna go...
I should probably let you know
That I never knew what I had...
I never knew what I had...

See I look for you in the morning
Cause that's what my mind always calls
And I can't wait to get to the evening
Cause that's when I want you the most

So let's just try to cool it down
The fighting, this feeling of flames
So let's just try to slow it down
We crash when we race

Oh this is not the way that it should end
It's the way it should begin
It's the way it should begin, again
No, I never wanna fall apart,
Never wanna break your heart
Never wanna let you break my own
Yes, I know we've said a lot of things
That we probably didn't mean
But it's not too late to take them back
So, before you say you're gonna go...
I should probably let you know
That I never knew what I had...
I never knew what I had...

But I know it now...
I wish I would've known before
How good we were...
Or is it too late to come back
Or is it's really over,
If it's really over...

But this is not the way that it should end
It's the way it should begin
It's the way it should begin, again
No, I never wanna fall apart,
Never wanna break your heart
Never wanna let you break my own
Yes, I know we've said a lot of things
That we probably didn't mean
But it's not too late to take them back
So, before you say you're gonna go...
I should probably let you know
That I never knew what I had...
I never knew what I had...

I never knew what I had...
I never knew what I had...
I never knew what I had...
