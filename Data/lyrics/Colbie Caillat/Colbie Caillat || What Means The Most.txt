
The other day when someone asked me
"Are you living your dream? "
I didn't know what to say
I honestly had to think
I try to be so many places at the same time
Every day a million things cluttering up my mind
Another feather falling off my wings
I climb so high it gets hard to breathe
Forget to remember what I really need

What means the most to me
Is waking up next to you
Feel the morning breeze
You're my favorite thing and I love
Coming home to your arms
When you kiss me hello
It's these simple things
That mean the most to me
That mean the most to me, yeah

Every time I have to leave
I feel like I am leaving a part of me
You're the only place I wanna be
Well nothing else matters I just lose focus
When you're not around you're still the only one I notice
I can't help the way I feel
It doesn't matter if I win or lose

'Cause what means the most to me
Is waking up next to you
When you're holding me
And have a little time to play
In your arms, race your heart, laugh 'til it gets dark
It's these simple things that mean the most to me

No more days far away where I miss you
No more nights trying to fall asleep without you
From now on I'm always gonna be there
I won't miss another day that we won't share
I'll be there

'Cause you mean the most to me
Oh, you mean the most to me
Now that I'm here with you
I will stay by your side
I won't leave you this time
Oh no

The next time that someone asks me
"Are you living your dream? "
I guess I'll know what to say
I won't even have to think
