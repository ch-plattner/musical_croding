I love Christmas in the snow
But Christmas in the sand oh man
I tell you that's where it's at
Hawaiian tropic on my skin
Candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

But I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

I must have had too much to drink
Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green
I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run, so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand
Don't need your winter coat
Don't need you winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back

You'll see Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he'll try too soon
He'll laugh so hard that he can barely breathe
It's what he did to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand
I love Christmas in the sand
