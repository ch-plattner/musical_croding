
Waited all my life for this day to come
Feel like letting go, life goes on
Wasting no more time, so much to be done
Everything works out, so they say

Over my shoulder, it's tough getting older
Yeah, yeah

Seems that nothing is black and white anymore
Shades of gray and I feel the weight over my shoulder
It's tough getting older
I always thought that I knew where I'd wanna go
But now I'm here and I find that I'm still getting colder
It's kinda tough getting older

Here before my eyes, many roads ahead
Time for me to choose one way now
If I take a chance, what lies down the road?
Feeling so confused, turned around

On and on, on and on and on
Yeah, yeah

Seems that nothing is black and white anymore
Shades of gray and I feel the weight over my shoulder
It's tough getting older
I always thought that I knew where I'd wanna go
But now I'm here and I find that I'm still getting colder
It's kinda tough getting older

I never thought that I'd feel this way
I always knew that my life would change
On and on, yeah yeah

Waited all my life for this day to come in
I feel like letting go, life goes on
Over my shoulder (on and on)
It's tough getting older (on and on, on)
Yeah, yeah

Seems that nothing is black and white anymore
Shades of gray and I feel the weight over my shoulder
It's tough getting older
I always thought that I knew where I'd wanna go
But now I'm here and I find that I'm still getting colder
It's kinda tough getting older

Waited all my life for this day to come
Oh, oh, oh
