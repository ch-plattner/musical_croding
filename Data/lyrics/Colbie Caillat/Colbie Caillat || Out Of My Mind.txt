
You called me on the phone today
Said those words you always say and I cried
I've gotta figure out what's going on
Inside this head of mine, I try

I'm going crazy thinkin' 'bout the way
I shouldn't have left it all behind
But now I'm gone and somethings wrong
I changed my mind

I'm so in love with you
I don't know what to do this time
And though you're out of sight
You're never ever out of my mind

I saw you just the other day
Those feelings never went away
And I smiled

I told you I'd be back
You know I want us to be friends
And be alright

Don't know what to say
It's getting harder everyday
But it takes time

You should know
I'm coming home, standby

I'm so in love with you
I don't know what to do this time
And though you're out of sight
You're never ever out of my mind

And as the time passes by
I fall asleep, without you by my side
I go out of my mind
Remembering the way we were before.

I'm so in love with you
I don't know what to do this time
And though you're out of sight
You're never ever out of my mind

Oh no, no no no, ooh, ooh

I'm so in love with you
I don't know what to do this time
