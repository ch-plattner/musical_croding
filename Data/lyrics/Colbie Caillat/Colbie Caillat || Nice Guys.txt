
She's blinded by a smooth talker telling her good looking lies
She hates but she loves it, she hates but she loves it
She craves the wrong hot blooded temporary kind of love
She hates but he loves it, she hates but he loves it

He's gon chew you up, he's gon spit you out
You take it 'cause you want it and you want it now

She don't won't the nice guy, she don't want the right guy
She wants the one night good time and that's why
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last
When you meet a nice guy you should be polite, why
You want to hop in every kind of night guy
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last

She's sweet as pie, she knows that she's the apple of his eye
He hates that he loves her, he hates that he loves her
She's gon pick you up, she's gon push you down
He takes it 'cause he wants it and he wants it now

She don't won't the nice guy, she don't want the right guy
She wants the one night good time and that's why
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last
When you meet a nice guy you should be polite, why
You want to hop in every kind of night guy
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last

He's gon chew you up, he's gon spit you out
You take it 'cause you want it and you want it now

She don't want the nice guy, she don't want the right guy
She wants the one night good time and that's why
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last
When you meet a nice guy you should be polite, why
You want to hop in every kind of night guy
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last

Finish last
When you meet a nice guy you should be polite, why
You want to hop in every kind of night guy
Nice guys finish last, nice guys finish last
