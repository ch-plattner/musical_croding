I'm leaving you
I'm not sure if that's what I should do
It hurts so bad
I'm wanting you but can't go back
Trying to find, to find
That all elusive piece of mind
Stuck here somehow
Shrouded beneath my fear and doubt
And I don't need it

Cause I'm walkin down this road alone and figured all I'm thinking bout is you, is you my love
And my head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away and I'm just waiting for
The droplets, droplets

[Jason Reeves:]
You left a mark
I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To Remind me that I feel the best
When I'm with you
Everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret and I don't need it

Cause I'm walkin down this road alone and figured all I'm thinking bout is you, is you my love
And my head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away and I'm just waiting to fall and sink into your skin

You are like the raindrops, the raindrops falling down on me

[Jason Reeves (Colbie Caillat):]
You left a mark (you left a mark)
She left a mark (he left)
She left (he left)
She left a mark
And I don't (I don't)
Need it. (Need it)
