That you couldn't fail
Oh would you dream if you knew
That your dreams had sails
There's a gulf you can never give us
There's a lot of fuel in you and below
Would you give it all you got
If you knew you would be loved

When your gates fall, and your guard's going down
When your heart calls and you let it all out
Whoa whoa, you know you found bigger love
When it's magic, what you touch turns to gold
And you're screaming for the whole world to know
Whoa whoa you know you found bigger love, bigger love

Every mistake that you made
Turns into something better
Every fear that you face
Will just make you stronger
Close your eyes and thinking at all 
Though you might of second guessed just know 
Just give it all you got
If you got something you love

When your gates fall, and your guard's going down
When your heart calls and you let it all out
Whoa whoa, you know you found bigger love
When it's magic, what you touch turns to gold
And you're screaming for the whole world to know
Whoa whoa you know you found bigger love, bigger love

When your gates fall, and your guard's going down
When your heart calls and you let it all out
Whoa whoa, you know you found bigger love
When it's magic, what you touch turns to gold
And you're screaming for the whole world to know
Whoa whoa you know you found bigger love, bigger love
