
I was running in circles
Was only a matter of time
Before I found myself drowning in troubled lies
Was starring back at what I'd seen for a long, long time
How did I break it?
How did I clear my mind?

This feeling just gets better all the time
So beautiful in front of me that I can't believe my eyes
I know it from move ahead time is one my side
I'm free from the circle
There'll be no regrets this time

I was hiding in places I knew nobody could find
Until I found myself spinning in rewind
Was starring back at what I'd seen for a long, long time
I had to break it
I had to clear my mind

This feeling just gets better all the time
So beautiful in front of me that I can't believe my eyes
I know it from move ahead time is one my side
I'm free from the circle
There'll be no regrets this time

Hard times that I like to forget about
So much I held inside
God let it out
It took a while to find it
But now I'm here and I can't deny it

This feeling just gets better all the time
So beautiful in front of me that I can't believe my eyes
I know it from move ahead time is one my side
I'm free from the circle
There'll be no regrets this time
