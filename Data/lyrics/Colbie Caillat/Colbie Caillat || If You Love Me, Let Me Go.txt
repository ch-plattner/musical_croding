
Waiting here for my phone to ring, phone to ring wondering
Are you ever coming back to me again?
Counting every drop of rain, drop of rain falling
Falling down into the hole you dug for me
And it buried me, 'cause you dug so deep
But I'm still within your reach

Oh, oh
If you really loved me, you would let me go, oh
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really loved me, you would let me go
If you love me, let me go

Every time you come back again, back again the healing ends
I push all of my rules aside for you
You should see the way other eyes, other eyes fight for me
They give me everything that you never do
Still it tears at me, 'cause you cut so deep
And I'm still within your reach

Oh, oh
If you really loved me, you would let me go, oh
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really loved me, you would let me go
If you love me, let me go

All of me, all of me
Wants to be with you, but you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
All of me, all of me
Wants to be with you, but you
Let me bleed, let me bleed

Oh, oh
If you really loved me, you would let me go, oh
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really loved me, you would let me go
If you love me, let me go
If you love me, let me go
