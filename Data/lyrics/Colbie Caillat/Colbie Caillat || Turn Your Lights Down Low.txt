
Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtain
Oh, let moon come shining in
Into our life again

Saying Oh, itÂ´s been a long, long time
I got this message for you boy
But it seems I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you boy?
On time, on time

I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good loving
Oh I, Oh I, Oh I, I wanna give you some good, good loving

Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, Oh no
Just let your love come shining in
Into our lives again

Saying Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
And I want you to know right now
Oh, I love you
And I want you to know right now
That I, that I

I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good loving
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh, I wanna to give you some good, good loving

Saying Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
And I want you to know right now
Oh, I love you
And I want you to know right now
That I, that I

I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good loving
Oh I, Oh I, I wanna give you some good, good loving
I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good loving
I wanna give you some good, good loving
