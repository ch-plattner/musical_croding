No, no, I, I, I, I, I don't want to break when I speak
I don't want to shake while I'm standing
I don't want to crawl into another hole
I don't know what I'm hiding for
No, I, I, I, I, I don't want to fall when I stand
I don't want to have to hold your hand
I just want to be the girl i used to be when i was me and worry-free
I know these burdens are my own

[Chorus:]
But I can't keep on running
No I just can't keep on running away from here
I know that the only way to beat it is by fighting my every fear
I'm not going to make it 'til I turn around and face it alone, I know
I can't just keep running, no I just can't keep on running away
So it stops today

So here I am, I'm taking my first step
Thought I was losing balance but I caught myself
I kind of like the challenge, no I don't need help
I'm going to make it past the very start
It's always been my hardest part

But I, I, I, I, I'm going to stay in control
I must admit this crutch is getting old
I am going to throw it right out of my hand
I'm finally here, I understand
I know I'll get there on my own

[Chorus]

You can hide from all the pain
But it will find you anyway
Yes, I know, now I know

[Chorus]
