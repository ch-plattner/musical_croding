
Bleeding thoughts 
Cracking boulder 
Don't fall over 

Fake your laughter 
Burn the tear 
Sing it louder 
Twist and shout 

Way up here 
We stand on shoulders 
Growing colder 

Laugh or cry 
I won't mind 
Sing it louder 
Twist and shout 

Immovable shadows 
The concrete girl 
They'll rock your world to nothing 

And they're swimming around again, again 
And they're swimming around 
The concrete girl 

Catch your breath like four-leaf clover 
Hand it over 

Scream to no one 
Take your time 
Sing it louder 
Twist and shout 

Nothing to run from is worse than something 
And all your fears of nothing 

And they're swimming around again, again 
And they're swimming around 
The concrete girl 

Concrete girl don't fall down 
In this broken world around you 
Concrete girl don't fall down 
Don't fall down my concrete girl 

Don't stop thinking 
Don't stop feeling now 

One step away from where we were 
And one step back to nothing 

And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears 
And we're fighting for words now concrete girl 
And we're swimming around again, again 
And we're swimming around now 
Concrete girl 

Concrete girl don't fall down in this broken world around you
Concrete girl don't fall down
Don't fall down my concrete girl

Concrete girl don't fall down in this concrete world around you
Concrete girl don't fall down
Don't break down my concrete girl
