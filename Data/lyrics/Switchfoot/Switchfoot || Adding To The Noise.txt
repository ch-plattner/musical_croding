What's it gonna take 
to slow us down 
to let the silence spin us around? 
What's it gonna take 
to drop this town? 
We've been spinning at the speed of sound. 

Stepping out of those convenience stores 
what could we want but more more more? 
From the third world 
to the corporate core 
we are a symphony of modern humanity 

If we're adding to the noise 
turn off this song 
If we're adding to the noise 
turn off your stereo, radio, video

I dont know 
what they're gonna think of next 
genetic engineers of the most high tech 
A couple new ways 
to fall into debt 
I'm a nervous wreck but I'll bet 
that that T.V. set 
tells us what we've wanted to hear 
But none of these sound bites 
are coming in clear 
From the third world to the corporate ear 
we are the symphony of modern humanity.
