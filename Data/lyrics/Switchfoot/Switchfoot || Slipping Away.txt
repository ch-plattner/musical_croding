
Remember coming home at four in the morning
Before the sun was up
Back when the east was a fire of gold
Just waiting for the rest of the sky to fall in love

Our hope is just a metaphor, of something better
For all of our dreams tonight
And fear is just a shadow of the things that matter the most
And I fear that I'm losing hope tonight

Oh oh
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh oh
Staring up at the ceiling
Oh oh
It's four in the morning
I can't sleep and it feels like a warning
Oh oh
You wouldn't believe me
If I could say it just the way that I'm feeling
Oh oh
The words that I wanted to say
I feel them slipping away

Remember that kid with the quivering lip
Whose heart was on his sleeve like a first aid kit
Where are you now? Where are you now?

Remember that kid, didn't know when to quit
I still lose my breath when I think about it
Oh, where'd you go?
(Oh where'd you go?)

Oh oh
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh oh
Staring up at the ceiling
Oh oh
It's four in the morning
I can't sleep and it feels like a warning
Oh oh
You wouldn't believe me
If I could say it just the way that I'm feeling
Oh oh
The words that I wanted to say
I feel them slipping away

I know this isn't what you wanted
Past words in the present are haunting us now
And on and on and on and on
My heartbeat could tell you it's urgent
I try to shout but the words don't come out
I feel I'm slipping away

Oh oh
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh oh
Staring up at the ceiling
Oh oh
It's four in the morning
I can't sleep and it feels like a warning
Oh oh
You wouldn't believe me
If I could say it just the way that I'm feeling
Oh oh
The words that I wanted to say
I feel them slipping away
