
Keep, keep, keep
Keep pushing this higher
I've been living uptight
(Take it easy right now)
Like a moth to the fire
Like I'm losing this fight
(Take it easy right now)

From the day we're born
We are scarred and torn
We've been scared to sing out loud

But we don't care no more
'Cause we know life is short
We don't care who hears us now
Breathe it in and let it out

Let it out
(Breathe it in and) let it out
Let it out

Got, got, got
Got me walking on a wire
Got me shaking at night
(Take it easy right now)
When my soul gets tired
Feel like I'm losing that fight
(Take it easy right now)

From the day we're born
We are scarred and torn
We've been scared to sing out loud

But we don't care no more
'Cause we know life is short
We don't care who hears us now
Breathe it in and let it out

Let it out
(Breathe it in and) let it out
Let it out

Yeah, come on, let it out

Are you holding on?
Are you up against those ropes?
Cause I know how it feels to lose hope
Are you holding in?
Well come on, let it out

Take a breath and let it out

From the day we're born
We are scarred and torn
We've been scared to sing out loud

But we don't care no more
'Cause we know life is short
We don't care who hears us now
Breathe it in and let it out

Let it out
Let it out
Yeah, c'mon, let it out
Let it out
Let it out

Breathe it in and let it out
