Everything I ever need to know 
I learned at the Punk Rock show
The Punks should know
How to through an elbow or a fist
A spinning world of hit and miss
Of violent bliss

But hold on hold on
I'll never be quite punk enough
But hold on hold on
I'll never be quite punk enough for you

Ever since I first learned how to spit
I wished I were a punk rock kid
A punk rock kid
I never eally knew quite what to do
I'll never be as punk as you
As punk as you
As punk as you and your tattoo

But hold on hold on
Punk is more than leather jackets
Hold on hold 
Punk is dead but pop was never cool
What we gonna do?
