
When success is equated with excess
The ambition for excess wrecks us
As top of the mind becomes the bottom line 
When success is equated with excess

If your time ain't been nothing for money 
I start to feel really bad for you, honey 
Maybe honey, put your money where your mouth's been running 
If your time ain't been nothing but money

I want out of this machine
It doesn't feel like freedom

This ain't my American dream
I want to live and die for bigger things 
I'm tired of fighting for just me 
This ain't my American dream

When success is equated with excess
When we're fighting for the Beamer, the Lexus 
As the heart and soul breath in the company goals 
Where success is equated with excess

'Cause baby's always talkin' 'bout a ring 
And talk has always been the cheapest thing 
Is it true would you do what I want you to 
If I show up with the right amount of bling?

Like a puppet on a monetary string
Maybe we've been caught singing
Red, white, blue, and green
But that ain't my America,
That ain't my American dream
