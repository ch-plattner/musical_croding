
A feeling comes to me in waves
The darkest seas I’ve ever known
Mine is an odyssey of grace
Mine is a story headed home

I tie myself up to the mast
Give up the semblance of control
The sirens sing but I let them pass
Coz only you could free my soul

Only you could free my soul, hey
Only you could free my soul, he-hey

Set these broken bones to cast
Stitch my wounds with holy sutures
Every saint has got a past
But every sinner’s got a future

Only you could free my soul, he-hey
Only you could free my soul, yeahh

Show me the freedom from these chains
Show me a battlefield that saves
That world is still a world away
But you are my liberty

Free my soul, free my soul
And let liberty flow 
Like a flood, let it go
And I’ll let the past go
I’ve come running back home
And I’ll make it, I know
All my love, all my hope
Only you could free my soul
Come on, free my soul
Only you could free my soul

I tie myself up to the mast
I tie myself up to the mast
And let it go

Only you could free my soul
