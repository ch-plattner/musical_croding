
Yeah 

I hear you breathing in 
Another day begins 
The stars are falling out 
My dreams are fading now, fading out 

I've been keeping my eyes wide open 
I've been keeping my eyes wide open 

Your love is a symphony 
All around me 
Running through me 
Your love is a melody 
Underneath me 
Running to me 

Oh, your love is a song 

The dawn is fire bright 
Against the city lights 
The clouds are glowing now 
The moon is blacking out, is blacking out 

So I've been keeping my mind wide open 
I've been keeping my mind wide open, yeah 

Your love is a symphony 
All around me 
Running through me 
Your love is a melody 
Underneath me 
Running to me 

Oh, your love is a song 
Your love is a song 
Oh, your love is a song 
Your love is strong 

With my eyes wide open 
I've got my eyes wide open 
I've been keeping my hopes unbroken, yeah 

Your love is a symphony 
All around me 
Running through me 
Your love is a melody 
Underneath me 
Running to me 

Your love is a song 
Yeah, yeah 
Your love is my remedy 
Oh your love is a song
