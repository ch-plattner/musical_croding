
I want to sing one for all the dreamers
I'm singing this one for the sparks
Here's one for the friction makers
We are the bleeding hearts
Don't care whoever you are

We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?

I want to turn up the radiation
I want to glow in the dark
Love is the one true innovation
Love is the only art
Don't let 'em blow it apart

We are the children of the scar
I want to start from the start
