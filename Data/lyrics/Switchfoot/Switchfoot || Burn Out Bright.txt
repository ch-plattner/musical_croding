Does it have to start with a broken heart 
Broken dreams and bleeding parts 
We were young and world was clear 
But young ambition disappears 
I swore it would never come to this 
The average, the obvious

I'm still discontented down here
I'm still discontented

If we've only got one try
If we've only got one life
If time was never on our side
Then before I die
I want to burn out bright

A spark ignites
In time and space
Limping through this human race
You bite and claw your way back home 
But you're running the wrong way

The future is a question mark
Of kerosene and electric sparks
There's still fire in you yet
Yeah there's still fire in you!

I keep cleaning up the mess I've made 
I won't run away 
I can't sleep in the bed I've made
