Their old lies never could come true
Hey boy, don't believe them
Everything that they told you to
Hey boy, don't believe them
We're the nation that eats our youth
Hey boy, don't believe them
None of us are bulletproof
Yeah

Deep down there's a boy inside
Asleep, waiting for the sun to rise
Wake up, wake up

Still looking for the blinding light
Still looking for the reason why
Still looking for the sun to shine
Take me higher and higher
All my life I've been living in the darkest night
Still looking for the blinding light
To take me higher and higher

Hey girl, be yourself now
Don't believe what they told you to
Hey girl, be yourself now
Your skin's more than a pin-up suit
Hey girl, don't conform now
No one else's got soul like you
Hey girl, you're a strong one
But none of us are bulletproof
Yeah

Deep down there's a hope inside
You got wings but you're scared to fly
Wake up, wake up

Still looking for the blinding light
Still looking for the reason why
Still looking for the sun to shine
Take me higher and higher
All my life I've been living in the darkest night
Still looking for the sun to shine
Take me higher and higher

Deep down there's a hope inside
Brighter than the fears in my mind
I keep looking for the blinding light
It's a hope that keeps me alive
Wake up, wake up

Keep looking for the blinding light
Keep looking for the reason why
Keep looking for the sun to shine
Take me higher and higher
All my life I've been living in the darkest night
Still looking for the sun to rise
To take me higher and higher

Blinding light, the blinding light
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
To take me higher and higher
Blinding light, you're the vision that gives me sight
All the blinding light, take me higher and higher
