When I wake in the morning
I want to blow into pieces
I want more than just ok, more than just ok
When I'm up with the sunrise
I want more than just blue skies
I want more than just ok, more than just ok

I'm not giving up, giving up, not giving up now
I'm not giving up, giving up, not backing down

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just ok

When I'm lit with the sunshine
I want more than just a good time
I want more than just ok, more than just ok

I'm not giving up, giving up, not giving up now
I'm not giving up, giving up, not selling out

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just ok
More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just ok

More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from who we are
More than oceans, more than oceans, yeah

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just ok
More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just ok
