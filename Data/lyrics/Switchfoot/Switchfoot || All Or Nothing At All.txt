
I can't say I didn't see it coming
I pushed the pedal and we hit the wall
I can't say I don't want nothing
I want it all, or nothing at all

I should've known, should've known better
I can't say I didn't see you fall
I won't settle for your love letters
I want it all or nothing at all

You feel your heart beat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all

There's a fault line here running
The walls shake like a cannonball
So fight fair if you love something
Yeah, but I'm sick of fighting at all

I can't say that I don't get it
I want it all or nothing at all

You feel your heart beat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all

All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
Eh, we won't stop till we're getting it right
All or nothing at all
Eh eh we won't stop till we're getting it right
Yea yea yea, now I know, now I know better
Eh eh we won't stop till we're getting it right
Eh eh
I want it all or nothing at all

You feel your heart beat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all

All or nothing at all
All or nothing, all or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
