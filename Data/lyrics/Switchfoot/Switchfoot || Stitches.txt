I'm not the only one who sees them
I'm not the only one they keep up at night
I'm not the only one not sleeping
I'm not the only one who's dreaming out loud
Dreaming out

In stitches here tonight
We are ripping the seams
I'm pushing hard to tear it loose
In stitches here tonight
We are ripping the seams
There's something missing
Children of the in-between

[repeat]
