
Augustine
Just woke up with a broken heart
All this time
He's never been awake before

At thirty-one
His whole world is a question mark
All this time
He's never been awake before

Watching dreams that he once had
Feed the flame inside his head
In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says...

"There's got to be something more
Than what I'm living for
I'm crying out to You"

Augustine
All his fears keep falling out
All this time
He's never been awake before

Finding now
His old dreams aren't panning out
All this time
He's never been awake before

But he's mad to be alive
And he's dying to be met
In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says...

"Hey, I give it all away
Nothing I was holding back remains
Hey, I give it all away
Looking for the grace of God today"
