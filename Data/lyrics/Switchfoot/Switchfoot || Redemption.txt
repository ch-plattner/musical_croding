Four A.M. two hours to go
I'm wearing out a lonely glow.
I miss you more than I could know.
Here I am, here I am,
won't you get me?

I've got my hands on redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine.
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
and I'll come alive.

With my fist down at your feet 
I was running out of mysteries 
Insecure and incomplete, here I am, here I am, 
won't you get me? 

My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me, worn me.
