Put your hands up, open wide
Put your hands up, side by side
Age don't matter like
Race don't matter like
Place don't matter like what's inside

Let the kick drum kick one time
Breathe out let your mind unwind
Eyes on the ceiling
Looking for the feeling
Wide open let your own eyes shine

Yeah, it's where the fight begins
Yeah, underneath the skin
Beneath these hopes and where we've been
Every fight comes from the fight within

I am the war inside
I am the battle line
I am the rising tide
I am the war I fight
Eyes open, open wide
I can feel like a crack in my spine
I can feel like the back of my mind
I am the war inside

I get the feeling that we're living in sci-fi
I get the feeling that our weapons are low-fi
Ain't no killer like pride
No killer like I
No killer like what's inside

Yeah, it's in the air we breathe
Yeah, it's in the blood we bleed
Beneath these dreams and what we've seen
We are the kids of the in-between

I am the war inside
I am the battle line
I am the rising tide
I am the war I fight
Eyes open, open wide
I can feel it like a crack in my spine
I can feel it like the back of my mind

I am the war inside [x5]

Put your hands up open up wide
Put your hands up side by side
Age don't matter like
Race don't matter like
Place don't matter like what's inside

Yeah, every thought or deed
Yeah, every tree or seed
The big things come from the little dreams

Every world is made by make believe

I am the war inside
I am the battle line
I am the rising tide
I am the war I fight
Eyes open, open wide
I can feel it like a crack in my spine
I can feel it like the back of my mind

I am the war inside [x9]
