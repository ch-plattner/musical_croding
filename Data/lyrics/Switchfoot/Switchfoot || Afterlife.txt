
I've tasted fire I'm ready to come alive
I can't just shut it up and fake that I'm alright
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

I'll let it burn the way the sunlight burns my skin
The way I feel inside, the way the day begins
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the other side
I'm ready now, I'm ready now

Cause everyday the world is made
A chance to change But I feel the same
And I wonder
Why would I wait till I die to come alive?
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

I still believe we could live forever
You and I we begin forever now
Forever now
Forever

I still believe in us together
You and I we're here together now
Forever now
Forever now
Or never now

Cause everyday the world is made
A chance to change But I feel the same
And I wonder
Why would I wait till I die to come alive?
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

Everyday
A choice is made
Everyday
I choose my fate

And I wonder
Why would I wait till I die to come alive?

Everyday I still feel the same
And I wonder why would I wait till I die to come alive?
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

I'm ready now
I'm not waiting till the afterlife
