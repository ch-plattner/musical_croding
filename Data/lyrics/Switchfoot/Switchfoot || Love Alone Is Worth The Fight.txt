
I'm trying to find where my place is 
I'm looking for my own oasis 
So close I can taste this 
The fear that love alone erases 

So I'm back to the basics 
I figure it's time I face this 
Time to take my own advice 

Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight 

And I never thought it'd come to this 
But it seems like I'm finally feeling numb to this 
The funny thing about a name is 
You forget what the reason you were playing the game is 

And it's all an illusion 
A 21st century institution 
So I'm headed down the open road unknown 

And we find what we're made of 
Through the open door 
Is it fear you're afraid of? 
What are you waiting for? 

Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight

We're only here for a season 
I'm looking for the rhyme and reason 
Why you're born, why you're leaving 
What you fear and what you believe in 

Why you're living and breathing 
Why you're fighting it and getting it even 
Let's go headed down the open road unknown 

And we find what we're made of 
Through the open door 
Is it fear you're afraid of? 
What are you waiting for? 

Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight 

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh! Oh! 

Here we are, here we go 
Where the road is our own 
Hear it calling you home 
Here we are, here we go! 

Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight 
Love alone is worth the fight
