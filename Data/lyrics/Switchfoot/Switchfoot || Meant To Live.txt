Fumbling his confidence 
And wondering why the world has passed him by 
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments 
And failed attempts to fly, fly 

[Chorus]
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
Somewhere we live inside 
Somewhere we live inside 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
Somewhere we live inside 

Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries 
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open 
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken 

[Chorus] 

We want more than this world's got to offer 
We want more than this world's got to offer 
We want more than the wars of our fathers 
And everything inside screams for second life, yeah

We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live 
We were meant to live
