
Under the floor
Between me and the door
There's a presence
I cannot deny

It's under the car
Between me and the stars
I see glory filling up the sky

And I'm certain that he hears me
He listens even as I sing my song
I'm emphatic that he's near me
And I can see his touch in everything here

Deep is the soul
Is the space I control
Is the one thing I can call as mine

Deeper the cold
When he's far from my soul
I surrender all of me inside
