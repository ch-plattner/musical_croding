
I've got my back against the wall
But I still hear the blue sky call
The chains that hold me back inside
Are the prisons of my mind

Free, come set me free
Down on my knees
I still believe
You can save me from me

Come set me free
Come set me free
Inside this shell
There's a prison cell

I try to live the light of day
Why would I do what I hate?
But when try to reach above
I only I hurt the ones I love

There's a hole in the neighborhood
Where the shadows fall
There's a hole in my heart but my hope
Is not in me at all

I had a dream that my chains were broken
Broken, broken, broken open
Free
