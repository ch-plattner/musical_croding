
(In this needle and haystack life)

The road begins with new born skin
We are right now
You're a needle girl, in a haystack world
We are right now

You're breathing in
The highs and lows
We call it living

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime, ooh

Don't let go
Don't give up hope
All is forgiven

You're breathing in
You're breathing in
We call it living

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

All is not lost
All is not lost
Become who you are
It happens once in a lifetime

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

Alive
We are once in lifetime
In this needle and haystack
(We are once in a lifetime)
