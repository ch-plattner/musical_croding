I'm the failure
I'm everyone's fool
And I'm losing my cool at the end

I'm the loser
My numbers come up
I've been hung up with thoughts of Revenge
Revenge
Revenge

Oh!!!!

I've been watching you with my terminal view
As you struggle to rise to your end
I laughed hard at the insults we through
As the weight of the world found revenge
Revenge
Revenge

Oh!

Have hatred and Gravity won?

Oh!
Oh!

The world hung upsidedown
I drew first blood [2x]
With my hateful recrown
I drew first blood [2x]
Revenge

I watched heaven dying today
and I'm gonna die here tonight
I'm the villian and I deserve to be dead
I've been hung up for recking my life
Revenge [2x]

Oh!

So I stopped for a moment
to look at the sun
dying today
That's when the irony hit me
That this was revenge
That love had decended and stolen our pain
Away.

We consumed heaven's Son
And I drew first blood [2x]
And my hate was undone
And I drew first blood [2x]
Revenge

Here's a story
How thief had been robed
How murder had stolen my rage
Think of me Lord
I'm a few breaths away
As my lungs finally rip from the cage

Revenge.

OH!!!!!!!!
