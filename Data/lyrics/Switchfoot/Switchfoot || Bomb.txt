
with blankness starring back at me
and screaming from the pages
i feel the fear of apathy 
gripping me, pushing me
on top of everything
in the corner with a view
i turn off the fluorescent tubes

this is the bomb that i've been waiting for (looking for)
you finally lit the fuse
thats in my head
yes, you finally lit the fuse
thats in my head

with nothingness on top of me
and bleeding from my folder
who can stop the emptiness
don't let it take me over

i've been sinking down 
further into nothing
ive been waiting long 
longer than for some things

this is the bomb that i've been waiting for (living for)
you finally lit the fuse
thats in my head
yes, you finally lit the fuse
thats in my head
and you finally lit the fuse 
thats in my head
yes, you finally lit the fuse 
thats in my head
