
What's your direction?
Tell me what's wrong, tell me what's right 
What's your direction?
Think about somebody else for the night
Life's more than girls 
God's more than words 
You're more than this 
So what's your direction? 
And where are you now? 

Grow, grow where you are 
Anchor your roots underneath 
Doubt your doubts and believe your beliefs 

What's your direction? 
What matters most?  
What should you know?
What's your direction
All that you've been 
Makes who you are now 
'Cause I've been ashamed 
I've been a fool 
You know I've backed down 
When I lose direction I pray to be found 

Grow, grow where you are
Anchor your roots underneath
Doubt your doubts and believe your beliefs
