{Ya I will im just gonna sing this track first}

Ive seen the darkest things
crawling inside of me
ive seen the monsters come alive
ive seen the enemy
the nightmare follows me
searching the darkness for a light

Waiting for daylight to break up this room
waiting for daylight to break
Ive been alone in the dark
Ive been dreaming
Now im waking up without you
Ive been waking up without you for too long

back in the tragedy
Ive made a mess of me
my bitter means my bitter ends
ive seen the irony
it gets the best of me
dying to be made new again

Waiting for daylight to break up this room
waiting for daylight to break
Ive been alone in the dark
Ive been dreaming the day when dreamers are awake
The sun hits my eyes and everythings alright
Ive been waking up without you 
ive been waking up without you
ive been roaring at arms till you were in my arms
ive been waking without you 
ive been waking up without you for too long

Waiting for to daylight to break up the room
waiting, waiting
ive been alone in the dark 
ive been dreaming the day when dreamers are awake
the sun hits my eyes and everything alright
Ive been waking up without you
ive been waking up without you
ive been roaring at arms till you were in my arms
ive been waking up without you
ive been waking up without you for too long
