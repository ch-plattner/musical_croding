The wasteland is mine, mine alone
The desert comes alive, when no one is home
Apocalyptic skies, burning gold
I walk these empty miles, I can't find a soul

In my mind
In my mind
In my mind, I'm miles away
I'm miles away

I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid to be free
I'm not afraid to doubt, I'm afraid to believe
Don't believe the lies, of what you see
Elevate your mind above these animal dreams

In my mind
In my mind
In my mind, I'm miles away
I'm miles away

Flying overhead, these animal dreams
Flying overhead, these animal dreams
Flying overhead, these animal dreams
Flying overhead, these animal dreams

In my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind
