
I want a fire that could burn me clean
Light the sky with my black-eyed dreams
And let my soul fly
And let my soul fly

I want a fire burning down the door
Let the wounds of my embers soar
And let my soul fly
And let my soul fly

Let it go
Yeah, let it go

Pavement beneath my feet
I watch the white lines fly
Nothing between us here but the black blue sky
Suspended up in the air, like a still life
Yeah, we're suspended up into the air, like a still life
Let it go
Let it go

I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean
I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean

And let my soul fly
And let my soul fly

Pavement beneath my feet
I watch the white lines fly
I want a fire that could burn me clean
I want a fire that could burn me clean
And let it go
