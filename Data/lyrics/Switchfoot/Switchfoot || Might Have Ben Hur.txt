
Everything I know 
Tells me she's everything 
That I could hope for 
Everything I know 
Tells me I can't let her walk away 

[bridge:]
I took my time to find the words 
I hope she'd feel the same 

[chorus:]
'Cause I want someone to share my smile 
To share the pain 
To be there when the sea turns gray 
To share the joy 
For better or worse 
And I thought that it might have been her 
I thought that it might have been her 

Wonder if she knows 
The way I saw her soul 
Light up my life 
Wonder if she knows 
of the pain I feel tonight
