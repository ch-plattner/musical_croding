
Oh, I'm a wandering soul
I'm still walking the line
That leads me home alone

All I know
I still got mountain to climb
On my own, on my own

Do you love me enough to let me go?
To let me follow through
To let me fall for you
Do you love me enough to let me go?

Back from the dead of winter
Back from the dead and all our leaves are dry
You're so beautiful, tonight

Back from the dead we went through
Back from the dead and both our tongues are tied
You look beautiful tonight

But every seed dies before it grows

Breathe it in and let it go
Every breath you take is not your to own
It's not your to hold
Do you love me enough to let me go?
