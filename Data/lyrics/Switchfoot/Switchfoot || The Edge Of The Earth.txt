
When the morning finds us
We open up our eyes
With the stars still fading in the sky 
All along the journey
You leave the past behind 
I had a dream that we could fly

Over distant oceans
The fallen mountains
The great wide open of the desert sky
And where I'll be is where you find me
Meet me here at the edge of the earth
Meet me here at the edge of the earth
So come on
Come on

So I set off running
To reach the other side
To find a place to call my own
There in the distance the rivers open wide
And I was lost but not alone

Over distant oceans
The fallen mountains
The great wide open of the desert sky
And where I'll be is where you found me
Meet me here at the edge of the earth
Meet me here at the edge of the earth
So come on
