
I start the day against the voices
The ones that tell me that I'm wrong
I hear them now, screaming their delusions
I close my eyes and they're gone

In my mind I hear the voices
In my mind I have my doubts
Burning fears, these ghosts and apparitions
Oh may a whisper can drown them out

If they ain't singing
If they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is the fight to by yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else
Someone else

I start the road against the voices
I picked a path out in the woods
I made mistakes, I've got the scars to prove them
I'd change the past if I could

If they ain't singing
If they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows 
That the hardest war to fight
Is the fight to be yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else

I close my eyes and they're gone
Gone, gone

If they ain't singing
If they're just talking 
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows 
That the hardest war to fight
Is the fight to by yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else

Let them keep talking to themselves
Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is the fight to be yourself
I close my eyes and they're gone
