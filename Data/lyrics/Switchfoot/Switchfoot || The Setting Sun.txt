Hey!
(Hey, hey)

Yeah, Yeah (Yeah!)

Yeah, Yeah (Yeah!)

I've got a wound that doesn't heal,
Burning out again,
Burning out again

I've not sure which of me is real,
And I'm alone again,
Burning out again

My hope runs underneath it all,
The day that I'll be home

It won't be long, I belong,
Somewhere past the setting sun

finally free, finally strong,
Somewhere back where I belong

Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)
Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)

They're selling shares of me again,
But I'm not buying it,
I'm not buying it

My wound goes deeper than the skin,
There's no hiding it,
So I'm not trying it

My hope runs underneath it all,
The day that I'll be home,

It won't be long, I belong,
Somewhere past the setting sun,
finally free, finally strong,
Somewhere back where I belong

Yeah, Yeah, (Somewhere past the setting sun!)

Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)

Yeah, Yeah, (Going back where we belong!)

Yeah, Yeah, (I'll find you)
(The setting sun!)

Let the weak say I am strong, and it won't be long,
Let the right say I was wrong, and it won't be wrong,
Let us find where we belong,
Beyond the setting sun,
Beyond the setting sun

Yeah, Yeah

It won't be long, I belong,
Somewhere past the setting sun,
finally free, finally strong,
Somewhere back where I belong

Yeah, Yeah (Yeah, Yeah!)

Yeah, Yeah (Yeah, Yeah!)
