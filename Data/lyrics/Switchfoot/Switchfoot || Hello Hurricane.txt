Ohhh yeah yeah ohhh 

I've been watching the skies 
They've been turning blood red 
Not a doubt in my mind anymore 
There's a storm up ahead 

Hello hurricane 
You're not enough 
Hello hurricane 
You can't silence my love 
I've got doors and windows 
Boarded up 
All your dead end fury is 
Not enough 
You can't silence my love, my love 

Every thing I have I count as loss 
Everything I have is stripped away 
Before I started building 
I counted up these costs 
There's nothing left for you to take away 

Hello hurricane 
You're not enough 
Hello hurricane 
You can't silence my love 
I've got doors and windows 
Boarded up 
All your dead end fury is 
Not enough 
You can't silence my love 
Yeah my love 

I'm on fire fighting for control 
I'm a fighter fighting for my soul 
Everything inside of me surrenders 
You can't silence my love 
You can't silence my love 

Hello hurricane 
You're not enough 
Hello hurricane 
You can't silence my love 
I've got doors and windows 
Boarded up 
All your dead end fury is 
Not enough 
You can't silence my love 

Yeah I said hello hurricane
