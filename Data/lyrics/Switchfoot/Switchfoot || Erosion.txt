
Rain is a bad reminder of everything I don't want to know
Rain is a backseat driver that takes me where I don't want to go
And it looks like the sky is caving in again
I'm dry and cracked, the sky goes black
And tut, tut, it looks like rain
Erosion
Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make
Me whole

The thirstiest grounds can't take the rain
My undecided vices washing on down the drain
And it looks like the sky is caving in again
My heart is cracked, the sky goes black
And tut, tut, it looks like rain

Oh, erosion, would You wash away my sins?
Oh, erosion, I need a second shot again
Oh, erosion, would You break my heart again?
Oh, erosion, I am a broken-hearted man
