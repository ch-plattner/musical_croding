Got your hands in your pockets
Like you're ready to pay
Got your eyes out of socket
Like you're a mile away
Mouth shut like a locket
Like you've nothing to say

Speak your mind up
Come on baby free yourself

Free yourself
Ain't no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain't nothing to it
Free yourself
Don't let nobody try and take your soul
You're the original

So you say you're just a lost soul
I know you better than that
So you say you're just lost in the wash
I know you better than that
So you say you're just a face in city race
Wasted and sick of it all

Speak your mind up
Come on baby free yourself

Free yourself
Ain't no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain't nothing to it
Free yourself
Don't let nobody try and take your soul
You're the original
