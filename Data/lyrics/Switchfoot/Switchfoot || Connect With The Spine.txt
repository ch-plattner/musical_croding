
Take her like a photograph
Like any autograph
She'll find a way to go down
Watch her like a movie screen
Like any drama queen
She'll find a way to go down

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Play it like a cameo
And watch her overflow
She'll find a way to go down
Running like a candidate
Like any minute made
You'll find a way to go down

I'm sick of the faces, the scene, and the light
We'll be fine when the faces connect with the spine

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
