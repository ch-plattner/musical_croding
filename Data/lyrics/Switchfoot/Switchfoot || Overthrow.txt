All our pretty roads, fairy tales and crowns, broken on the floor
All our little words, love and peace and love, spoken with a sword
We say overthrow the government, put a new one up instead

If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow your soul
If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow your soul

Tell me how it goes, the one about the war,
the war that killed the king
Our hearts are still the same, stone and ice and steal
Lifeless hollow things
You say overthrow the government, who will save us from yourself?

If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow your soul
If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow yourself, yourself, yourself

Take me down and lock me up, 
you can't change my head, 
you can't change my heart
When this old life is done, 
will we still be the stubborn souls we always were?
Today is our last change to turn around, to turn around
Yourself, yourself, yourself

If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow your soul
If you can overthrow then overthrow,
If you can overthrow your soul
