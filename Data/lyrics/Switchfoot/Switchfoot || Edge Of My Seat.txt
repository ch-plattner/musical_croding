Nothing more 
That there's nothing more 
Nothing more
That there's nothing more

Nothing here's the same, it's all a dream 
Life on the movie screen 
And I'm sitting on the edge of my seat 

I can't tell what happens next,
Just what I've seen 
I don't know what it means 
But I'm holding on the edge of my seat 

[CHORUS:]
'Cause I can't forget your name,
Forget your name 
Yeah I can't forget you now 
I know I can't forget you, girl 

I promise 
Sit back buckle in and hold on tight 
A roller coaster ride 
And I'm holding on the edge of my seat 

And I can't know for sure 
'Cause I just landed on your shore 
But I think you got nothing but another thing coming 
If you think there's nothing more 
That there's nothing more 

Chorus [3x]
