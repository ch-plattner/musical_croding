
All attempts have failed 
All my heads are tails 
She's got teary eyes 
I've got reasons why 

I'm losing ground and gaining speed 
I've lost myself or most of me 
I'm headed for the final precipice 

But you haven't lost me yet 
No, you haven't lost me yet 
I'll sing until my heart caves in 
No, you haven't lost me yet 

These days pass me by 
I dream with open eyes 
Nightmares haunt my days 
Visions blur my nights 

I'm so confused 
What's true of false 
What's fact or fiction after all 
I feel like I'm an apparition's pet 

But you haven't lost me yet 
No you haven't lost me yet 
I'll run until my heart caves in 
No, you haven't lost me yet 

If it doesn't break 
If it doesn't break 
If it doesn't break 
If it doesn't break your heart 
It isn't love 
If it doesn't break your heart 
It's not enough 
It's when you're breaking down 
With your insides coming out 
That's when you find out what your heart is made of 

And you haven't lost me yet but 
No you haven't lost me yet 
I'll sing until my heart caves in 
No, you haven't lost me yet 
Cause you haven't lost me yet
