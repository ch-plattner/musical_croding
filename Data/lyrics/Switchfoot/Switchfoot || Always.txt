
This is the start, this is your heart
This is the day you were born
This is the sun, these are your lungs
This is the day you were born

And I am always yours

These are the scars deep in your heart
This is the place you were born
This is the hole where most of your soul comes ripping out
From the places you've been torn

And it is always yours
But I am always yours

Hallelujah, I'm caving in
Hallelujah, I'm in love again
Hallelujah, I'm a wretched man
Hallelujah, every breath is a second chance

And it is always yours
And I am always yours
