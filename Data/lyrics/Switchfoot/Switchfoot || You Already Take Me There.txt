
When all I have is on the floor
Divided, divided
When I'm a world away from peace
Behind Your eyes is where I know
I'll find it, I'll find it
Cause who You are defines my dreams

You already take me there
Heaven in the here and now

When I'm a broken-hearted man
Complacent and tired
When I've been knocked out of the race
I've been a fool for long enough
To fight it, to fight it
It's in Your arms I find my place

You meet me where I am
Forgive where I am

Where I lose myself in grace
(Where I'm lost and found)
I want to lose myself in grace
Let Your love reign down all over me
Cover me
