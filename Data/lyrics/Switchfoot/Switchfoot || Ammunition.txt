
Blame it on what you've been through
Blame it on what you're into
Blame it on your religions
Blame it on politicians

We've been blowing up
We're the issue
It's our condition

We've been blowing up
We're the issue
Our detonation

We've been blowing up
We're the issue
We're ammunition
We're ammunition
We're ammunition
We are the fuse and ammunition

I have no generation
Show me my motivation
One world one desperation
One hope and one salvation

Look what a mess we've made of love
Look what a mess we've made
We've got ourselves to blame
Look what a bomb we made of love
