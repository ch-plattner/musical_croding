
Fading West with you
Fading West with you

The sun goes down for the summer
Mirror sky for the water
I am fading westward too
Fading west with you

Life won't sing like I want it
The traffic post modern sonic
The traffic hums a dirty tune
Fading West with you

Heading back to the west coast
Where I'm from
I'm heading back to the left coast
Where I belong.
California's calling me back home
Fading West with you

Keep my mind over matter
Cause I've seen my hopes shatter
They told me lies I thought were true
Fading West with you

The sun goes down
We were already going 

Heading back to the west coast
Where I'm from
I'm heading back to the left coast
Where I belong.
California's calling me back home
Fading West with you

When I'm out on my own
Feel like I'm caving in
When you leave me alone
I start to wonder
Where have I been
Where have I been

Heading back to the west coast
Where I'm from
I'm heading back to the left coast
Where I belong.
California's calling me back home
Fading West with you

Fading West with you
Fading West with you
