
She told him she'd rather fix her makeup
Than try to fix what's going on
But the problem keeps on calling 
Even with the cellphone gone
She told him that she believes in living 
Bigger than she's living now
But her world keeps spinning backwards 
And upsidedown
Don't say so long, and throw yourself wrong
Don't spend today away
Cuz today will soon be 

Gone, like yesterday is gone, 
Like history is
Gone, just trying to prove me wrong 
And pretend like you're immortal

She said he said live like no tomorrow
Every day we borrow
Brings us one step closer to the edge (infinity)
Where's your treasure, where's your hope
If you get the world and lose your soul
She pretends like she pretends like she's immortal
Don't say so long
You're not that far gone
This could be your big chance to makeup 
Today will soon be

Gone, like yeterday is gone, 
Like history is gone,
The world keeps spinning on,
Your going going gone, 
Like summer break is gone,
Like saturday is gone
Just try to prove me wrong 
You pretend like your immortal your immortal

We are not infinite 
We are not permanent
Nothing is immediate
We're so confident 
In our accomplishments
Look at our decadence

Gone, like Frank Sinatra
Like Elvis and his mom
Like AL Pacino's cash nothing lasts in this life
My highschool dreams are gone
My childhood sweets are gone
Life is a day that doesn't last for long

Life is more than money 
Time was never money
Time was never cash,
Life is still more than girls 
Life is more than hundred dollar bills
And roto-tom fills
Life's more than fame and rock and roll and thrills
All the riches of the kings
End up in wills we got information in the information age
But do we know what life is 
Outside of our convenient Lexus cages

She said he said live like no tomorrow 
Every moment that we borrow
Brings us closer to the God who's not short of cash 
Hey Bono  i'm glad you asked
Life is still worth living, life is still worth living
