
Life and love and why 
Child, adult, then die 
All of your hoping 
And all of your searching 
For what? 
Ask me for what am I living 
Or what gives me strength 
That I'm willing to die for 

Take away from me 
This monstrosity 
'Cause my futile thinking's 
Not gonna solve nothing tonight 
Ask me for what am I living 
Or what gives me strength 
That I'm willing to die for 

Could it be this 
Could this be bliss 
Could it be all that 
I ever had missed 
Could it be true 
Can life be new 
And can I be used 
Can I be used 

Give me a reason 
For life and for death 
A reason for drowning 
While I hold my breath 
Something to laugh at 
A reason to cry 
With everyone hopeless 
And hoping for something 
To hope for 
Yeah, with something to hope for 

Could it be true 
Can life be new 
Could it be all that I am 
Is in You 
Could it be this 
Could it be bliss 
Can it be You 
Can it be You
