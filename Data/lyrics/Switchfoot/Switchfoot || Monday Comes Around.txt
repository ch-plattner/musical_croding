She's a girl with the weight of the world
On her big brown eyes
She's a girl who's been talking to herself to apologize

She'll never do it again she promised
But then she hasn't been all that honest
Can she trust herself to be herself
Or is she talking to herself again?

Hey, Friday, what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?
Hey, Friday, what you gonna do now?

When Monday comes around
When Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around

Monday comes wondering
Where do you run to find a second start?
Where do you go when you're broke and alone
And Friday falls apart

Yeah, yeah, all these questions are leaving her shaking
Can you be two girls in one?
Can your heart bend this much without breaking?
You know that you know
And you can never have it both ways

Hey, Friday, what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?
Hey, Friday, what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?

When Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around

Don't take it easy, don't take it easy
Who says somebody's giving and taking, giving and taking
Everybody's taking away
(Monday comes around)
Friday, Monday, comes around
