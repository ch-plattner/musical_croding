You've been having trouble staying asleep 
You been waking up at 4:12 
You roll the voices over in your head 
Then you try to put them neatly on the shelf

You watch the sun rise
You saw the darkness had no choice before the dawn 
With your own eyes 
And then you broke out laughing from a yawn

You said,
"I'm so sorry I've been so down.
I started doubting things could ever turn around.
And I began to believe that all we are is material.
It's nonsensical."

So you walk outside and everything's new 
You're looking at the world with new eyes. 
As if you'd never seen a sky before that's blue  
As if you've never seen the sky in your whole life 
And then the phone rings 
As it turns out you are already late 
And now you're wondering 
Was peace just a temporary state?

You're waiting tables and parking cars
You've been selling cell phones at the shopping mall 
And you began to believe that all you are is material 
It's nonsensical

I still can't believe that all we are
And that all of are dreams are nothing more than material

Souls aren't built of stone,
Sticks and bones
And souls aren't built of stone
