
Sunlight fading fast, make it last
Like a flame flickers, then it's past
Moonlight fades to dark, carry on
You never know what's real until it's gone

But love deals the currency of loss
Don't ever forget what it cost

Hold on to me, carry me through
Our story needs the pain that we outgrew
Yeah, you can't call it love until you've lost
If you love someone this is what it cost

This city cries softly tonight
Like a million teardrops from a thousand eyes
I'm drenched beneath the rainy Melbourne skies
Wonder how it is I feel so dry inside

But love uses the pain to drill the holes
That irrigate our dry and thirsty souls

Hold on to me, carry me through
Our story needs the pain that we outgrew
Yeah, you can't call it love until you've lost
If you love someone this is what it cost

Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh

Sunlight fading fast, make it last
Sunlight fading fast, make it last
