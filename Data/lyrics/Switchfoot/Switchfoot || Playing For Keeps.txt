
Do me a favor
Would you sing this to me slow?
'Cause I'm thinking it's my song
Do me a favor
Would you tell me when to let go?
'Cause I think I'm holding on
Would you do it for me?
'Cause I'm playing for keeps

Tell me tomorrow has come
With open arms
If you say it's time to move on
Then I'll stop holding on
If you say that it's time for moving on
Time for moving on

Do me a favor
Would you tell me which way is up?
'Cause I don't know where I fit

Do me a favor
'Cause I'm playing for keeps
