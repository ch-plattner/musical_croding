
Head over here and take me
Head over heels and aching 
When I told you I was yours
I was yours

In this life, you're the one place I call home 
In this life, you're the feeling I belong 
In this life, you're the flower and the thorn 
You're everything that's fair in love and war

I'm coming down like a gunshot
In all these battles I've fought
You're the mark I'm aiming for
I was yours

Head over heels 

In this life I'm stubborn to the core
In this life I've been burning after more 
We both know what these open arms are for 
You're everything that's fair

In this life, you're my only one
