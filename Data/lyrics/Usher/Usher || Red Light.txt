[talking:]
It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here baby

[verse 1]
Girl you let me
Have my way and i was thinkin i could get it again
Baby we could be friends if you're lonely (ssh)
And you show me
Just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind
Tell me where did you go

[hook 1]
When you left (oh)
I'm thinkin which way did she go
I should have known that you would lead me on girl
Im in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreamin cuz i never felt like this before

[chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

[verse 2]
Now its rainin
And i'm lookin over at the passenger side
Thinkin back in my mind how you set me off
She was stoppin and droppin me
Switchin from fast to slow
But that aint have nothing on how you got
When i got you home

[hook 2]
When you left (oh)
I'm thinkin which way did she go
The way you touched yourself 
Had me up the wall
Im in the wind on cruise control
I'm searchin for you cuz i can't seem to let you go

[chorus]

[talking]
You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one night stand
What you doin to me
Come on
What you doin to me

[bridge]
Maybe (maybe)
She's runnin home to someone else (someone else)
Or maybe (or maybe)
She lost my number in her cell
(oooh babe)
(what you doin to me)
Or maybe (or maybe)
She's never done like this before
Cuz i cant see (can't see)
Her not comin back for more
More

[chorus 2X]
