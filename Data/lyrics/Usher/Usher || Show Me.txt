Great
Everybody's going through something
They gotta get over it
You can't go around
Let's just enjoy all the time

The night is young, you know
We've just begun
Let's have some fun until the moon turns to the sun
Look out the dj's got this party jumping
It's easy to let loose when you sipping something
Relax, it's what you deserve
There's no need to be reserved, no

Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?

Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for

Telling you can't control what you can't have
You're here, to enjoy yourself
But time, in the back of your mind
Spinning what left of it on the floor
Have another round and just enjoy this party
Put your favorite sign, go head and grab somebody
Ain't no limit, no such thing is too much
And if you cause a line in the V.I
I'm waiting on you to show me

Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?

Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for

If you find yourself not knowing what to do
Just lift you hands up high improvise
And don't you worry about what they think of you
All you can do is just live your life
Wo-ah, now it's the time
Now it's the time
So come on show me what you're all about
Right here, right now
There is the perfect time and place

Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night can you stay up?

Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
Show me, what you came here for
