[Lil Kim]
You got it going on (what, what)
you got it going on (what, what)
Come on, come on Strictly fuck we/those (6) digit niggas
If the first one is a (9) they a buck behind 
I live my rhyme 
At the same time can't find myself layin up 
If you payin up
Bullets start sprayin up
you know my niggas is sick 
the game ain't enough
for you to run up in this 
I needs stacks of chips
you know dream house money, 
Shit you just like me so don't start acting funny 

[Usher]
Your the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that your just so damn good (so damn good)
But your secrets I found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth, you know I do (I do)

[chorus:]

I know you get lonely
Just like me
And you want it
Just like me
But act like you don't
you know you're just like me 


[Usher]
Quiet is kept you cry  for help
When no one else is there I betcha you touch yourself
Does it feel good?
Late night calls, I betcha you do it all
Anything to get it off 
but you still persist to front on me
Baby tell me

[bridge]
Why (oh why) do we play this game of chase
When we know we both feel the same way
And why
do you put me through all these changes
When you know your just a freak like me 
your just like me

[Lil Kim]


If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice your opinion Queen Bee made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it
 When ya head be in between it, if I had a penis
 I'd be heartless for real though, niggas start shit,
I'd just flash out my dido, ya'll move to quick
Thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks
And ya smoke gray six, nigga thought you was a groupie
obsessed fan with my picture in your hooptie
You heard my record now ya know I'm freaky
So ya wanna wreck it and ya wanna see me
How your dreams be, you want me sexual
 In a gun fight, 2 on 3
I'm next to pull, and I love life
Something you never could imagine, then you woke the fuck up
It's just rappin' 

[Hook]

Don't front like you don't girl you're just like me 

Just like me 
Just like me
