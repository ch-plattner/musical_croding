Your body's like Hocus Pocus babe
It's magical to me (Whoa)
Do me a favor come here and pinch me baby
I wanna make sure this ain't a dream (Dream)
I said it's just like fire, shot up in my bones
Cause you take me higher, now baby 3, 2, 1, let's go

I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face up on a milk carton

Where you been all my life's without ya
Cause I been living beneath my means
Given my situation (Oh)
Yeah you're the last puzzle piece
You know what I'm talking about babe
I said it's just like fire shot up in my bones
Cause you take me higher, girl 3, 2, 1, let's go

I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true that people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face up on the milk carton

What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face up on the milk carton

I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true that people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face upon the milk carton
