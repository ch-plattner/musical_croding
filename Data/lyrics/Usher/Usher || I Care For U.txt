
I'm saying, I care but it's like, you don't hear me
What more could I do?

Girl you can keep that, trying to make me jealous
I admit that I been careless
But we can't take back what's done
I know why you did that
You're frustrated cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
Cause normally my feelings don't show

But baby I care for you
By now you should know that
I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get is what you see
The truth is girl underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you

Everyday I tryna prove myself to you
But what's the point
No such thing as satisfying you
Maybe you'll appreciate it later
By the time I'm gone
Better get your act together
Don't wait too long
Don't wanna change what we have
To what we had
Girl I need you to know

That I care for you
By now you should know that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get is what you see
The truth is girl underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you, I do

Gotta believe it
Gotta believe it
I care
Gotta believe it
Gotta believe it
I care, I care
You know I care

I care for you
By now you should know that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get is what you see
The truth is girl underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby I care for you

I care, I care, I care for you
