
I know I vowed to never do this again but I
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
You're the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it gotta let it go
Know, that I mean every note.
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), listen baby.

Let me start by saying that the way I
Feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem baby I can't lie
Coz lately I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said "I do"
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

And it's killing me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby said it's killin me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man (ooh ho)
Why would you love a fool
With all the things I do
I know it's hard for you
Hard for you to live with this

Trade memories from moments
Treat love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me
Blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And then spotlight feel like the bright light
But it's really just my fears
And it still don't dry your tears
When I, say she ain't you
When I, really love you more
When you, say if it's true
Why'd you do it for?
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break you heart, make you cry
I just wanna say goodbye

And it's killing me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is foolin around
Oh baby said it's killin me girl
Said I just dont understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man (ooh ho)
Why would you love a fool
With all the things I do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with this

What I feel I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's now way to deny that my heart
Is a time bomb
When seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossipy talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know
Before long you will see
That you deserve more, you derserve more
You derserve so much more
That what I'll ever be

And it's killing me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is foolin around
Oh baby said it's killin me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man (ooh ho)
Why would you love a fool
With all the things I do
I know it's hard for you
Hard for you to live with this (uh)
Live with this
Can you, live with this, girl (ohh)
I just want you know...

Got something that you need to know
You're the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it gotta let it go
Know, that I mean every note. (yeah)
Yeah [x5], hhmmm
