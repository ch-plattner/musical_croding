And I'm gonna...

Baby is the pressure of knowing that
I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone who knows exactly what you want

I know the fire's burnin', but baby there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's fallin, girl and I'll be the thunderstorm
Oh yeah

You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needin' my service
Baby your wish will be my command

Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here

When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby I'll go deep, open up if you're ready for me to feed cha
And let me tell you who you are? Let me taste it, you can take it
It's goin' down right here.

Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here

All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of lovin'
You goin' nowhere
(You ain't goin nowhere)

I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here
