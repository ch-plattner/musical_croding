
I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough
I asked her for her hand
Said would you like to dance
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam
Ohhh

[Hook]
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way too
I waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

[USHER]
I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good lovin' to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah

[MONICA]
Now I've been trying to find someone too
I prayed to God, and then I found you
I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart

[Hook]
Play another slow jam
This time make is sweet
On a slow jam
Can I get a slow jam
Do you want to slow jam, baby
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
Can I get a slow jam
Play another slow jam
Are you gonna slow jam
