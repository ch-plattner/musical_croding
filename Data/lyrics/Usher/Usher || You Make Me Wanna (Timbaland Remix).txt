Uh, uh-uh, can you feel me?
Uh, say what? Say what
Uh, uh-uh, can you feel me?
Usher

[1 - Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and all the things it come along with
You make me 

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and all the things it come along with 
You make me, you make me

[Usher] 
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how

[Repeat 1]

[Usher]
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
Cuz I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Repeat 1]

[Timbaland]
Baby it's kind of honey 
How you make me feel
I've been with your friend for about five years (five years)
I never thought that I would change my decision (uh-huh)
I wanna kiss you and hold your hand with your permission
(Uh-huh)
Honey got me twisted in the head like a cuckoo clock
Trying not to look
But I, but I, but I can't stop
What can I say? I wanna be with you
Usher bring in the hook, I'm out dude what?

[Repeat 1]

Ooh you're making me
You're making me, you're make me
Oh you make meÂ¡-

[Repeat 1]

Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and all the things it come along with 
You make me, you make me

[Repeat 1 till end]
