
What we gon' do now (oh lord, try some if u like it)
Is slow it down on tha flo (you know you like that)
(try some if you like that)
Uh oh
Uh oh, yeah

When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows (yeah)
But there's more to my life than people could ever know (uh huh)
Sometimes I gotta smile (smile)
When I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride (ride)
When I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you girl (fo sho)
I can always be myself with you girl
That's why I'm singing

[Chorus]
Ooooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Uh oh
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Thats why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (uh oh)
Thats why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now

Since you been in my life
When I'm away from you I hurry home, aww yeah (aww yeah, I hurry home)
You live in my mind so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah (alone)
Sometimes I gotta go (go)
Where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast (fast)
And I feel like slowing down (slowing down)
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

[Chorus x2]
Ooooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (come now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (girl come follow me now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now (oooh)
Right now (right now)

You've been there for me and i'll (so i'll)
I'll be there for you girl

[Chorus x 3]
Ooooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

[Fade]
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (what we gon' do now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (is slow it down on tha flo)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now
