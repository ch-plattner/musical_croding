
I can't let nothing come in between the two of us.
Cuz it's like your all i need since we've been together. And whenever I'm in need of a little
love, it's okay for me to open up.  But i just can't give my heart to anyone else.

Some only come in your life for a season, and stay a while,  giving you a reason to take
temporary and think that it's forever.  And you've given me someone that I can believe in. I
know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement.  But i know we'll figure out the
up's and down's.  Tell me are you willing to take a chance?  Baby if so...

[Hook:]
We go, We go
Let me put you in my hands
Come on, Come on
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right
So that's you'll be with me a lifetime
She'll know and I know
Don't think that I'm talkin crazy
Your mama and my mama want some grand babies tonight
Want you to be with me a lifetime

I used to think it was hopeless and I should just give it up.  But I couldn't stop until I
found myself a good girl to be in love.  I checked every state and city and looked all around
the world. And I'm proud to say that my search ends here. Cuz your one in a million to me and I
can't let you go.

Listen
Seasons are truly meant to chance
However love can be the reason you fall
And when you find that spacial someone
You will be willing to give them a lifetime
I love you and I choose you
Follow me
