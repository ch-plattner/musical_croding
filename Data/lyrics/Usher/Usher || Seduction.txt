[Women]
(sexy sexy sexy)
voluptuous
I love your confidence
When you got it
You got it
Seduce me baby
Seduce me

Just to get my attention
Send a note and a drink
When we made eye connection
She just knodded and winked
On this note it says:
"Bout' time we get together
Lets dance now
Hook up later
We can do whatever"
She had Confidence
But it's all part of the game
Cos' to her who im with 
Don't really mean a thing
She knew just what I like
And now I'm thirsty for more
Seduction

[Chorus]
Sensual, sexy, erotic
How you workin' your body
You gon' get me 
Do It
Do It 
to ya
Seduction
You thought out your best
To get me outa control, baby
The more I creep around with you
Make me wanna get
Down 
(down)
Down
(down)
Down with ya

You got my attention
What you gon' do with it?
Baby turn around
Stick it out
I wanna see it
She made the first move smooth
Intoxicatin'
She crazy
Im fightin' not to lose control

Now I'm feeling a little tension
Don't know whose watchin'
GETTIN' BIG
In too deep 
And I can't stop it
(Your making me)
Your making it
HARD for me to stay
HARD to walk away
HARD don't wanna play no more
HARD I can't take it baby

Seduction

[Chorus]

Baby whatever you want 
Girl you got it
Long as your satisfied
Cos' it's so hard to resist
Oh your body 
Got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
The positions that I'm gunna try
But is it worth all the hurt
Should I risk it?
Just for one night
Once I give it 
She's gunna win
Either way I lose
But I gotta have you

I'm tryin' to chill
But she's got me on the spot
She's so cocky
And the way she watchin' me
Got me feelin' hott, uh
Shorty know that I gotta girl
And I really can't break the rules
Plus poparatzi snappin shots
And it's hard for me to shake these fools
So do I 
One: put it on her 
Work my way to the front
Do I
Two: Do my part
And sure don't try to pull no stunts
Or maybe 
Three:  Chase the cat 
Cos' she's sending me on the hunt
Naw 
Bump that
I aint no punk
Im gunna give shorty what she want!
Seduction

[Chorus]
[Repeat 3x]
