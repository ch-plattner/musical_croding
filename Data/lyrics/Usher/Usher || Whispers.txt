
If I could I'd tell you (I would tell you how)
I feel girl, when I'm close to you
At times I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how)
Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers...

If my heart could speak you'd know
Girl if my heart could speak you'd know
That I love you so (and I'll never let you go
oh-no)

If you can feel what I felt (just now, kiss me)
To prove that your love for me is true
Two hearts that beat as one, send signals
To each other in whispers...

[Chorus]
I would tell you how I felt, if i could find the words
To describe (the way I feel when you are near)
Whenever you are by my side
What I feel inside is deep and I just don't know
What to say (because my words get in the way)
Everytime I try to say (I love you) what I feel
Deep inside

[Chorus]
