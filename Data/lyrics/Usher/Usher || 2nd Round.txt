Just touched down in town again
You think about me now and then
Been missing my lover friend
Let's say we have a 2nd round again

Girl, it's been a while
So I thought I'd hit you up
You never left my mind
Let's pick it up where we left off
The last time I left you thirsty baby
So let me feel you up
Yeah It's been a minute
I know you miss the way we touch
You can think about you don't want it
You don't wanna come across too anxious
Come see if you'd like for a second

[Chorus:]
Girl I'm in your town, come over
Girl don't let me down I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time
One that we'll both remember
Girl give me your best, expect none less girl

Said you wouldn't but you did it, oh girl
I can tell you don't regret it 'cause you ain't been touched like this
Since the last time

The feeling that I get
Everytime we can dance, oh lady
One more kiss, let em out, but I'll be back around
Baby you can hang around if you want to
But I gotta be out, Handle some B.I.
When I get back get ready for a second round

[Chorus:]
Girl I'm in your town, come over
Girl don't let me down I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time
One that we'll both remember
Girl give me your best, expect none less girl

Just touched down in town again
You think about me now and then
Been missing my lover friend
Let's say we have a 2nd round again

[Chorus:]
