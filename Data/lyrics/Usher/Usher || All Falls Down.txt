She built a bridge out of her own insecurities
No one was brave enough to cross except for me
Here I am
She built a castle from the pieces she took from me
I'm going crazy, I think she brought all the worst in me
Here I am (Yeah)

Guess the price was the fall if I get up
Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting down
Six feet underground

Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me (Yeah)
And I'm the fool who falls to easily
We all fall down sometimes
We all fall down sometimes
So why can't I (hey..)
So why can't I (hey..)

You gotta go I know the time waits for no man
Don't say your words unspoken girl I overstand
Here I am
Why do we meet? Some questions don't have an answer
Two out of three made me a believer
Here I am

Guess the price was the fall if I get up
Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love her heart is resting down
Six feet underground

Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me (Yeah)
And I'm the fool who falls to easily
We all fall down sometimes
Girl we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I (hey..)
So why can't I (hey..)

Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me (Oh yeah)
And I'm the fool who falls to easily
We all fall down sometimes
Girl we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I (hey..)
So why can't I (hey..)
