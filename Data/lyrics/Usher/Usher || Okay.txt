I can't believe my eyes,
Looking at your sexy, yes, body
The way you do it with your hands up
I just wanna be all over
Let me rock, with you
Don't let nothing interrupt this groove
Going at it like we bout to
Touchin all on you like youâ€™re my girl

[Chorus:]
You probably say that's a damn shame (that's a shame)
I don't even know your name (no)
I know it probably won't matter tonight
Cause you been all on me I'm like
OKAY!!
okay
I suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shawdy holla at me if that sound
OKAY!!

[Verse:]
Ah ahh yea
I see you wanna take it slow
Go in drop it to the floor real low
ooh You know I want you back cause I been all on that ass
And you ain't looking at me sideways
The DJ is playing the last song
And its coming down to our last call
This slow jam is specially dedicated, what better way for this night to end?
Come on

[Chorus]

Cause I'm signed with maybe if you ready to run
Love that I got you opened up
Curious of mine, to no whats on your mind girl
Girl we been at it so long I can't wait just want to make sure
we're on the same page
Come On [x3]
I be on some other shit when I look at talk
And I know you...

[Chorus]
