
This goes out to you, you, my number one (number one, number one)
I won't stop until I see you, suga
You know who you are
This is for my number one, number one (I see you)
So many shows, swear wherever I go I'm gonna keep on lookin'
Lookin' for my number one, number one (Oh)
This goes out to you baby
Wherever you are (my only one)
Just know that you're mine (number one, number one)
Are you there?
I can't hear you
On the road doin' shows
Girl I can't get you off my mind
All around the world
So many faces
All these places
Girl I just need one
My number one
This is for you, you, my number one

[Crowd chanting]
Usher! Usher! Usher!
