[Rico Love:]
Turn the lights on

[Usher:]
How could someone hurt you but still make you feel so good?
Holler, scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it
Just cause he gives you pain, that don't mean he ain't the one
Fuck you out your brain you'll be smiling when he's done

[Hook:]
So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no
Let that argument turn you on
It's worth it

[Chorus:]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover, for the lover [2x]

[Usher:]
So hard to imagine living life without them there
'Cause now you're so caught up in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare, yeah
Cause don't he make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum
You fought hard but think about how hard you come

[Hook:]
So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no
Just let that argument turn you on
It's worth it!

[Chorus:]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover, for the lover
A lesson for, a lesson for the lover, for the lover

C'mon here

[Bridge:]
No one wants to be fighting
All day long, all night long
So we'll just scream 'til we start making love (do you)
And as time goes on we're feeling
OK, babe, alright, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning

[Chorus:]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover, for the lover [2x]
