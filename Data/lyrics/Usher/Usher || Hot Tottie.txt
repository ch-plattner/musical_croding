Big ballin’ is my hobby
So much so they think I’m down with the illuminati
My watch do illuminate
My pockets are tottie
But I’m God body, ya’ll better ask somebody
I was born a God
I made myself a king
Which means I down graded to a human being
You was born a Goddess
I made you my queen
Which means we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her body like cognac
Her momma likes herb tea
We birthed a couple of sacks
And after she sleeped, I creeped in to her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking
In tongue she like young, you hung, what you done, done
Stop it fore you wake up my momma might (ahhhh)
Now that I’ve arrived it’s time that I go...
I’m so cold, I’m so cold...
