[Intro: Usher]
Yeah! What you say? Let me see it!
Make every minute worth it baby
This for Usher baby watch this

[Verse 1: Usher]
I done been around the world I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you bang bang bang!
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Uh! Rebel without a cause
No umbrella with money stuffed under doors
Rodeo drive money old as Clive Davis
Blue papers still chasin dead faces
Dark tints rims chalk like razors
Two mill to the side for the cases
Boss! Pinky ring both hands
Moskowitz wanna lean on a man
Peter Pan got exed out the plans
Lil’ homie still be movin like the feds
My Spanish chick be on that Telemundo
Pretty face and she got the fattest culo
Kissin all on me, pinchin all on me
Touch a lil’ paper start switchin all on me
I'm looking for the best kisser
With a passport time to get missing
Boss!

[Chorus: Usher]
Kisser! {Maybach Music} Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!! (Listen let me tell you something, uh!)

[Verse 3: Usher]
I done been around the world I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you bang bang bang!
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you
This girl she's my hero get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen
Da da da doe doe! (I ain't want to check off either)
I'm starin at your barrel pull the trigger chitty chitty bang bang
Da da da doe doe! Oooh! (I told her)
The devil is a lie, them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good you fuck my mind
You pull it out then you open fire
You make me want to tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired
I think I got a winner, could be a keeper

[Chorus: Usher]
‘Cause she’s such a good kisser! Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Bridge: Usher]
Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me baby with good flow
Don't hold it back come on give me more 
Come give it to me, give it all to me, give it up to me
I can't keep my control, every time that I see you hit that floor
Just keep on giving it to me I want mine
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it all to me
Heyyyyyyyyyyy!!!! Yeah!!!

[Interlude: Usher]
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up we be kissin all night (We be kissin all night!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up we be kissin all night (Oooh!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up we be kissin all night (All night!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up we be kissin all night (Ohhhhh! She’s a good)

[Chorus: Usher]
Kisser! Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Outro: Usher]
I done been around the world I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you bang bang bang!
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you
