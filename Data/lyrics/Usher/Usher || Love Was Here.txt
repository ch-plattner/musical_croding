
Baby tonight
If you come home
I'll make it right oh no
Love was here and gone

I ask myself
Now why have I been dreaming
2 bring imaginary
Real 2 life
I've done some searchin'
And prayin'
That you would always be stayin' (oh)
And I would learn
Learn 2 treat you right yeah

(So if)
So if you ask yourself
Does he reall love me
(Yes I do)
Will I be true
Throughout the time
(Ask yourself)
Do I know how 2 take good care of you
The answer that I truly love you
(And I really need you)
Will pop right in your mind

Love was here Baby
But now you're gone So far gone
Baby please Baby please
Please come home

Love was here Love was here
But you're gone
Baby please Baby
Just come back home Come home, come
home, come home
Come on home
Come on home Um.... 

I've given you a reason 
Let me know (um yeah)
2 make your leave, it must have been
That I don't show
(You love)
You love the way you need
So girl I can't complain
(No)
Let's try to work it out
My heart's truly ashamed
(So if)
So if you ask yourself
Does he really love me
(Yes I do)
Will I be true
Throughout the time
(Ask yourself)
And do I know how 2 take good care of you
(Well, well)
The answer that I truly love you
(And I really need you)
Would pop right in your mind

[chorus]
Come home Come home come home
(Come on home Girl just come on home

Let's ignore the 
fuss and fight
Just come back home 

Try to bring us back girl
So don't you ever leave

So baby please Baby come back come
