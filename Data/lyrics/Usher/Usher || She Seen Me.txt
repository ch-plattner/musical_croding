See I got a girl, that I love (Hey)
She's the only one I'm thinking of
And I wish she understood the way that I feel about her (She's mad)
She said she's had enough (Oh)
Now I'm up in the club like
Ooh, up in the V-I, sitting on a chair
Ooh, that's when I saw her sitting over there
She was chilling with her girlfriends (Yeah)
I was chilling with my homies (Yeah)
Then she made her over to my table (Whoa)
And she started dancing all on me
I should've said, "Hold up," (Hold up)
"Don't you know my girl?"
But the alcohol in me, make me wanna cut up
Damn, I'm out on the floor with her
Out the corner of my eyes 
See my girl best friend I'm like,
Damn, I know

[Chorus]
She seen me [x3]
Ohh, she seen me out with another girl (Girl [x3])
Ohh, heard I was out with another girl (Girl [x3])
Whoa, now, I'm caught up with another girl
(She seen me) I know it look bad, but it ain't
(She seen me) And I wanna take it back but I can't
(She seen me) And now the only thing going through my brain
She saw me out with an other girl

Now I'm thinking, ohhhh, what I'm gonna say to her when I get home (And I've been drinking)
Man, the way that her girlfriend was staring at me, I know she got it wrong
And I know she see me out on the floor (Yeah) 
And it was only a dance nothing more (Yeah)
I'm thinking, maybe, I could be wrong
Wondering why she calling me on my phone
I should've said, "Hold up, I got a girl"
But I didn't care
I was just getting some air
Didn't know she would be up in the club, noooo 
(I got caught up in this bullshit)

[Chorus]

Now that the club is over, I know I should go home
She keep calling me, but I know I don't wanna do wrong
If I go, we gonna be up all night
I rather that, than fuss and fight
We should make it worth the while
Cause I'm in trouble now
So, I might as well stay out with this other girl

[Chorus]
