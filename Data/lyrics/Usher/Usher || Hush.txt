Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows .. huh
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard

Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6 figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn’t understand the homeless, doesn’t think its genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
He does shit to make it better and I’m thinking huuu..

Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don’t want to sacrifice
Don’t say nothing, don’t say nothing
Oooooo .. Hush
Don’t say nothing
Oooooo .. Hush
Don’t say nothing

She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke
But oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
‘Coz she continues to ignore
But she’s like the TV – the story repeats
She’s searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news
She’s more entertained by lies and gossip
‘Coz it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it’s a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I’m thinking uhh huhuu

Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho)
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (scared to fly)
Everybody wants heaven (heaven)
If you don’t want to sacrifice (oh)
Don’t say nothing
Don’t say nothing
Oooooo .. hush
Don’t say nothing (My hand to my brother)
Oooooo .. hush (Hand to my sister)
Don’t say nothing
Oooooo .. Hush
Don’t say nothing
Oooooo .. Hush
Don’t say nothing
