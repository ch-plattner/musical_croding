Ah what cha doing
Really
You know I'm coming over right
(now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
Now you got it hot for me already baby
Okay
I'll be there in about uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready

(now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
It's seven o' clock
On the dot
I'm in my drop top
Cruisin the streets - oh yeah
I gotta real pretty - pretty little thang that's waiting for me
I pull up
Anticipating good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen girl you know what I mean

[Hook:]
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just want to take it nice and slow
(now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
See I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be makin' love until the sun comes up
Baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
now here we are
Drivin' round town
Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down
Girl you got me sayin'
My, my, my, - My
I wish that I - I
Could pull over
And get this thing started right now
I wanna do something freaky to you baby
I don't think they heard me
I-I wanna do something freaky to you baby
So call out my name

[Rap]

They call me US-HER-RA-YM-OND
Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me
Gotta nigga from feelin' like Jodeci
Every time that you roll with me,holdin' me
Tryin to get control of me
Nice and Slow
You know
Never lettin' go
Never messin' up the flow
This is how the hook go

[Hook]

Now tell me
Do you wanna get freaky
Cause I'll freak you right I will
I'll freak you like one has ever made you feel
I'll freak you right I will
