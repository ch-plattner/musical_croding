
Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
Cause I was way better
Maybe its because
We were together

[Refrain]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

Youuuu
(looking for myself)
Youuuu
(I, I I, I I I)
Youuuu
(looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you

Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know, I will lose it all
I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together

[Refrain]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

Youuuu
(looking for myself)
Youuuu
(I, I I, I I I)
Youuuu
(looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you, girl

I was on a journey,
Tryin to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that,
When you're not here,
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me,
I had to find you
You know?
(youuuu)
And I got a funny feeling that
You won't know who you are
And unless you find me
It's like... You look in the mirror
And you see the person that you truely love

[Refrain]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

Youuuu
(looking for myself)
Youuuu
(I, I I, I I I)
Youuuu
(looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you
Heey, looking for myself
(I I, I I, I I I)
And somehow I ran right into youu
