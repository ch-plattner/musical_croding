Yo, shit
I'm sick of this man
I can't even take no more
Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you don't even understand
What this is doin' to me
Everytime I try to get away
I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin?
I just can't let you go

[Usher]
I never ever wanna hurt you
I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex ya
I wanna give you everything you need
That you want, just lay down
Let me love ya all night long
I wanna live, I just wanna keep ya
When they saw me, they saw you
In the world is just me and my girl
Is how feel ya, and the time party was right
DJ can play

We use to love and
Party now all we do is argue
I tell myself
I don't want you no more but
I can't let you go

So much love and hurt
And hate, people screamin
It won't work, time and time I say
I'm gonna leave but
I can't let you go

[JD]
This ain't funny man, you know what man
You ain't even got to wait in the mornin' man
You can get ahead in the night man
Ayyo clear, go rap, go shit, get out of here

[Usher]
Better day you gotta like me
But took now gonna fight me
You can walk away and say
I never gave everything you want, that you need
Now we have do is all you all night long
I don't wanna lay you, see you
With another brother lovin you sayin
Down the world it's me and my girl
That's how we feel, we you think everything, it's real
But it really...

We use to love and
Party now all we do is argue
I tell myself
I don't want you no more but
I can't let you go

So much love and hurt
And hate, people screamin
It won't work, time and time I say
I'm gonna leave but
I can't let you go
