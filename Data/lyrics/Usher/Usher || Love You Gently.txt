[Verse 1]
First see the city skylights shining from my room
You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say
It's been a long time
I say OK K K don't worry I got you
Do ya say
How bout some foreplay
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do ya say
Play some slow ones
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye too
To love you gently

[Chorus]
Let me love you gently
Lay back relax, Girl I'm gonna be
Light as a feather but hard as a rock
Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock

[Verse 2]
See I know just when to finish
And I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction
Every time I hit that spot
Gently
Bottom soft like leather
Gently
But the top is hard
Gently
Whisper your pleasures
Gently
Then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense
Girl let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder
The music or you
Gently
I ain't close to be done yet
Gently
But your getting real warm
Gently
Like the calm of the thunder
Gently
Right after the storm

You say, you say, do you say it girl
Make it
Gonna push it to the limit
It's yours, It's yours
See second place or win the race
I'm gonna be your number one
Til the sun shines
Here comes the sun
Forever more
Let's try and taste the moon again forever more

[Chorus]
Let me touch you gently
That's the sound of love
Ripping shades off the wall
Light as feather but hard as a rock
This might not be in the bedroom but I'm gonna love you girl gently
Light as a feather but hard as a rock

Let me touch you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather but hard as a rock

[Outro]
Can you feel me girl
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you
Wanna love you
