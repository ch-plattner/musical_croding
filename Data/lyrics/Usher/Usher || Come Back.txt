
Ooh, Ohh, hey...
Na,Na,Na,Na,Na
What Ya'll wanna do
What all wanna do (tell me)

[JD's RAP]

See around here
We're just too much
We could slow it down and ya still couldn't
Catch us
My town
Full of heavy hitters,
Bread getter
Real fly unforgettable type niggas
See all I do is keep hittin' em  up
Getting' em up
Shakin' ya but
Nigga, what
Lil Liberaci
Can't nobody stop me
Always's makin' moves
So you better watch me
Slide
To the southside in my blue drop top
355 keep' it live
When ya wanna make em jump (jump)
You know what to do
Call me and my crew
To the rescue
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party til there's no one
Left , (4, show)
Trun ya volume up a notch
And watch the ba bomb, bump, bump, bump
Make yo' speakers pop
You never missed your water til your well runs
Dry
I never missed my woman til she said good - bye
Now my heart made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready
To give you what you deserved
Baby, baby, baby please


[Hook]

Come back, Come back
Lover this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, Come back
Lover this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl
The grass is greener
On the other side
We take people for granted til they're
Out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you

All I do
Is think of you
I can't eat
Can't sleep
Baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)
All I do
Is think of you
And ya bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby

[Hook]

It's not what you want baby
But what you need surger
Come back with me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
