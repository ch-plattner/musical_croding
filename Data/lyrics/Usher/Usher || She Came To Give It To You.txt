Say it ain't what you do cause...

So if you knew what I knew
She'd be yours tonight
Yeah, baby
Imagine she came here to getaway
Well she don't want nobody crowding the space
Huh, wouldn't that be weird? oh yeah
She was up tonight to get down
But she don't wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn't that be weird? oh yeah

I'm so confused
If you only knew
She came to give it to you

Girl it ain't what you do
It's what you do tonight
And there ain't no shortcuts
In doing something right
If you knew what I knew
She'd be yours tonight
Just look around the club
Cause you're here to have a good time

So many benefits to being quiet
Just be cool, enjoy the ride
'Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah
Don't be stingy when it comes to J, Let her hit it if it's headed her way
My nigga that's weird

I'm so confused
If you only knew
She came to give it to you

Girl it ain't what you do
It's what you do tonight
And there ain't no shortcuts
In doing something right
If you knew what I knew
She'd be yours tonight
Just look around the club
Cause you're here to have a good time

I'm so confused
If you only knew
She came to to give it to you

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo
He want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who get the worm it's the early bird flow
Slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these bitches like sterly sturl
I seen him in the club he could get the cub
I ain't talking about baseball but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ and forget your glove
Tryna get faded, go and get the drug
Five plus five what they call that? Ten
Out in japan we be counting that, Yen
Ladies who you trying get it popping with? Men
No little boys in the circle of Usher
Got em under pressure
When your girl come through Nicki gon' crush her
And tell your man play the back like a spine
You only last 6 seconds like a vine

I'm so confused
If you only knew
She came to give it to you

Girl it ain't what you do
It's what you do tonight
And there ain't no shortcuts
In doing something right
If you knew what I knew
She'd be yours tonight
Just look around the club
Cause you're here to have a good time

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yeah, c'mon
C'mon, uh-huh, yo yo
I'm Nicki M and he is Usher
All these niggas be tryna cuff her
What you know about that Swiffer duster
Until next time you motherfucker
