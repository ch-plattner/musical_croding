Raymond vs Raymond 
There's three sides to every story, 
There's one side, there's the other 
And then there's the truth. 

Usher... [echo]
[French lady & Robot:]
Captivating, perfection, innovator, seductive, superstar, music, unparalleled, sex, world renown, dance, tempo, spotlight, passionate, terrible. 
You... are.... what.... we... say.... you... are 

Mon star

[Usher:] Black heart
Sound, sound, sound... 
[Usher:] Everything that's on my mind I just.. I gotta let go
[French lady:] Allez vient on y vas
[Usher:] I hope you can handle it
[French lady:] Vient on y vas

[Usher:] Feel my heartbeat... Ah..
[French lady:] Mon-star
[Usher:] Yeah, close your eyes...
[Usher:] Hey, look what you made me do babe, say you know me, tell you want all of me, and then you got the other side.
You got some nerve baby 
Make it so bad 
You so serious, wouldn't just have to fall 
Don't you.. don't you tell me... tell me that things get to you without all of that attitude 
I feel like you might be the one... aight babe 
You got me so excited baby 

[Pre-chorus:]
Girl if you lonely and you're longing for a lover you know I'll be, I'll be here all night.
I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further you know I'll be, I'll be here all night

[Chorus:]
[French lady:] Mon star.
(Celebrating time) 
[Usher:] Tell me how deep you want me to go. 
(I'm back celebrating tonight) 
[Usher:] I'm gonna be your baby yeah..
I wanna be up in your bedroom, just all for one night 
I'll be the magic player lover you like

[Usher:]
Redefining roundly every time we lay, every time we go.
She said she wanna bring out the beast, but she can't tame it, tame it. (Haha).
Won't let you pull something off. B-b-bang I'mma shoot it like a convict. 

[Pre-chorus:]
Girl if you lonely and you're longing for a lover you know I'll be, I'll be here all night.
I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further you know I'll be, I'll be here all night

[Chorus:]
[French lady:] Mon star.
(Celebrating time) 
[Usher:] Tell me how deep you want me to go. 
(I'm back celebrating tonight) 
[Usher:] I'm gonna be your baby yeah.. 
I wanna be up in your bedroom, just all for one night. 
I'll be the magic player lover you like

[French lady:] Mon star.... 
Je t' aime 
Tu es mon star

[Usher:] Ca te plait?
[French lady:] Oui, vient avec moi, tu es mon star

[Chorus:]
[French lady:] Mon star.
(Celebrating life) 
[Usher:] Tell me how deep you want me to go. 
(I'm back celebrating tonight) 
[Usher:] I'm gonna be your baby yeah.. 
I wanna be up in your bedroom, just all for one night. 
I'll be the magic player lover you like
