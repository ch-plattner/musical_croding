
Ooh no no, no no no no….

[Verse 1:]
I got two-dozen roses, and a card that says baby I can’t wait to see you later
We made dinner reservations at Nobu or Mr. Chow you just pick the location
Now we’re sitting at the table sippin’ the finest wine having a damn good time
I know what’s on your mind… I want you, you want me too stop frontin’ I know exactly what you wanna do

[Chorus:]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you won’t regret it let me set it out like you ain’t never had it 
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh 
Do it to me I’m gonna give it to you, I’m gonna make this a night to remember

[Verse 2:]
Watchin’ you work the stick in the ride , the motion how you move from 3rd to 5
Can't imagine what it’s gon’ be once we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you want me the same way, ooh I can’t wait
I’m tired of thinkin’ about it, speakin’ about it, baby it’s time to be about it, turn off the lights, take off your
clothes, jump in the bed, and let it flow
Squeeze and holdin’ bitin’ scratchin’ spankin’ screamin’ pullin’ my hair when you need me everything goes…baby when you….

[Chorus:]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you won’t regret it let me set it out like you ain’t never had it 
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh 
Do it to me I’m gonna give it to you, I’m gonna make this a night to remember

[Bridge:]
So long I waited for this night to get inside you look in your eyes and tell you baby take me I’m yours
And if you feel anything like I feel, by the end of the night I’m certain you’ll be screamin’ for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body till you break down can’t take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs you gon’ get it baby  please please…ooh DO IT TO ME….

[Chorus:]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you won’t regret it let me set it out like you ain’t never had it 
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh 
Do it to me I’m gonna give it to you, I’m gonna make this a night to remember
