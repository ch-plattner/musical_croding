
It's like whatever I do,
Ooh
Just can't get through to you
Ooh, ooh
I'm never gonna tell anything wrong
Ooh, ooh,
Listen
Oh

Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me
When you said that, baby no worries I promise to get us back

[Chorus:]
I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains...
It's like moving mountains... hey.
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away.
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)

[Hook:]
Why just leave me?
Just leave me be
Just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be, ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaaa, whoa

She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Well baby why you just leave me?
Just leave me be
Just leave me
Just leave me be.
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be, ooh

This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on...
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together, baby yeah
And these hills that I'm travelin' up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down
Whoa

[Chorus]

Well baby why you just leave me?
Just leave me be
Just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be, ooh

Baby, baby
Whoa, yeah
