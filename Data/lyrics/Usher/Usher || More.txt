Watch me as I dance under the spotlight- 
listen to the people screaming out more, and more
Cos I create the feeling that keep em coming back, 
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep em coming back, 
So captivating when I get it on the floor. 

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it, 
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that Monster in the mirror, 
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner. 
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up. 

[CHORUS x2] 
If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
if you on the floor, bring out the fire, 
And light it up, take it up higher, 
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more. 

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite 
put em in the air, if you more (and) more, 
Cos I can't wait to feel it. 
I go hard, can't stop, 
But if I stop just know that Imma bring it back, 
Never quittin' don't believe in that. 

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it, 
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror, 
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner. 
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up. 

[CHORUS x2] 
If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
if you on the floor, bring out the fire, 
And light it up, take it up higher, 
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more. 

Ooooooooo....
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more..
Ooooooooo....

[CHORUS x2] 
If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
if you on the floor, bring out the fire, 
And light it up, take it up higher, 
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more. 

Ooooooooo....
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more..
Ooooooooo....

Gotta push it to the limit, give it more.
