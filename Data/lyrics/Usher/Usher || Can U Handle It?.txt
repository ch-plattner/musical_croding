[Usher speaking]
What's up baby
I'm so glad I got you here
I'm so in love with you
And I don't ever wanna lose you
I wanna take this to the next level
I hope you ready

Now that you're here
I got somethin' to say baby
I think that you should know
You're doin' the most, suga
So don't worry 'bout the situation
I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
Can you handle it
If I go there baby with you
I can handle it
I can go there baby with you
Oh I hear you talkin' babe
Can you handle it
Can I go there baby with you
We gon' set it off
We gon' tear it up
Baby can you handle

Wooooo baby
You say all the time
You only want the best of my love
Now I can see that 
There's only one way to tear it up
Yeah
I'm willing to tell you
Everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much

What about you babe
Will you tell me
All the freaky things you are
Before I do
Need you to know
If we make it through
Our love will grow
Oooh ho ho
Imagine how amazing things would be

[Chorus]
Can you handle it
Can I go there baby with you
We gon' set it of
We gon' tear it up
Baby can u handle
I can handle it
I can go there baby with you
Oh I hear you talkin' babe
We gon' set it out
We gon' work it out
Baby can you handle

Oooh hey yeah baby
I fear sometimes in my mind
That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby
If I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly
The man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much

Uhhhhh
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself
Should I go there
Should I do it
Yeeeaaahhh oooooh
Can I give it to you fully
Can you handle it

[Chorus]
Can you handle it
If I go there baby with you
We gon' lay it out
We gon' tear it up
Baby can u handle
I can handle it
I can go there baby with you
We gon' set it out
We gon' make it out
Baby can you handle

Can you handle it
Can I go there baby with you
We gon' set it off
We gon' tear it up
Baby can you handle

We gon' set it out
We gon' work it out
Baby can you handle

Can you handle it
Can I go there baby with you
We gon' set it off
We gon' tear it up
Baby can you handle
