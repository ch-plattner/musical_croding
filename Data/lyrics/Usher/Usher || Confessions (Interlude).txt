[Usher talking on phone]
Hello?
Yo I'm in the booth I'mma call you right back
Nah I just gotta put this one part down I'mma call you back
I'm at the studio man what--
Man quit playin' with me man
No for real don't play like that
Are you--are you serious?
How you know?
Put that on everything.
Damn
I'mma call u back
I'mma call u back...

[Intro]
Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Everytime you called I told you,
"Baby I'm workin." (No!)
I was out doin my dirt (Oh!)
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (Just listen)
Thinkin' I got it and left you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
But you prolly believe you got a good man
I man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself
It ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else (oh no)

[Usher speaking]
I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more
listen...
