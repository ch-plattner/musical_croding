With this lady and some freaks at the bar

You go get some girls and
Bring em to me

And you rockin' like a pro wit it girl
By the way, you got right on it
With the chick you wanted
And now you in the corner kissin' on a girl

Lookin' little freaks at the bar
Lookin for a star

Let her put her hands in your pants
Be my little freak
If you fuckin' with me
Really fuckin' with me
Let her put her hands in your pants
Be my little freak

[Nicki Minaj:]
Excuse me little mama
But you could say I'm on duty
I'm lookin' for a cutie
A real big o' ghetto booty
I really like your kitty kat
And if you let me touch her
I know you're not a bluffer
I'll take you to go see Usher
I keep a couple hoes
Like Santa I keep a vixen
Got that dasher, dancer, prancer
Dixen, comet, cupid, Donner, BLITZEN!
I'm hotter than 100 degrees
A lotta bread, no sesame seeds
If I'm in yo city
I'm signin them tig ol bitties
I'm plottin on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy
The girls want a Minaj
Yeah they wetta than a Rainmen
Usher buzz me in,
EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND!

If you fuckin' with me
Really fuckin' with me
You go get some girls and
Bring em to me
If you fuckin' with me
Really fuckin' with me
You'll let her put her hands in your pants
Be my little freak
Be my little freak
Be my little freak
Let her put her hands in your pants
Be my little freak
If you fuckin' with me
Really fuckin' with me
Let her put her hands in your pants
Be my little freak
