
Famous name, famous life, famous nights, oh yeah
Really don't regret I made it
But unless she was here to be famous with me
Even though it's been war and corner eyes, between us for years
I swear if I could change it, I wouldn't change everything
Just all the moments I've hurt you 
I'd reverse I'd reverse and make some better decisions

Please, I'm missing a woman that I gotta find
I miss her, touch, I miss her, smile
If you've seen her tell her that I miss her, please
I'm missing my woman I won't stop until she's back in my life

Calling up car, where is she?
family and friends, won't give me any info
They don't know where she goes 
But I still believe we're unbreakable I'm needing her no more than before, oh yeah, I swear that I wanna change it
Though I ain't perfect girl, I won't purposely hurt you

I'd reverse and make some better decisions
If anybody is listening please, I'm missing a woman that I gotta find
I miss her, touch, I miss her, smile, if you see her tell her that I miss her 
Please, I'm missing my woman, I won't stop until she's back in my life

I'm missing you like no strings on a violin
A sailboat in the water but without the wind, I can't move, no I can't move
If it would bring me [?] will
Got the key to my car but without the gas I can't move
And I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I'm missing my woman
I miss her, touch, I miss her, smile,
If you've seen her tell her that I need her
Please, I'm missing my woman, she's back in my life
