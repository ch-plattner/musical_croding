[Talking:]
It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here baby

[verse 1]
Girl you let me
Have my way and i was thinkin i could get it again
Baby we could be friends if you only (ssh)
And you show me
Just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind
Tell me were did you go

[hook 1]
When you left (oh)
I'm thinkin which way did she go
I should have known that you would lead me on girl
Im in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreamin cuz i never felt like this before

[chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

[verse 2]
Now its rainin
And i'm lookin over at the passenger side
Thinkin back in my mind how you set me off
She was stoppin and droppin me
Switchin from fast to slow
But that aint have nothing on how you got
When i got you home

[hook 2]
When you left (oh)
I'm thinkin which way did she go
The way you touched yourself
Had me up the wall
Im in the wind on cruise control
I'm searchin for you cuz i can't seem to let you go

[chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

[Ludacris]
Uh yea uh
She had a coke bottle shape
Pretty big booty, small waist
Now I feel a little woozy
Cuz I really want to see her face once more
Now this woman got me messed up in my head
I forgot about my thoughts and what I said
All I can remember is one night more than one hour on one floor
Oh there was one red light by the bed 
That was glowing off her skin when I did my thing
We was drippin with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lust 
Cuz I must of really digged her frame
And all I wanna say is that we handle ours
There aint to many women that can handle stars
And what I wouldn't give just one more time
For the chance to grip them handle bars

[chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
