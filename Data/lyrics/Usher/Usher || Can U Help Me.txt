Living on the edge out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried, I work hard to provide
all the material things that I thought would make you happy
I'm confused can you make me understand
'Cause I tried to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
Without you my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Oh, girl) I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't want to be alone

Girl, I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
And now we're not together 'cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time
That I wasted we used it to make sweet love.
Baby, be my guide please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you.
If you need it. I don't want to be on the outside looking in
I got to have you, girl, can't you see?

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you my whole world is falling apart
And without you I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Oh, girl) I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't want to be alone

(Please stay don't go)
Give me another chance I want to be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging pleading
I'll do anything for your love

Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
I don't understand
Girl, I'm just a man
Help me
Can help me?
Without you my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love

Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl I'll never stop, 'cause you're all I got
Can you help me?
Help me understand why I can't be your man
It's driving me crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
