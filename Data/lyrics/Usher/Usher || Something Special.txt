
This ones for the lovers
Follow me

[Verse 1]
Clearly this is new for me
I get excited when you're here my dear
Make no mistake your all I seeeee (suga)
My visions never been so clear (ha)
We both know I've been running so long
This time love won't let me leave
Please be patient set hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the mean time
Let me say what's on my mind (baby I)

[Chorus]
I think we've got something special
Girl you and me, Together we'll take over the world
You know I love ya, I need ya so
So happy I just wanna let everybody know (Think back to the time)
When I was scared, to let it show, having too much fun, this and that one (now that your mine)

[Verse 2]
Some where along the way everything fell in place (oooh)
I'm so proud in how you represent me baby
Whether rockin' Armani, Dolce Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Louis, or Gucci, girl
No matter what you wear, you do your own wit it
I'll feel the same years from here
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind (oooh, listen)

[Chorus]
I think we've got something special
Girl you and me, Together we'll take over the world
You know I love ya, I need ya so
So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
That I think we've got something special
Girl you and me, Together we'll take over the world
You know I love ya, I need ya so
So happy I just wanna let everybody know

[Bridge]
Now that your mind
Somewhere along the way
Everything fell in place
I think we've got something special
Girl you and me, Together we'll take over the world
You know I love ya, I need ya so
So happy I just wanna let everybody know
I think we've got something special
Girl you and me, Together we'll take over the world
You know I love ya, girl I need ya so
I'll never let you goooooo

Your So Special!
