[Phone ringing]
[Girl] Hey
[Usher] Hey, what's up?
[Girl] That's you
[Usher] Yeah listen

[Intro - Usher]
Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the sh*t I've been hearing babe I,
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in
Your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
If you were gonna tell it then you told instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone
Move on.

[Call waiting beeping]
[Usher] Hold up
[Operator] Hello, you got a collect call from Franklin correction facility will you accept the charges?
[Usher] Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

[Shyne]
Sittin' in my cell, heard about the burst,
Wouldn't be alive, if I didn't bust first,
I never said I was perfect,
Nobody walking n this earth is,
That night, I would have got murdered,
If I didn't grab the ratchet and lit them cowards up,

[Chorus (Usher):]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Kanye West]
Yeah Kanye To the College Dropout
Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she's gonna tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there
There's hoes there so basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back I confess

[J.D.]
If you got something to confess too right now, step to the mic... Twista!

[Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While having other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

[Chorus - Usher (J.D.)]
