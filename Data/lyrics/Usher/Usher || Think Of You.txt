
Oh yeah
Sh de da de dup dem de doo

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I been here before
Baby I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out baby

I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
Cause my heart loves you
I'm so confused

[Chorus]
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

To another love one that I can trust
With my heart I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more
So I'm out the door
Talk to me
Why you wanna play love games

[Chorus]
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on
