It's time to say goodbye
It's over now
It's time to say goodbye

Is there a reason why our love could not last
I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty
Lady
I thought we had a master plan
But it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away

I often wonder how and why
I did not cheat I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried
But it's over for now
It's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]

I can't believe how suddenly things change
Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were
Heartaches
And pain
Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out
But in my heart I knew
I still had my doubts

I thought we made a symphony
It's over now no more harmony
I prayed so hard for love to fly (oh yeah)
It's time to say goodbye
Ooh bye bye bye bye bye

[Chorus]

Sorry I gotta leave
Baby I'm beggin' please 
Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Bye bye bye bye

[Chorus]
