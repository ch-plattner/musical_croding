
Running away with my heart on my sleeve
A lotta late nights, always thirty one degrees
Your never...blazing compared to her heart
That's all I ever had, that's what she never got
And what I never got was her, yeah
And what I never got was her

My emotions are just running away with me
Pulling me to my toe
Taking me off my feet
Running, yeah I'm running if I know I'll get to where you are
I should think about it
But this happens with my heart

And I don't care, baby I'm all in there
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
Cause the one thing in the world that I should rub, baby it's you

I'm sold out on this love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
Don't hold out on your love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
But for everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else
For everything else, but you

All of these thoughts teach us, follow me to my sleep
Knocking me out my bed, taking away my heap, oh yeah
Running yeah I'm running in circles tryin' to get to your heart
I didn't know it'd be this far
Farther than I've ever gone for you

And I don't care, baby I'm all in there
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
Cause the one thing in the world that I should rub, baby it's you

I'm sold out on this love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
Don't hold out on your love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
But for everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else
For everything else, but you

Running away with my heart on my sleeve
A lotta late nights, always thirty one degrees
Your never...blazing compared to her heart
That's all I ever had, that's what she never got
And what I never got was her, yeah
And what I never got was her

Starts thinking for himself, oh yeah
He's thinking for himself now when your there
Riding in front of the picture in the frame of myself middle of nowhere
He's thinking for himself now when your there
Riding in front of the picture in the frame of myself middle of nowhere

Ush, Ush, get up man
Ush
God
