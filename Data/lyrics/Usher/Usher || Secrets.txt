I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it - oooh but you're lying

How come you're so wrapped up in that anger, let me get you out
You say that nothing can help your situation that I could do, you doubt
How can you be so quick to judge what you can't even see? I mean really
I'm not just something you have from your past, don't blame it all on me
Tell me, let me get ready for the letdown, but I'm not giving up now

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it, girl, but you're lying

What's the problem, something's got you bent out of shape
Cuz I can see that you're hurting, it's written all over your face 
I told you my only objective is to make you smile (ah baby)
But you keep saying I'm interrupting, in the meantime give it a little bit of loving
I'm going to get to the bottom of it

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it - oooh but you're lying

I know you told me that you had enough
And the pain will go away if you feel enough
The only way to make it through another day 
Is to keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting
And when you feel like giving up
And you'll keep searching 'til you find (out) just what to do
You have a right to open up
Baby, there's no way to hide it
Eventually the truth will come out of you

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it, girl, but you're lying
Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it, girl, but you're lying

Ohhh, stop lying girl
