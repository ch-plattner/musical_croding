You gonna say something to the people

Prayer for you
A prayer to you

Do I sound that bad

Just the simple thought of you means everything
To my life you give meaning you're the best
So precious my gift for life
That's why I send you up this prayer
I pray for your protection your covering
That everything intended for you you'll receive
And I'll believe he'll guide you
Lord honor my prayer

Prayer for you
A prayer to you

I pray for yoy

Pray for you

I'll do my best to be there for you every day
To be what my father wish he was to me
Baby I got you
Daddy you'll be there
To encourage you to be the best you can be
You carry my name I pray that you're better than me

I ain't going nowhere
Even when I get on your nerves
Cause I'm your daddy

My prayer for you

Son I pray for you
