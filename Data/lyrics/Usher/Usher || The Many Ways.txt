My lady
You like what you're hearin' baby
What's going on
I've seen you around my way
A couple times
You must have just moved around
The way right
I see all the fellows have been
Pressing you for your number
I'd like to get to know you, so um....
Maybe we can spend some time and
Talk on the phone or something

I can think of many ways to say
I love you
And with those many ways there comes
A time
For me to say I'll put no girls
Before you 
So pretty lady make up your mind

Girl you look surprised

Cause you ain't checkin'
For the kids swing with no
Girl can't we please
Get past impressions
Cause what I feel for you

Your girls tell you watch him
He's an entertainer (entertainer)
They say I'll hurt you and
Break your heart
(Your heart, your heart, but they)
But they don't now well well
Just what I'm feelin'
From the first time I saw you
I loved you from the very start

[Chorus]
I saw you 'rounnd my way
And I had to meet you
But I've got to let you know

With lots of love and patience
