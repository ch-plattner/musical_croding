
Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it:
Is it because he, treated you so badly
I always stand accused
Protecting yourself, from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

[Chorus:]
And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl would I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
Cause girl I'm your man

Just because he did
You swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time
For another man's crime
Girl you know that ain't fair

[Chorus]

I know he did you wrong
But tell me what does that have to do with me
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone..
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse
To pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, and I love you I love you

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse
To pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes
