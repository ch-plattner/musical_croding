Aw! 
This my je ne sais quoi right here
Big town! 
Haha, watch this

If she like it, I love it
If she want it, I got it
I don't concede it, I'm tricking
I do it for my lil' buddy
Some say that it's stuntin'
But I'm on my Mick lushin
I can say that she like it
She ain't used to me buggin'

Girl you kill them like a homicide
Murder she wrote
And I can tell that you ain't even try
They taking on, you choose another, 
that's a waste of time
And that's for sure
If you're dedicated, you can get it

I got that bass for your treble
Turn it up a level
Baby let me call you
Got the game planned
Relax, relax, relax
Do it cuz you can
I can tell that you and your girl want trouble
Got me seeing double
I ain't got a girl, you two need a man
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do it cuz we can, yeah

Pay attention you know that class is in session
Yeah you due for a lesson
Yeah you've been a bad girl
I have to put you on punishment
Your girl say she with it
Then you get extra credit?

I got that bass for your treble
Turn it up a level
Baby let me call you
Got the game planned
Relax, relax, relax
Do it cuz you can
I can tell that you and your girl want trouble
Got me seeing double
I ain't got a girl, you two need a man
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do it cuz we can, yeah
Shall we?

Baby let me call you
Got the game planned
Relax, relax, relax
Do it cuz you can
I can tell that you and your girl want trouble
Got me seeing double
I ain't got a girl, you two need a man
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do that, let's do that
Let's do it cuz we can, yeah
