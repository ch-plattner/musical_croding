Come on
I'm sayin'
You gon' be mine

Fist time I saw you baby
You did something to me
That no else has ever done
Oh - it's something in your eyes
Caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one
Oh - but what's bad is I know you get on man

And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you - Ah baby
Something inside of me
It's saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it you can have it
That why I believe

[Hook]

One day you'll be mine (mine)
No more creepin' , sleepin' around
One day you'll be mine

Now every time I see you baby
It's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missin at
Home baby
So much love to share
It's something in the air
Tellin' me I should never leave you alone
But even through
I know you gotta man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you - Ah baby
You can try to stop it but it won't quit
You say you don't when you know that you want It
I know, one  day well be mine

[Hook]
