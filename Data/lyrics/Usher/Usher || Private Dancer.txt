[1st Verse]
Vicious, from the toes to the lipstick
Who is this? where yo' man at girl? 
Been tryin not to stare..
I shook your left hand,
Just so you see whats on my finger
But what you saw I guess means you don't care

[Bridge]
And I gonna approach this situation, 
With the utmost of precaution,
I don't wanna risk it,
Cos a girl like you don't come too often,

I know this ain't quite what your used to,
But I really need to introduce you to my

[Chorus]
Private Dancer,
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer,
Cos baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

[2nd Verse]
What is a private dancer, you ask
Well you know, my status
But never mind that,
Just gimme a call, 
I want you to dance with me

See a bad one,
Gotta have one,
Bring it back one, one time
My dancer keeps me low key,

[Bridge]
And I approach that situation,
With the utmost of precaution,
I don't wanna risk it,
But a girl like you don't come too often,

I know this ain't quite what your used to,
But I really need to introduce you to my

[Chorus]
Private Dancer,
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer,
Cos baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

[3rd Verse]
My private dancer ain't loud,
Shes never allowed to leave,
I keep her hip to my vibe,
Like a mobile device should beep,

Shes my private life,
My secret, shes so discreet
Give me a call in advance
And ill watch ya dance for me,

[Chorus]
Private Dancer,
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer,
Cos baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

[x2]
So if you gotta private dancer
Go put her up, put her up
And when you,

See a bad one
Gotta have one 
Bring it back one
