What happened to you yeah
From the beginning knew what I was getting
But I was with it, and I'll admit that
Shit was clear it was a kinda thing
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got ahead somethin' got left behind
The world is yours, just sign this dotted line,
And in no time, I had,

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I done had a ball
You can say I've made it
But I'm faded

Cause I miss you
Can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah, come back
Cause I miss you,
Can we go back?
What happened to you
I'm happy for you

Did what I wanted, freaked all the honies
I stayed on they mind, mine was on the money
Had whatever, whenever heart throb forever
Black young and clever

When you give it all, you get it all
Love would be the only reason to look back
And once you turn it on, you can't turn it off
But picture me complaining with all this,

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women
I done had a ball
You can say I've made it
But I'm faded

Cause I miss you
Can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah, come back
Cause I miss you,
Can we go back?
What happened to you
I'm happy for you

What sense does it make to have everything and nothing at the same time...
Where are you?
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you, girl, come and share all this

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women
I done had a ball
You can say I've made it
But I'm faded

Cause I miss you
Can we go back?
(one too many, two at a time)
But the issue is time we can't get back
(time we can't get back now)
What happened to you, yeah, (would you) come back
(oh, baby)
Cause I miss you,
Can we go back?
What happened to you
I'm happy for you

I'm happy for you, wherever you are
