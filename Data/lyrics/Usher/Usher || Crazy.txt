
I'm crazy, so crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy so crazy, about you
(Crazy 'bout you baby)

What kind of love is this
That keeps me hypnotized - cant' get you off
My mind
Don't ever let it end - let it go on and on and on
Cause you know it turns me on

Whisper in my ear, just what I want to hear
Cause no one can love me like you do
Ohh that's why I am
Crazy...

[Chorus]
I'd like to take this time
To tell you how I feel - to let you know the deal
So baby, let's make plans
I want you to be my only girl
Cause you know I'll be your man

[Chorus]

I'm crazy - about you

[Chorus]
