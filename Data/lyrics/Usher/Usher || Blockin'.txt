This is for them girls on the block
This is for them girls that be on the block
(Ooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh)

She fly first class, and she keep a fresh look, you weave back
I can't lie, godamn you bad, damn you bad
When she step up on the scene with her straight black jeans
And her friend got class, that kind of girl to make her whole clique get mad
A dime piece, you could sit a cup on her ass
So now I'm trynna get past her girl and get up in her world

Baby I don't wanna waste your time, I'm just here for your girlfriend
Yeah mm yeah you fine, but I'm just trynna meet your girlfriend
Nice hair, nice eyes, fat ass, tight thighs, so am I
You wish I was leavin with you, but I'm here for your girlfriend

She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
You asked for her girl's number but she gave you hers
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
Everytime you go to pitch, she throws you curves
She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin

She screams everything I ask
Man she don't hesitate to put a girl on blast
I leave a message and she calls right back
Ooh, I can't seem to get past her schemes and nooo
Girl I really don't know what to doo
Girl you really know I'm feelin youuu
You ain't trippin, naw anyway be dippin

I really don't wanna waste your time, I'm just here for your girlfriend
Yeah baby yeah you fine, but I'm checkin for your girlfriend
Nice hair, nice eyes, fat ass, tight thighs, so am I
I know you wish I was leavin with you, but I'm here for your girlfriend
Stop blockin me

She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
You asked for her girl's number but she gave you hers
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
Everytime I go to pitch, she throws me curves
She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin

Now maybe I-I-I gotta let go
Now men have travelled this road many times before
All these stops signs I be have ignored
I can almost taste her, wish I could erase her
Fence after fence, wall after wall
I huff and I puff, hopin that she falls
It's either give her something or give nothing at all
I really wanna quit but her girl is the shit

She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
You asked for her number but she slipped and gave you hers
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
Everytime I go to pitch, she throws me curves
She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin
She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin
