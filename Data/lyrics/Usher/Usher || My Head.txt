
Why do I feel so lonely? 
Even though, you’re laying beside me 
Holding’ me, a part of you isn’t there 
And I can’t sleep knowing that there’s something so different 
There’s something you’re not saying 
Baby I’m scared 
Cause I deserve to be cheated on, 
I deserve to be left alone 
(I can’t believe you love me like that) 
Cause every time that I did you wrong 
You let me come back home 
And I can’t understand why you gave me those 

Chances (ooh) chances 
Gave me so many of them 
And I took advantage of them 
We’re going through 
Changes (oooh changes) changes 
But I’m not ready for them 
So please don’t tell me it’s the end of us 
(These changes, they breaking my heart, they breaking my heart, they breaking my heart) 

And now my conscience is killing me 
Before I was afraid of you leaving 
Now I think that you cheating 
I can see all the signs 
It’s breaking me 
Apart to know that you been lying 
Right to my face, girl 
I can read inbetween the lines 

Cause I deserve to be cheated on, 
I deserve to be left alone 
(I can’t believe you love me like that) 
Cause every time that I did you wrong 
You let me come back home 
And I can’t understand why you gave me those 

Chances (ooh) chances 
Gave me so many of them 
And I took advantage of them 
We’re going through 
Changes (oooh changes) changes 
But I’m not ready for them 
So please don’t tell me it’s the end of us 

I got this paranoid feeling 
That I can’t avoid 
You say I’m tripping 
But I think you’re pushing me away 
And I’m so sorry for 
All the wrong I did before 
I wish that our love could stay the same 
Why’d you give me those… 

Chances, (those chances), chances
Gave me so many of them 
And I took advantage of them 
Now we’re going through 
Changes (oooh changes) changes 
But I’m not ready for them 
So please don’t tell me it’s the end of us

Chances, chances
Changes, changes
