
Oh no, no, no, no, no, oh baby

I'll make it right
Baby you know that I can make it right

Keep it on a cutie girl cause I'm really into you yeah
Tell me is there a way that i can spend some time with you
So much I wanna know about you
Seems like I can't do without you
You really turn me on you got it goin' on
Anything you ask i'll do for you
So baby don't you see
You mean the world to me
Just one thing I have to know
Baby can I make it right

[Chorus]

As I'm looking into your eyes all I see is you lovely face
And there's nothin' I like more than to show you I adore
The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little
Things you say
Baby when I kiss your lips it really brightens up my day
Oh Oh Oh
Anything you ask I'll do for you
You mean the world to me
Just one thing I have to know
Baby can I make it right

[Chorus]

So baby don't you see you mean the world to me
If you just swing my way
I'll make it right
So tell me where do we go from here
Oh yeah

There's nowhere that we can go
But take it nice and slow
Baby enjoy the flow
Lots of pleasures I can give
I've got it waitin' here
So put away your fears

[Chorus]
