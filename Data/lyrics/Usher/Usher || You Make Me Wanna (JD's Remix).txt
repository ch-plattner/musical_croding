So So Def
Get 'em up, get 'em up (what?)
This is what you do
Remix
Get 'em up, get 'em up (what?)

If you saw me and you
In the drop top Benz baby
What would ya do?
Say it all depends
No, it don't
What you want
That's all it's about
You could say whassup?
And keep steppin', cut
And turn us both out
See all I'm tryin' to do
Is make you party rock
Nonstop, trucks by the fly
Cubans with the rocks
Superior yachts
Inspired to stay hot
The hell wit cher block
I got the radio on loud
What?

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how

[1] - You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things it come along with
You make me 

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationwship with you
(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things it come along with 
You make me, you make me

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Cuz I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Repeat 1]

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And if she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me, make me 

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)
You make me wanna
You makin' me

[Repeat 1 until fade]
