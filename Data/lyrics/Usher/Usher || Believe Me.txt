Nobody has ever loved me like you do
That's just something I'm not used to
So I always push you away
Even though I know I want you to stay with me

I know I was the one who made you love me
I know just when you was beginning to trust me
I do it all again (do it all again)
Hit her up again (her her up again)
And you don't deserve it
She ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart (my heart)
To know I breaked you're heart (your heart)
Believe me

I tried to apologize
But I heard you one too many times (baby)
I had no reason why
I just continued to make it right

I know I was the one who made you love me
I know just when you was beginning to trust me
I do it all again (do it all again)
Hit her up again (her her up again)
And you don't deserve it
She ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart (my heart)
To know I breaked you're heart (your heart)
Believe me

I know
I hurt you so many times
I tried to change it
But I can't in this point of my life
And I don't want to lie to you
But I always lie to you
I don't want to lie to you
But I always lie to you

Sometimes it happens that way
It happens that way
Girl I hate that it happens that way
But it happens that way
Ohhh

I know I was the one who made you love me
I know just when you was beginning to trust me
I do it all again (do it all again)
Hit her up again (her her up again)
And you don't deserve it
She ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart (my heart)
To know I breaked you're heart (your heart)
Believe me
