
Hey
I feel like I just blow on up
Anytime I could just lose control, caught up
In your lovin' everytime I feel your touch
Second thoughts more doubts started buildin' up
You're everything I wanted
Before I knew just what I wanted
And hey, hey
You're killin' me on the inside
And you're the only one I want
I can't deny

Don't know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I
Take your hand or let go (do I)
Take your hand or let it go (I can't)
Take this feelin' much more (do I)
Take your hand or let go (go)
Don't know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I go

Hey
I feel like I just blow on up
Everytime I feel your love
I get so caught up
It's your kissin', your touch
It's just everything
But I'm feelin' like I wanna just run away
I'm here to tell you what I want
But you're everything I want
And hey, hey
It's killin' me on the inside
Cuz you're all I ever wanted
So I can't deny

Don't know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I
Take your hand or let go (do I)
Take your hand or let it go (I can't)
Take this feelin' much more (do I)
Take your hand or let go (go)
Don't know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I go

Somebody tell me
Is it that I'm  so hung I can't say
Or is it my life
So young, careless ways
And in your eyes
So much love you wanna give
But the more I hold you in my arms
The pressure starts to build (build)
Build it up (build, build, build)

Don't know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I
Take your hand or let go (do I)
Take your hand or let it go (I can't)
Take this feelin much more (do I)
Take your hand or let go (go)
Dont know what to do
What to say
I'm not sure what to tell you
Confused, which way do I
Take your hand or let go
Take your hand or let it go
Take your hand or let go
Take your hand or let it go
Take your hand or let go
Take your hand or let it go
Take your hand or let go
Take your hand or let it go
Take your hand or let go
Take your hand or let go
