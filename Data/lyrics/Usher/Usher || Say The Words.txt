
I had a dream when I was just a little boy
To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park at school
And talk till the day was through
Then you took me to your parents' house
And I would comb your hair
And we would dream of all the cities
And places we could go

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns to night.

I can still remember dreams as a little boy
Now I'm man, and still can't put down my toys
Hey, hey, hey
Real love it will never come, if you in it now
But I had to learn that lesson down in the south
After spending nights in the town just to have a little fun
In my mind I'm wishing she's the one
(I said to myself)
Is this to close to reality
For you to be that girl from my fantasy

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns to night.

She stole my head and let's go play the dream again
Uh, uh, to find a girl like you
(Only you and me around!)
I look into your eyes
I'm not seeing universe
(You and I are intertwined)
I look into your eyes
I'm not seeing universe
(You and I are intertwined)
Love is pure!

[Chorus x2]
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay till the day turns to night.

This is dedicated from the fire we'll rise
to my one and only ever love
I would never, ever, ever love again

This is dedicated (you know who you are)
to my one and only ever love (only girl I ever loved)
