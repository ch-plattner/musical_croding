[Usher:]
Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold
Ans she move like she learn everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out till the morning better ask somebody

[Talking:]
Yo, talk to the girl walk here's the round (oh)
Watch what happen to you when she hear the sound (yo)
Tell her shake it up, tell hit the ground (yo)
Gonna face time see if she's down

[Usher:]
She's a girl from the future 
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man you only know if you know cause she's

[Chorus:]
A hot thing
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
(Oh, dang she's so bubblicious)

[Usher:]
Seen her amazing she stopped and pose
When she seen the green one she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Buggati, got money in your pocket
That makes you a really poppa with me on up on it

[Talking:]
Yo, talk to the girl walk here's your round (yeah)
Watch what will happen to you when she hear the sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
(Yo) gonna face time, see if she's down

[Usher:]
She say you must have money in your wallet till the thing don't fall
And this is credit cards black not gold
Now you only know if you know

[Chorus:]
For real she's a hot thing
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)

[A$AP Rocky:]
Fly young hot thing girl lemme cool off
GQ status wouldn't fuck me with my suit on
She a fashion killer and you know 
I am a shoe hog Christian Louis Vitton red bottoms
Gives me blue balls
She fuck me like she know me, and fuck me like she owe me
She told me the she showed me,then she cuddle like she lonely
All for the love, for the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony and pimping like Goldie
How ya doing, I' the motherfucking man
True hot boy catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl so she's running with the name
Drop it like it's hot on my motherfucking thing
Mommy like calata, Papi like the merci-gallardo

When I hit the verser if you let me menage
I'll take you to see Usher

[Talking:]
Talk to the girl walk here's your round
Watch what will happen to you when she hear the sound
Tell her shake it up, tell hit the ground (yo)
Gonna face time see if she's down

[Usher:]
She said it don't really take to much to get me out of control
Baby, you stop this my show

[Chorus:]
