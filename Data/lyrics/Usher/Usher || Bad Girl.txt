Sho nuff
Shawty
What it do?
Oh
Pimpin', oh boy
uh

What y'all know about a supermodel
Fresh outta Elle magazine
Buy her own bottles
Look pimp juice, I need me one
Bad than a mutha
I hear you sayin'
I need a bad girl
If you're a bad girl

Players when you see me
Act like you know me
I keep a dollar worth of dimes
You know pimpin' ain't easy
For all my chicks in the club
Who knows how to cut a rug
If you're a bad girl
Get at me bad girl

[Chorus]
Ooh work me baby
Shakin' it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me bad girl
What sexy lady's comin' home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (super bad baby)
Get at me bad girl

Now I've seen a lot of broads
All on one accord
Everyone looked the same but
Take a look at my dame (my dame)
Fo' sho', she take that Hypnotic or Alize
There ain't much more I can say but (I need a)
I need a bad girl (bad girl)
If you're a bad girl

Got one thou' on the bar now
Chick need a drink on the flo' now
Look at them bad girls movin' it
Makin' faces while they doin' it
Oh, I wanna take one to the restroom
So close I'm smellin' like your perfume
If you're a bad girl
Get at me bad girl

[Chorus]
Ooh work me baby
Shakin' it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me bad girl
What sexy lady's comin' home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (super bad baby)
Get at me bad girl

I'mma get one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh
Get at me bad girl
I'mma get one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh
Get at me bad girl

If you wanna party
I got what you lookin' for
Come see me in the V.I.P. for bad company
It's very necessary
To be that kinda girl for me
If you are, then baby come
Let's leave

[Chorus]
Ooh work me baby
Shakin' it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me bad girl
What sexy lady's comin' home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (super bad baby)
Get at me bad girl

[x2]
I'mma get one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh
Get at me bad girl
I'mma get one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh
Get at me bad girl

Callin' all girls around the world
Yeah, get bad
If you're out there I wanna see you
If you hear me get at me
Bad girls around the world
Yeah, stay bad if you're out there
I wanna see you if you hear me
Get at me bad girl
