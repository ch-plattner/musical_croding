[Verse:]
There's a long and windy road that we have traveled
And the price that waits for all who will preveal
There's a place for those who stand up tall and battle
Up against our lives determine that to fail
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready 
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before (never before)
So write your name beside the very best in history and take a bow
Before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you

[Chorus:]
Just keep dreamin
Keep on dreamin (gotta believe)
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
(uh just keep dreamin)
Keep dreamin don't stop dreamin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

[Verse:]
So you rise above each uteral you encounter
Let no obstacles before you slow your speed
Or you possess a will to win them burn insincely 
And when you will yes this will be your creep ohh
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready 
To push yourself much harder then you sone before (never before)
So write your name beside the very best in history
And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you (take it from me)

[Chorus:]
Just keep dreamin
Keep on dreamin
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
Keep dreamin don't stop dreamin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

[Bridge:]
And in the end with no regrets you given your all and nothing left
You know you been the best that you can be
No one can say you didn't try
Go on and wave your better high
And save a that sweet taste of victory (ohhh yea)

[Chorus:]
Dreamin keep on dreamin (ain't no stopping you)
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true (that's if you want it)
Keep dreamin don't stop dramin
Cause no one else can live a dream but you
Just go ahead and live a dream

[Hook:]
Anything in life can happen if you give your best in all you do
(Ain't no living) Ain't no living for those who want it
Keep a chance and let it all come true
Shake your fears and hold your head high
You can make it if you really try 
Cause no one else can live a dream but you

[Chorus:]
Dreamin keep on dreamin
And if you really believe in time you will make your dreams come true
