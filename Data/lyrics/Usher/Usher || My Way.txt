[JD Talking]
Yo See,it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all ya'll other (look) out there doin' what I'm doin'
Or tryin' to do what i'm doin' but you can't
Cause i do it my way
What about you
Huh,huh Come On
[Usher Singing]
I Do
Any & everything you want to
Make your girl say ooh ooh
Why's he so fly
She beeps me,whenever she wanna get freaky
You can get if you want too
Say whatever you want be she still gon' give it up 
Cause she likes it..

[Chorus] 
She likes it my way,My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
My Way, My Way
What i say goes,and i'm in control
[JD Rapping]
Bad ass senorita's, two seaters with kicks
New kick's all in the mix
Don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catchin' bricks don't concern me
So forget lil' midget, My mind on 7 digits
Before i pay heaven's skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pullin' all stops 
Sayin' you can't front [Usher sings] on me
[JD finish's rapping]
So from this day forth you know i'm all about the heat
and what u do is the major league
That's why your girlfrien's paging me
and she know like he know, you don't see her like i see her
So she's out the do'
[Usher sings as JD Raps]
Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, systen bassun
Conversation [Usher stops singing JD continues to rap]
and facin' me sayin' give it to me know baby

[Chorus]
My Way, My Way
You can't satisfy her needs
 she keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What i say goes and i'm in control

[2nd verse]
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far then, ooh wee
She had to have every chance that she could get
But you think you a baller
and i ain't gon' call her
Clip that, you can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' give it up
Cause she likes it..

[Chorus]
My Way, My Way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way 
What i say goes and i'm in control

My, Way, My Way (I do any & everything you want to)
You can't satisfy her needs 
she keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way (I do any & everything you want to ohh)
What i say goes and i'm in control
[Continues until it fades]
