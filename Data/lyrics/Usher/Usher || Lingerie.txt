[Talkin':] 
Yo This Yo boi Pleasure 
Providing pleasure 
To all you sexy ladies 
In your silk and your lace 
And your lingerie 
Don't forget your pumps 
And your lipgloss 
All that good stuff 
Light the candles baby 
Cause Pleasures here 

[Verse:] 
On the phone (on the phone), 
With you girl (with you girl) 
Just now leaving (just now leaving) 
The studio (the studio) 
I know it is (I know it is) 
After hours (after hours) 
Please get up (please get up) 
Jump in the shower (jump in the shower) 
Rub some lotion (rub some lotion) 
On your body (on your body) 
Then throw on (then throw on) 
Something sexy (something sexy) 
I know you got it (know you got it) 
In your closet (in your closet) 
Maybe in your dresser (maybe in your dresser) 
Make it special (make it special) 

[Chorus:] 
Throw on some lingerie baby 
I'm talking about silk and lace baby 
we can do it all night (we can do it all night) 
we can do the slow grind, we can do the slow grind [x2] 

[Bridge:] 
Slow motion on you girl 
Slow motion on you girl 
roller coasting on you girl 
I want to take you up and down like a merry-go-round [x2]
