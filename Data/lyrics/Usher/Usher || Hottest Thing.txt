
I've been looking at you
Turning brothers down
Some got their song
Well its time for me to holla now
(Your body is calling, don't fight it)
Ooh I like it

You're dancing all alone
What's that all about?
You're so fine
But it's time for me to call you out
(Watch out, I'll straight run up on ya)
Girl I want ya

You're the hottest thing
In the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly
To the break dawn
We can shake the spot
If you say it's on

Dancing so close
Got me up like whoa
We're doing the most
Is living with you possible?
(Your body is saying you want to)
And I want you, oh baby
More than you know sugar
If only for one night
I'll make you feel
Like you've been to paradise
It's all up to you - tell me something baby
I know one thing

You're the hottest thing
In the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly
To the break dawn
We can shake the spot
If you say it's on

You're the hottest thing
In the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly
To the break dawn
We can shake the spot
If you say it's on

Baby tell me
What's on your mind?
Do you think that I'm being too forward
Oh baby by coming at you, this way
I can't help myself, you're... 

You're the hottest thing
In the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly
To the break dawn
We can shake the spot
If you say it's on
