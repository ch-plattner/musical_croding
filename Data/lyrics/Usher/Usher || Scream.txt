Usher, baby
Yeah, yeah, we did it again
And this time I'mma make you scream

Usher! Yeah, man...

I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby,
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Got no drink in my hand
But I'm wasted
Getting drunk of the thought of you naked
I'd get you like
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby,
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby

And I've tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax, and get on your back

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream

Yeah, come on

Kill the lights, shut 'em off
You're electric
Devil eyes telling me, "Come and get it."
I'll have you like
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Girl tonight you're the prey
I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me whispering in your ear
That I wanna take off all your clothes and put something on ya

And I've tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax, and get on your back

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Yeah, ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream...

Out louder, scream (Usher) louder (if you wanna scream)
Louder, louder, louder, louder
Hey, somebody scream out with me (if you wanna scream)

[Beat break]

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream
