On the wall
Who is the greatest motherfucker
Of them all?

Better yet, no you don't gotta answer that
Cause I know just who that is
Oh yes, that's me
Yeah yeah that's me

And I'm a record breaker cause I put in the time
...
Oh, I ain't got to fight for it cause it's already mine
cause I've been around

I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy
You know you can't keep me in your eyesight
Just for a moment you can call it a night

You're not in my radar
You're not in my radar
You're not even in my radar

I'm in my all black suit
Feeling like the James Bond
(I got so many chicks, they get my swagger, they want me to get with them yeah)

When I make my fingers go
You better know that means that I
That means that when you step up in this Porsche Carrera, better not touch anything, because

And I'm a record breaker cause I put in the time
On the test drive, come take a ride
And if I was that type of guy
I would correct this girl was mine

Yeah, I put it down

I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy
And if you can keep me in your eyesight
Just for the moment
We can call it a night

You might be in my radar
You could get up in my radar
...
See you trying to get in my radar
Yeah

I'm usually not on this family tale tip
But I got to say
Imagine the city under the stars
...

I can tell you want me
So I might save you for the night

I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy
And if you can keep me in your eyesight
Just for the moment
We can call it a night

You might be in my radar
You could get up in my radar
You might be in my radar
...
