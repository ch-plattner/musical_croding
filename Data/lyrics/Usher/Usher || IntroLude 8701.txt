Man it's been a long time coming
But I never forgot about you
I'm here
Yeah, we've traveled the world
Seen a lot of places, so many faces
We had a good time - we've grown together
Who would've thought we'd stay down this long, heh?
This is my chance to share my world with you
And I know you're gonna like it
Are you ready?
