[Usher]
Let me put my shades on
Everybody come around

[Pre-Chorus:]
You got it twisted
Now tell me why you wanna do me that way
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play

You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted it, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I suffer from delusion, I should put myself way

[Verse 1:]
All the time and money I've spent
Can't believe what I'm in, it ain't right
If I comeback, you promise it's gon be you and me
And that's it?
"Whatever..."
No?

[Pre-Chorus:]
You got it twisted
Now tell me why you wanna do me that way
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play

You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted it, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I suffer from delusion, I should put myself away

How come I every time I coo around
Just so happen you around, you got it showed out
It ain't right, uh
And all that flinging your hair
Glossing your lips, shaking your hips
Every time you go out

[Pre-Chorus:]
You got it twisted
Now tell me why you wanna do me that way
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play

You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted it, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I suffer from delusion, I should put myself away

[Pharrell]
Hey all the girls, all the girls
Make sure your skirt ain't too tight
What we doing, is gon have a lot of fun
With me and you, tonight, come on

[Usher]
You gotta twist it to the left
And twist it to the right
(Go head and) Twist it like you love it
Yeah! Twist that thang all night
You gotta twist it to the left
And twist it to the right
(Go head and) Twist it like you love it
Yeah! Twist that thang all night

[Pharrell]
She felt so alive, said her home life was so dead
20 of us on vespas and mopeds, oh there she go now
Oh can I hold that, what you talking about go head for here
Told her home girl, now it's getting worser and I was trying to hook her
Up with ursher
So I gave her that white Chanel lipstick, She said how you get more,
I said, "Twist it."

You got it twisted
Now tell me where you wanna do me, damn right
You got it twisted
You introduced shit, you know I don't play

You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted it, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I suffer from delusion, I should put myself away

[Usher]
Oh yeah, I see you
Keep twisting baby
She can't ever get enough...
