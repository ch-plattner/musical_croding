Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know (wanna know, wanna know)
Yeah I been running but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway (anyway, anyway)
You make my heart beat keep pumping
Why the hell you turn it up so loud?

Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

[Beat break]

Here we are, we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

I already know the way and thought I could get in and out
She said, "Relax, you gonna be here for a while"
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is I'm learning to loving
And I ain't gonna turn it down

The fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I've seen it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

[Beat break]

Here we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

[Beat break]

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I've seen it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
