I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill, only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long Time

Some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well is that really insanity
Or just a losers' game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb

I can feel you now
(Numb)
(Numb)

I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

But you can't feel it, do ya?
(Numb)

Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
(Numb)

I can feel you now
(Numb)
I can feel you now
(Numb)
I can feel you now

Can you feel it?
