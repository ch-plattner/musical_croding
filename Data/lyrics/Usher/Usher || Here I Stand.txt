
I'm hopin that this ain't too hard to believe
Cause baby you're the only one for me
I know it get hard when im moving in and out of state
But I promise my heart for you I would save
Just remember that..

No matter how far I go 
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby)

You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen (My queen)
And finally now i know just what that means (Oh Yeah)
You're the blessing I never thought I would get
And to the Lord I humbly bow my head
Just remember that..

No matter how far I go 
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby)

Every since you came (since you came along)
It seems like (couldn't get it right)
I fell and sunk so low, that there' was no way I could be found (never thought love would find me)
And when we make love (Everytime you give, whoo, give to me your love)
Give..you make me feel a way I never felt no one else, and I can't help myself
I'm tellin you that..

No matter how far I go (Yeah)
And no matter how long it takes (Yeah)
No one or nothing,nothin' babe can ever change, the way I feel, cause I'm yo man, Listen..see
Forever yours, yours,all yours here I stand (Yeah)

No matter how far I go 
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby)

Forever yours..I am..here I stand
