Ooh, yeah baby yeaah
Uhhuhhuhhuhhmmm
Yeaah babe
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah
Listen up I got a story to tell
Check it out now
And I know you can identify with this one
Yeah yeah yeah, oh

Figured I'd hit it and quit it just one night
Got so good to me doubled back twice, I
Musta been outta my mind
Knowin' I don't wanna
I'm about to nut up
Guess it's too late to turn back now
Can't apologize cuz that ain't my style
Shorty rainin' wet
Up in my ear talkin' 'bout
I got what you came for
This here got your name on it

Go on and hit it
That's what it's made for
We got protection
That's what it's made for
Boo why you trippin' now
You know i got it
That's what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

Game rules, no cap no cut
But even Superman couldn't turn your love down, I
Slipped up, slipped in
Hey man what the hell you doin?
Raw dog is a never
I know I know better
Heard her whisper
Don't worry I'm safe
Didn't matter cuz it's already to late
I was lost in the sauce, dead wrong
And I ain't stoppin' now
Parleein' in the bush again
Didn't think about what I was puttin' in it

Go on and hit it
That's what it's made for
She said, "You got somethin on right?"
That's what it's made for
Boo why you trippin'
You know I got it
Thats what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

Best stay where you are
That's what it's made for
Playa playa put it down
That's what it's made for
Oh baby turn around
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

[Usher and girl speaking]

[Girl:] Mm mm, you ain't gotta go nowhere
[Usher:] Look baby I, something's comin' up, I gotta--

[Girl:] I want you to sweat it all out
[Usher:] I'mma get it baby
[Girl:] Get it, take it
[Usher:] Ok
[Girl:] Take it
[Usher:] I'mma get up inside

That's what it's made for (that's what it's made for)
That's what it's made for
Don't trip, I got protection
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
I'm gon' do you like this, baby
Oh you gon' freak you like this
Felt it like this
We gon' still get down like this
That's what it's made for
Oh, playa playa put it down
That's what it's made for
Too late to turn back now
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
Do you like this
Freak you like this
Felt it like this
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

And thats only the beginning (God)
I might as well just go to sleep here (damn)
