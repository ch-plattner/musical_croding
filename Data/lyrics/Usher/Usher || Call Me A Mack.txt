[Usher speaking]

Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher,
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house,
And if U really wanna know what my name is
Just Call Me A Mack
Word,
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby,
Cause I ain't confused

[Usher singing]

I maybe kind of young
But I got a
Whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't be played (Huh, ha!)
I don't mind
If U wanna come by my crib
And chill,
But just be sure
That U call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned how to play a player
And do U know why,
Because the mack

[Hook]

Just Call Me A Mack
Cause I got it like that
U gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with U
It's a well known fact
That I got it like that
U gotta play by the rules
Just Call Me A Mack

Now, baby I ain't dumb
And all those silly
Games that U play
I see right through
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)
I don't have a lot of girls,
But I gotta know
I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live
Because the last girl
I had was moving
Things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to fool a fooler
And do U know
What had happened

[Hook (twice)]

[Usher's Rap]

The mack is right here
And yes I care as much
Just giving a little love
It's spreading everywhere
U see it's
Here
Here
And here
Catch a feeling
I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always
Hit it
Pit it
Like an orange
Cause it looks
Like numbness
My lovin' and
Hugin'
And bitterness
My peeps keep
Pumpin'
Humpin'
On stage
I'm engaged
And yes
The truth is it
U see an
Ugly woman
U better change

[Usher singing]

Oh, yes
Like Usher's my name
I can't go changing
My ways (Oh, no)
As long as I'm chillin'
Then baby
U can call me the mack

[Hook (3 times)]
