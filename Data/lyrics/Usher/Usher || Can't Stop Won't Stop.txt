I Can't Stop Won't Stop
Usher baby
Yeah, will you do it again?
Can't Stop Won't Stop

Hey, what's up, this is a jam
Turn it up, play it loud in the club
There's this fire, you're burning me up
Oh girl, yeah girl, I've been looking around the world
And right when I saw you I fell in love
And I want you forever, and ever, and ever

I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't, can't, Stop it
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't Stop Won't Stop
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't, can't, Stop it
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't Stop Won't Stop

Can't Stop Won't Stop

Can't Stop Won't Stop, girl you are my sugar shop
Love you like a lollipop, from the bottom to the top
I'm get you wet, raincoat, let me be your body soap
Up and down, roller-coaster, we can love forever
You can call me papa, you my freaky mama
Mami be my doctor, work on my body girl
Oh yeah right now operate on me whenever
You're my sexy operator

You can't stop now, you can't stop now, you can't stop now
Don't stop now, don't stop now, keep it going now
Drop it ooh now

Hey, what's up, this is a jam
Turn it up, play it loud in the club
There's this fire, you're burning me up
Oh girl, yeah girl, I've been looking around the world
And right when I saw you I fell in love
And I want you forever, and ever, and ever

I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't, can't, Stop it
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't Stop Won't Stop
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't, can't, Stop it
I Can't, can't, Stop it, I Can't Stop Won't Stop

You came here, won't quit
Girl you are... I know that you freaky girl
I keep your secret, them other ladies don't mean nothing
You're my favorite chick, I don't like them groupie hoes
Baby you're my dear
You can call me big daddy, let me call you all the time
Let me make you laugh, take them problems off your mind
Cause I don't wanna do all the normal things that all these other normal dudes do

You can't stop now, you can't stop now, you can't stop now
Don't stop now, don't stop now, keep it going now
Drop it ooh now

Turn it up, oh this is on fire
Burn it up,
I've been looking around the world
Right when I saw your face girl
I can't stop it now
I Can't Stop Won't Stop
