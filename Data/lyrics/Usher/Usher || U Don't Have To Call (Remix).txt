[Intro: Usher]
Yo after tonight....Don't leave your girl around me
True playa for real ask my nigga Pharrell

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Man I'm a playa girl you don't have to call
Six gees in my socks so I have to ball
Luda, without words I'll let the beat break her
Then hit the liquor store and them switzer sweet makers
Yeah, me and some friendly friend friends
Close as the hairs on my chinney chin chin
I'm a be aight tonight we down south
But I plan to get head straight up like Alfalfa

[Usher]
Situations will arise,in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I...I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I,I...Thought the world of U
but your so steady still leavin baby

[Chorus: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2: Usher]
Aw girl your face is, sayin why
Tears in eyes, should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listenin to friends, now it's the end
And again no story can end without it
Damn ri..i,i,i,ight... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... Thought the world of U
But you're so steady still leavin baby

[Chorus: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 3: Usher]
Gonna boogie....tonight, cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does

[Ludacris]
Damn what's with all the long faces?
You're lookin for love in all the wrong places
Let's hit clubs and girls will take a shirt off
If not for me for the raspberry smirnoff
Then me and Ursher can knock 'em all
Then we up and disappear like socks and draws
A Town!!!! Hit the block and get rowdy
We puttin up A's like Summa Cum Laude
Yeah I graduated at the top of the class
And yeah I strap a harnest to the top of yo ass
And I told 'em before the parties don't stop
So like Ripley's you believe it or not
And when you don't realize I'm the best ya had
Now you sittin at home and you got it bad
Yo! I'm a get mine and move slow
So drink some prune juice and let the shit go

[Usher]
And that's party!!!

[Chorus: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Bridge]
I'm alri-ight-ight
Gonna boogie....tonight, cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does...
and that's party!!!

[Chorus: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
