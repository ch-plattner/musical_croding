
Oh ooh yeah ah oh yeah
La La La La La La La
Smile again 
Just smile again
I'll always be there for you
What can I do to make you smile again
Just smile again

I'd like to know what's on your mind
Because I see you crying all the time
I don't understand
Who'd wanna hurt your heart like this and
Cause you so much pain
Here's my shoulder
You can lean on me
I wanna see you happy
(I want to see you happy
Why not just let me make you smile again)

[Chorus]
Just wanna see you smile
How I can ease the pain you feel
What can I do to take the tears away
Baby talk to me
You say he's hurt you many times
But now that's over let me take his place
Your problems I'll erase
You need someone that you can depend on
To brighten up every day (every day) oh yeah
I am the one that you been searchin' for
And all you have to do is
Smile again for me yeah
(Smile again for me)

Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Smile again
Just smile again

Let me love you
I can show you
Just what it means to me
Please smile for me
