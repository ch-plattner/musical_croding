Yeah, uhh
They say money can't buy you love
They say money can't buy you love
They never seem to listen
I'm all ears

Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex
But you can never find the time to spend at home
Thinkin' it's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

So you think that you know what's important
Steady chasin' your fame and your fortune
But you don't know
You're chasing a dime losin' a treasure
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all
Ooh, it goes

Duh da duh da
You give her spending money
Duh da duh da
But all she wanna spend is time alone (tonight)
Keep givin' her
The finer things but
But she don't really need that
If you don't stop you're
You're gonna end up alone (alone)
The world without love (duh duh da duh da)
Why would you do it

[Chorus x2]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it (listen)

Stop tryna buy her love
'cuz you won't ever have enough
There's always someone with more than you
You need to pay her attention
Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah
Yeeeah yeah
Play on playa
Yeah
Your girl comin' wit' me shorty, haha
I'm tellin' you man
'cuz u know

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

You better look out
I hear you talkin', i hear you talkin' (ha)
But what are you saying
Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool
You got a good thing
Man are you blind
Stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing (uh)
You got a good thing
If that's your lady
You better hold on
And give her what she want
Before she move on
Man I tell you cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kickin it baby

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated
Searching for whats right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Fade]
Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no
It's right there, it's right there
