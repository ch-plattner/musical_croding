Yo, check this here

So why don't we just chill and make a cold cold sexy.

And I know you're gonna like it
Ooh baby, U sure love to....

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse1]
We been hang out every day this week
How 'bout'a n....fix U somthing to eat
And just chill
We anit gotta wild out just chill
Parlay little momma right here
Sippin' on chardonnay
Slip on that Vicki Secret lingerie
'Cause I anit tryin' to throw my money away (in the streets)
If I can see U twork it out for me

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out
Laying in the cut
Kissing rubbing and making sweet love
Dame the club tonight
Lets twork it out
It'll be just me on U from 11 to 6 in the morning
I know U like it when I do U like that
Let's tork it out

Now that I got U all soakin' wet
I bet U know what's commin' next

Kick back in relax come sit up on my lap shorty
Tonight I'm takin' U all the way
Wont stop till U scream my name

[Chorus 2x]

[ Bridge]
Moring is coming and I don't want to let U go
Let's just lay here in this bed of red rose petals
I know that we're spent but
One kiss can make this start all over again
If U want it baby come with me

[Verse3]
It's way too treal
The way U making me feel
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby U sure love to ball
It's way too treal
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby U sure love to ball

[Chorus - Ad Libs]
