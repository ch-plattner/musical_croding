
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh yeah

[Verse One:]
Listen
I'd be a liar if I told you
That I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said
Hey I didn't want it to be something
You deserve much better
For the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it
But girl I swear
That I got love for you
Big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that
You will always be my baby
My baby

But dig the truth
Baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus:]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties cause they both look right
Someone tell me what's a man to do
When he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie
But he can't tell the truth

What's a man to do
When he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart
In two different places
In two different places

I know you feel it cause you stay
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say
I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear

[Verse Two]
I been living on the edge baby
So I guess yea baby
She ain't nothing but she is real
But why take her through it
When I still got love for you
Big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that
You will always be my baby
My baby

But dig the truth
Baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus]

What's a man to do
When he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart
In two different places
Not in two different places

[Hook:]
I wanna tell you it's over
That I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it
That I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that
I ain't playing games and I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror
It's the same old man

[Chorus]

What's a man to do
When he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart
In two different places
Not in two different places
Not in two different places
