Let me turn the lights on (usher baby)

I just want you undivided
You should let me penetrate your... everything
You've got me beyond excited
Baby step into my room I'm your groom
You don't need a wedding ring

I think sex was made for strangers
Making love is for the ones who plan to stay together
How 'bout we embrace the danger
Girl I'm pretty sure that when it's all said and done
We gonna do whole lot of...
We gonna do a whole lot of...
Yeah!

We gonna do a whole lot of... yeah!

Listen,
I'm not into fantasizing
I much rather put my hands on everything
I just hope that I'm invited yeah
Up into your room I'm your groom
But I ain't got a wedding ring

I think sex was made for strangers
Making love is for the ones who plan to stay together
How 'bout we embrace the danger
Girl I'm pretty sure that when it's all said and done
We gonna do whole lot of... (turn the lights on)
We gonna do a whole lot of...
Yeah!

I ain't gotta be your man
You ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go off everything they taught you in this world
We gonna do a whole lot of...

Yeah
Can't deny what's here between us
Right now
I can hear your heart beating
Holding back would be so dangerous

(I know you want to, listen)
We gonna do a whole lot of
You gotta take to for me
We gonna do a whole lot of...
(You know you want to)
Yeah

[Distorted voice:]
I ain't gotta be your man
You ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go off everything they taught you in this world
We gonna do a whole lot of... yeah!

No expectations on the first name bases
Is get together on exchange faces (I'm freakin' you)
Yeah...
