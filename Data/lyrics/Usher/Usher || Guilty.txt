[Usher]
I swear to tell the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
I said
Right hand high, tell a lie

Your honor I didn't no that I hurt her
I didn't know she was crying
I didn't know that it was killing this love
And then your honor she keep saying I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't try
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

[Chorus:]
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty cause girls always want to show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Girl I'm guilty for that girl I'm guilty

Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Ohhh,
Don't take me to jail
I did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that,
Don't take me to jail
Ohhh,
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
I ain't gonna cry while you make me do the time

Your honor she accused me of cheating
It was all in her thinking
She gon believe what she want to
So what the hell am I gon do
Turn my life around, it aint going down
She know bout the life I live why she crying now
This shit is so silly to me but I won't plead that

[Chorus]

Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Ohhh,
How we 'posed to get along with her going through my phone
In her mind she decided I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
Don't want to cop a plea
I swear with me it don't matter cause to her I'm guilty

[T.I.]
Lets go
Right hand to the sky
Strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case well what am I
If I hurt her I ain't try to, in the club I may decide to ride through
She got proof well I got alibi's too
Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
7 carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue
Range Rover Porsche powder mirror in the Bentley coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon listen to
Her life I submit to you is evidence
I never been on bullshit she ain't caught me on no tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me
Should have let me be
I'm balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then

[Chorus]

Don't take me to jail
Ohhh
Don't take me to jail
If you gon treat me like a crook putting money on my books
Never mind forget it
Don't take me to jail (ooh)
Don't take me to jail (take me)
Tired of your little games, I take the blame
I did it, guilty.
