
On the road to the riches,
Try and stop and take pictures
Pay attention to each detour and each sign along the way
Be aware of the winding roads
Know that as long as you take it slow 
You'll be fine 
Plus you'll find 
You're already there

On the road to the riches, don't forget to stop to take pictures
Cause life ain't about where you finish, but what you've learned along the way
So as you chase success remember that I told you best
You look fine, then you'll find 
You're already there

(And that's the truth) 
Go ahead, be you (go 'head, be you)
If you want to be free (want to be free)
First you must be, 
Just be, just be

With the glass half empty at least you know you're not thirsty
Try to see it for what it is
Really half full now take a sip
And as it trickles down let it wash away any doubts 
In your mind
You'll find 

Don't think real joy is in position or money (Noo)
Don't compare your life to somebody else that you don't know
Just what they're going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes
Don't be blind, the sun shines on everybody 

(And that's the truth)
Go 'head be you
(Go 'head be you)
If you want to be free (want to be free)
Then you have to first be (be)
Just be (be)

I know that sometimes life can throw a curve
But you gotta keep on swinging hard
It's the only way to knock one out the park
And if it doesn't make it over the wall
The only way you strike-out is if you don't swing at all

(Mmm... And that's the truth)
Go ahead be you
(Go 'head be you)
If you want to be free (want to be free)
Be (Be)
Just be (be) 

[Repeat]
