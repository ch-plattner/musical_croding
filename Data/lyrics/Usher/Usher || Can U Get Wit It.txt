There's so many thing that I want to do
I promise u when I'm ready
I'm gonna spend my whole life with u

What is love? Is it steady?
Cause I don't know what to do
Tell me girl if you're ready
To do what we came to do

One day we could be together
Cause u know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now we can all forget it
U know I gots to get around

I don't have much money, I can't buy a diamond ring
I'm not tryin' to be funny, but it's only a sexual thing

Can u get wit it
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can u get wit it
It's like that
You're gonna love the joy I bring

Please forgive me cause I don't ever want to rush u
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do

U know our time is really precious
And u wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have 2 keep on movin'
If you can't make up your mind

One day we could be together
Cause u know that I wanna be down
But right now we can all forget it
Cause u know I gots to get around

I don't have much money (don't have none), I can't buy a diamond ring (got a diamond ring)
I'm not tryin' to be funny (nooooooo), it's only a sexual thing

Can u get wit it (Can u get wit it!)
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing (oh, baby yeaaa)
Can u get wit it (oh i know you know how i)
It's like that (i wanna do you baby, yea)
You oughta love the joy I bring

Can u get wit it
It's like that (oohhhhh, yea)
It's only a sexual thing
Can u get wit it (oh baby)
It's like that
You oughta love the joy I bring

(Davante say it again!)

Can u get wit it (Tell me!)
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing (Do you want it, baby, do you want it fast or slow)
Can u get wit it
It's like that (ready baby)
You oughta love the joy I bring (are you ready for me!)

Can u get wit it
It's like that (Come to my room)
It's only a sexual thing (let me take off all your clothes)
Can u get wit it (and make love to you really slow)
It's like that (ooohhh, yea)
You oughta love the joy I bring

Can u get wit it
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can u get wit it (baby,baby)
You oughta love the joy I bring (baby,baby)

Can u get wit it
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can u get wit it
It's like that
You oughta love the joy I bring
