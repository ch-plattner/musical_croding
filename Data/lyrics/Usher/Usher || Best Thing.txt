
What's up Baby, 
Look, I know you don't want me to call you baby right now, 
But I just gotta talk to you about sumat real quick, 
Suprise you even took my call... 
I just gotta few things I gotta, gotta discuss with you... would you mind if I ask you a
question? 

Listen, Is there any chance that you remember me being any more than just a horrible man... 
And would you consider pullin this trigger and taking a second shot at romance
Oh Bbay
I want the days when you were my girl and I was your man, know I took you for granted, 
But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you... 

Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool... yeah
But for once, here goes the truth

I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happend to me
You took my best thing, 
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the... the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress coz when you left you took the very best

Remember mimi or vita, remember isha or eva
I ain't got em no more, hey yes
Niomi or jenny - the same outcome is chillin... 
Girl, I let em all go... 
No more trickin and kissin miscelaenous chicks
Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya... 
How much I miss you

I'm so sorry that I ran the stressts acting like a damn fool
But for once here goes the truth... 

Can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happend to me
You took my best thing, 
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the... the best thing that I ever had
And now I'm all out with this stress coz baby when you left you took the very best... 

I couln't see how good it was until I could'nt see you no more
Why did I have to act like that
Damn right girl I want you back
Acting like a G, straight M-A-C and P-I-M-P
Got my arms empty
In the night time
And that's the right time
When I got time

Listen to what's on my mind
I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happend to me
You took my best thing, 
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the... the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress coz when you left you took the very best
