Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that

[Verse 1]
Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Everytime you called I told you,
"Baby I'm working." (No!)
I was out doing my dirt (Oh!)
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (just listen)
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
But you probably believe you got a good man
I man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself
It ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
if I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would
stead of everything being all bad beby everything will be all good
I don’t wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you ain't gonna’ make you wanna stay, probably just make you run away or
mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it
I know, today is the day that I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit
Girl, I'm sorry baby I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confess...

[Chorus]

Can you break it down....

[Harmonica playing]

[Chorus fades out]
