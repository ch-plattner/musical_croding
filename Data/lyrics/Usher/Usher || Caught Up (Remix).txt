[USHER]
I'm the kind of brotha
Who been doin' it my way
Gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life
I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems shes got me twisted
I'm so 
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girls got a hold on me

Let me go baby
Now listen
My momma told me
Be careful who you do cuz karma comes back around
Same ol' song
But I was so sure
That it wouldnt happen to me
Cuz I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean
She really turned me out
Her body was so tight
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style
And I can't figure it out but

I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems shes got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girls got a hold
I'm so
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems shes got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girls got a hold on me

And I think I like it baby
Oh nooo, oh no
Ooh, yeaah, oh my
