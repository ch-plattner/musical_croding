
Craving your body all through the night
Feels like I'm going through withdraws
I wanna hold you
I want you inside of these of these arms
I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you
Cause I need your lovin' tonight

[Hook]

Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

Constantly thinking of things to do
Places where we can make love
I wanna freak you
I'll freak you wherever you want
Placing my kisses all over you
Caressing you so nice and slow
Oh how, I want you
Girl there's something I want you to know

[Hook]

I get so lonely
Thinking about you
You are the only
Girl I dream of or think of at all
I'm so into you
Outta my mind for you
Say you can't go a day without me
Girl I love and I need you, I need you

Do you get lonely
Thinking about you
You are the only
Girl I dream of or think of at all

Outta my mind for you
Girl I can't go one day  without needing you
I just need to hold you U know that


[Hook]
