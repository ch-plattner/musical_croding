
Love, such a lonely place
Nobody wants to be alone
To have the world but no one to share it with

I'm so alone
I can't stand this feeling of being without you
Yes I'll do 
Whatever it takes to prove I trully love you
Don't let me go
Let's stay together, forever and ever
Can't sleep without you by my side, help me
