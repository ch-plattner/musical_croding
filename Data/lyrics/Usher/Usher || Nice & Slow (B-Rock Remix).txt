Usher Raymond
B-rock, remix
Twista, the first age
Yeah
So come on playa get your lick when its warm
Pull up in front of your crib now
Peep the shine on the chrome
Step out into the breeze and knees up to the back
And you got it now
Let's bump and grind till we moan
Look Shaheed ain't trying to hurt you
Slowly I got to work you
I just want to make you feel real good
Let the words rise stiff
Bumping feels good
Swaying with the smooth beat
On my candy coated cane

[Usher (Twista)]
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top cruisin' the streets (yeah come on)
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing
That's waiting for me (yeah what?)
I pull up anticipating good love (break it down)
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places I've never seen
Girl you know what I mean (yeah)

[1 - Usher (Twista)]
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
Where there ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Nice and slow baby, nice and slow baby)

See I been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up
Baby, I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Nice and slow baby, nice and slow baby)

[Twista]
Ready? Now you gotta do me nice and slow
And have you roll on the go
I promise not to be a pest
And kiss ya places another love would've never thought to go
I didn't lose my mind
So I won't be bogus notice how I move to the South
Check this groove cause I'm down
Got you moving and swaying
When we finish we can take a cruise through the town
While my Usher cd is on, check it out

[Usher]
Now, here we are driving around town (uh)
Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down (yeah)
Girl, you got me saying my, my, my
I wish that I could pull over
And get this thing started right now (yeah)
I wanna do something freaky to you, babe (they hear ya)
I don't think they heard me
I, I wanna do something freaky to you, babe (yeah)
So call out my name
They call me U-S-H-E-R R-A-Y-M-O-N-D
Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me
Gotta nigga feenin' like Jodeci
Every time that you role with me, holding me
Trying to get control of me
Nice and slowly, you know, never lettin' go
Never messin' up the flow

[Twista]

[Usher]
Now tell me
Do you wanna get freaky?
Cuz I'll freak you right I will
