
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

It's not the way that I feel
Cause I'm really in love with you (ahh yeah)
You stole my heart then you ran away
What am I to say, I love you anyway (oh baby)

My love for you will never change
Cause I still feel the same way
The love I have for you will never grow old (oh no)

[Chorus]
My life had changed because of you
And I need you right here with me
There's no substitute for you
As far as I can see
You're the one for me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Every night and day
Thinking of you by my side
Here with me is where you ought to be

[Chorus]
