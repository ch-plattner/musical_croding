You're in total control and you're running the show
I'll do whatever you tell me baby

Baby I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night (forever and ever we'll make love into the night)

Your wish is my command so I'll cancel my plans tonight (yeah)

Who can handle your body right
And I'ma show you tonight (ooh wee baby I'm coming)

Baby I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night (forever and ever we'll make love into the night)

If you ever wanna know (if you ever wanna know)
Who I love (who I love)

You're the one I love and girl ask who I love
Cos that's you (that's you), that's you (that's you)
Yes you (yes you), yeah you

Baby I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night (forever and ever we'll make love into the night)

Bout how I got you all coming when I call
You know I break you off
And if these walls could talk they would tell everybody
Bout how I put it down
You know I shut you down
Got you up off the ground, yes I can't be wasted
And if I let you on my spaceship
You'll have to let me taste it
Hop on it I'ma give you a ride
Cos we gonna make love all through the night
