
Sometimes I rock...
Sometimes I roll
Sometimes it’s not me in control
Sometimes I gotta jump
Before I know what’s below
Sometimes I gotta drop everything and go
Some days we’re hot
Some days we’re cold
Some days we’re carrying a heavy load
Some days I’m digging in
And the love may not show
But I want you to know
You can rely on me
You can rely on me
Yes you can
You can rely on me
For anything
You can rely 
You can rely on me.
And when your life is hinging on regret
Like you made up your mind and you second-guessed it
There’s so much you wanna try 
That you haven't tried yet
I’ve got your back through all of it
Yes I do
You can rely on me
Yes you can
You can rely on me
To understand you
You can rely on me
For anything
You can rely
You can rely on me
It’s you who brought me back when I was lost
Everything I learned you taught me
How to wise up and pay a little more attention
You showed me how to listen
So listen...
You can rely on me
Yes you can
You can rely on me
You can rely on me
Yes you can
You can rely on me
For anything
You can rely 
You can rely on me
