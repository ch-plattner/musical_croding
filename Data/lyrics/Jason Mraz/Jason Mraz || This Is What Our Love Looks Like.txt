
I live every moment to say
How much I love this day
There are no obstacles in our way
No mountains to climb
Everything that I look at is a blessing
Carrying us to build our very strengths
There's no accidents there's only what is
Go on and ask me then who I am 

I have come to be the one to stand beside you when the sun decides to bow its head
I've come to be your friend
I'll share with you my secrets til there's nothing left to hide 
And when you feel the darkness I'll remind you of the light you have inside
This is what our love looks like

There isn't one part of me
That doesn't love one part of you
I'll never knock the things that you do
If I did you would stop my being so rude
I know you will and so...

I have come to be the one to stand beside you when the sun decides to bow its head
I've come to be your friend
I'll share with you my water so your well is never dry 
And when you're feeling empty I'll remind you of the life you have inside
This is what our love looks like

I let every moment say 
How much I love this day
No "buts" about it
It don't matter if it's cloudy

I have come to be the one to stand beside you when the sun decides to bow its head
I've come to be your friend
I'll share with you my secrets til there's nothing left to hide 
And when you feel the darkness I'll remind you of the light you have inside
This is what our love looks like

I'll be the one to stand beside you should your money run out til its end
I'll always be your friend
I'll share with you my water so your well is never dry
And when you're feeling empty I'll remind you of the life you have inside
This is what our love looks like
