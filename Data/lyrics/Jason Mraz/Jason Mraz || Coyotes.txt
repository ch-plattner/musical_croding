Sipping coffee at a quarter to two
I wake up and I'm dallin and my minds running to you
No wonder I'm a one woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar on the nightstand
I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite then a foot in a door,
There's no one else I would rather go out with, that's hell when I see them standing there
Me and my mouth we don't mean to be rushing
We talk about deep freely Cause we crushing
I want to shake both sides of the butt ya
Theoretically, yes, ain't we lucky?

And when the coyotes they sing at the park
It's when the city life starts falling for the sea
Winding roads are winding down and the flying man'll hit the ground
Every motion is closer to touching
the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin.

Coming back for more,
You know I'm coming for you
You know we should be should be together
'cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today not tomorrow.
You better lock your doors
You know why, cause we want you
'cause we like you a lot

I wish the world was alive like you.
I wish the world would help me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You've got a double-sided lexicon
I got to try to keep your attention
Gotta write using less emoticons
Gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dawn
I wanna play in the park come on, now
Let me see your other upper echelon

And when the coyotes escape to new york
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls all fall to the lost and found
The flying man'll hit the ground
Every motion is closer to touching
The coyotes sing when they feast on your lovin'

I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your lovin'

We're coming back for more,
You know I'm coming for you
You know we should be; we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't want to stop
Not today or tomorrow.

Not today or tomorrow, oh no

Because once we rock, we won't want to stop
Not today or tomorrow.
