
Well I heard that it might be raining bed sheets and lover's words
Let's throw out the hotel comforter and hang the 'do not disturb'
Sign me up for the storm
I'll wear my suit for the shower
Cause I'll have you to keep me warm in the coldest hour

And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be
And crazy is the forecast all week

Well every kiss, every hug is so light on that touch, delicate like a snowflake
Well I can taste, I can taste, I can taste, I can taste you all over my face
And everyone might find it foolish to not be counting on the sun
But your mouth is my umbrella now
Because I'm holding your tongue

And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be
And crazy is the forecast all week

There's a good chance in hell
Like cats and dogs we'll be flying
And I'm no weatherman
But you are lightning, striking

Here comes that sun
Want rain
All at once
How it sing

In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud
And await for the warning of another come down
Because the water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks
My well holds plenty for penny wishin' in your deep end
And when the lights go out, no doubt, with you I'll be

And crazy is the forecast all week

And if them rains should fall for sure with you I'll be
Ah because crazy is the forecast all week long
Crazy is the forecast
