
I picture something is beautiful
It’s full of life and it is all blue
I’ve seen the sunset on the beach, yeah
It makes me feel calm, when I’m calm

I feel good
When I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings

[Chorus:]
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing

I see birds fly across the sky, yeah
And everyone’s heart flies together
Food is frying and people smiling
Like there is no other way...

To feel good (good)
and when I feel good I sing (sing)
And the joy it brings makes me feel good (good)
And when I feel good I sing (sing)
And the joy it brings

[Chorus:]
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing

[Interlude]

I feel good
And when I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings

It brings me freedom (freedom), woah,
got to get yourself to that freedom
It's freedom
Singing freedom (freedom) woah,
you deserve your freedom
It’s a smile you can keep in your heart
Freedom, woah,
Everybody got to know freedom
Love to feel in it beauty
Freedom, woah,
got to get to someone,
Got to get to someone,
Got to get to someone,
Got to get to someone freedom
Freedom, woah,
everybody know freedom
It's freedom, come on, try to sing
Freedom, woah, everybody got to know freedom
Break it down

Get you [x7] that freedom

[Chorus:]
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
