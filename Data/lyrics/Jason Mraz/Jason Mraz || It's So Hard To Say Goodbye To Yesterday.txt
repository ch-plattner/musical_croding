
How do I say good bye to what we had,
The good times that made us laugh outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever but forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road is going to lead
All I know is where we've been and what we have been through
If we get to see tomorrow, I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
