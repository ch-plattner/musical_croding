Every time I go home
There's another cell phone tower 
Construction getting louder 
Paving over yesterdays

You and I
We will try to find the side that's pretty 
While our town becomes a city
We won't let it be erased

Empires rise, empires fall 
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and
Watch the world spin madly 'round this life, we're in 
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with

Every once in a while
You know I get these real bad headaches
Worried about the mistakes
I’ve made along the way

Well you and I we can’t hide
From the fact that we need each other
How else will I recover?
When the fever comes again

Temperatures rise, temperatures fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and
Watch the world spin madly 'round this life, we're in 
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with

There are no words, no words
When I’m with you, you

Every time I hear music
They’re adding more shit to it
Things are always moving
To a futuristic place

Well you and I, we can try
We can try and dance until tomorrow
Well time will have to borrow
Not a minute’s left to waste 

Heart beats rise, heart beats fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and
Watch the world spin madly 'round this life, we're in 
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you, I'm with
