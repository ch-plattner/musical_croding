
Tell me a secret, tell me anything
What's your weapon? what's your middle name?
What do you believe in? what's your animal?
Are you a cat or a dog person?
What's your outlook? what's your favourite saying?

Hey, maybe you laugh, maybe you laugh a lot
Maybe you started, but you somehow quit the part mm
And you may be a hippie and a democrat,
Yeah I remember that, I think
And you might like wine, but you're not the type who likes to drink

What made me forget everything i know?
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo
On invisible mics, winding to my mind
So I would like another look inside you,
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I've never known you

Yeah, maybe you're sleeping on a telephone.
And maybe you're dreaming of an anglophone with a crooked smile
And maybe your profile, posts a brand new nose
And maybe your new job, it requires that you cannot wear any clothes.

What made me forget everything I know?
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo
On invisible mics, winding to my mind
So I would like another look inside you,
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I've never known you

Maybe your favourite colour is brown,
And maybe your crying and you're not sure why
Maybe you're living in a whole new town
And maybe you're back with your old boyfriend and you're busy going down.

What made me forget everything,
All my beliefs, are my memories
All the episodes of you, especially the ones that hurt
And the few that made me laugh
Well I can't get them back,
That's why I'm asking for some more of you now
Yes I would love the chance to love you
And I would love to love you!

What made me forget everything I know?
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo
On invisible mics, winding to my mind
So I would like another look inside you,
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I've never known you

I would, I would, I would love to look inside of you
