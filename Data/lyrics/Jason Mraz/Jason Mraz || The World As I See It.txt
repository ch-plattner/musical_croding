
The world as I see it, is a remarkable place
A beautiful house in a forest, of stars in outer space
From a birds eye view, I can see it has a well-rounded personality
From a birds eye view, I can see we are family

It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, it’s not a difficult thing
It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me

Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
Every man makes a difference and every mother’s child is a saint
From a birds eye view I can see, we are spiraling down in gravity
From a birds eye view I can see, you are just like me

It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, it’s not a difficult thing
It’s not hard for me to love you
Oh I really love you unconditionally
No, it’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, it’s not a difficult thing
It’s not hard for me to love you
Oh I really love you,
Love you are the world to me

You are the mountain, you are the rock
You are the cord and you’re the spark
You are the eagle, you are the lark
You are the world and you’re remarkable
You’re the ocean eating the shore
You are the calm inside the storm
You’re every emotion, you can endure
You are the world and the world is yours.

It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, it’s not a difficult thing
No, it’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you unconditionally
No, it’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, it’s not a difficult thing.
It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you, because you are the world to me
No, it’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it’s not a difficult thing (No, it’s not a difficult thing)
It’s not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you (really it’s not hard),
Because you are the world to me.
Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
