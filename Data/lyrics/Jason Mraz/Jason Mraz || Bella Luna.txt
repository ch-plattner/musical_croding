
Mystery the moon
A hole in the sky
A supernatural nightlight
So full but often wry
A pair of eyes a closing one
A chosen child of golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars to farthest reaches of the beach
And far beyond into the swimming sea of stars

The cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellations
No riffs and oh no reservation
If they should fall you'd get a wish or dedication

May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising
Oh, before we lose the lighting

Oh Bella Bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh Bella do what you do

You are an illuminating anchor of leagues to infinite in number
For crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger

You're dancing naked there for me you expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger
Of a girl
Look, I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring ya is a language of a lover

Bella Luna
Mmy beautiful, beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other

May I suggest you get the best of your wish
May I insist at no contest for little you or smaller I
A larger chance set but all them are lie
On the rise, on the brink of our lives

Bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh, Bella do what you do
Bella luna
My beautiful beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other
