
When we die is it just like sleeping?
Does the light mean that it’s light like a nap?
Will I dream? Will I get to see Jesus?
Or like the Lama will I come right back?

Years go fast,
Live each day like it’s your last,
Need not waste time asking
"Why am I alive?".
Don't hold back

Like the whales with their song,
They sing of the memories of long days gone
So do I sing along,
I’ll remember you

Years go fast, I’m already looking back at this,
Me, I know that I won’t last
'cause when I cry I don’t just cry
I fold in half

You are loved, you are loved,
You are loved, you are loved,
You are loved, you are loved,

If there’s a fear about leaving here
Then the devil you will find
But if love, if love is all there ever was,
There’ll be peace on the other side

Years go fast, live each day like it’s your last,
Me, I'm gonna go out dancing
'cause when I die
I know I’m gonna fly
Into an angel's hands

You are loved, you are loved,
You are loved, you are loved,
You are loved, you are loved,
You are loved
