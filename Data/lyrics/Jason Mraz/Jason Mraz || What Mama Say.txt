Whatever mama say
You best do it
Whatever mama say
You best do it
Whatever mama say
You better listen to your mama

Wash your face, use some soap
Make your bed, fold your clothes
Clean your dishes, chew your food
Don't talk back and don't be rude
Take your shoes off at the door,
Don't track no mud along that floor
Don't forget to take the garbage out
Don't want no excuses anymore

Call your sister, cut the grass
Think you're smart? Not so fast
Take your fingers off the remote control because Mama's watching that
Do the dishes, feed the dog
Put out the cat and praise the Lord
It wouldn't hurt you to go to church any once in awhile, just get going

What mama say is what I'm gonna do
Mama said that I should settle down with a girl like you
I'm gonna work real hard, it's what I wanna do
I'm gonna give you all my lovin' and make you a mama too
Baby, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna make you a mama too

(La la da da da da...)

Whatever mama say
You best do
Whatever mama say
You best do it
Whatever mama say
You better listen to your mama

I won't lean back in my chair
Will not run down the stairs
And in case of emergency I'll wear some fresh underwear
I'll keep it callin' when it's in need of repair
I'm gonna get myself a job but I won't cut my hair

"I beg your pardon?" that's what my mama say
"Boy don't get smart and don't talk to me that way!
Who do you think you are, boy? You better behave"
She said "I gave you life, child, I can take it away!"

What mama say
Is what I'm gonna do
Mama said I should be with a girl like you
I'm gonna work real hard, it's what I wanna do
I'm gonna give you all my lovin' and make you a mama too

Sugar, that's what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna make you a mama too
That's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna make you a mama too

(La la da da da da...)

Whatever mama say
You best do it
Whatever mama say
You best do it
Whatever mama say
You better listen to your mama
