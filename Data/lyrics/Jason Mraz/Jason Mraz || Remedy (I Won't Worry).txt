
well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
well, something on the surface it stings
i see something on the surface
well, it kind of makes me nervous
who says that you deserve this?
and what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease

if you've gots the poison I've gots the remedy

the remedy is the experience.
this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious.
this is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
the rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
well, it all amounts to nothing in the end.

I won't worry my life away.
I won't worry my life away.

well, I heard two men talking on the radio
in a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
well, they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this
the unavoidable kiss,
where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe
dance with me,
'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

the remedy is the experience.
this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious.
this is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
the rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
well, it all amounts to nothing in the end.

I won't worry my life away.
I won't worry my life away.

When I fall in love I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why
Because

the remedy is the experience.
this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious.
this is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
the rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
well, it all amounts to nothing in the end.

I won't worry my life away.
I won't worry my life away.
I won't and I won't and I won't [etc.]
