
Marigolds and bougainvillea
Pressed against the fence
There's might be my opportunity
To finally make some sense

Climbin' towards the sky I gained a better understanding
About the sky in fact the sky starts on the ground here
When I'm reaching up I'm really reaching out the boundaries
And I'm all dialed in.
And we're all connected.

It's a simple life today
No matter what they pay me
Playing is my reward
So take it easy on the world when
She's someone else's girlfriend
Taste her cake and see how she likes you

Climbin' towards the sky I've get the other kind of knowledge
And the world is watching and waiting from the wings
So while I'm singing out I'm really thinking how astounding it is
How we're all dialed in
And we're all connected. 
And we're all connected.
And we're all connected…

This spirit lies in auld lang syne
If you ain't here today you're just digging in icy grave
Bottle some hurt and fill in the dirt
And take them old marigolds away.
Climbin' toward the sky has never been my destination
'cause the only way to stop is by jumpin' off
I don't need this microphone to address the nation
Because we're all dialed in
And we're all connected
We’re all connected
We’re all connected
