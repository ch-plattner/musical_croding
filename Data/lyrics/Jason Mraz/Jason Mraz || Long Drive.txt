
Long drive, long night,
The best night of my life,
With you riding, your hand on my hand.
The thought of arriving kind of feels like dying.
I don't want to go home and be alone.
Could we stay out?
Could you drive a little slower? It don't matter where we're going,
As long as I'm with you. We can take the long way.
Chevy Nova, front seat sofa, getting closer, to you.
Drive a little slower. It don't matter where we're going,
As long as I'm with you. We can take the long way.
Drive a little slower. I'm not ready to go home.
I'd rather stay with you.
We can take the long way out, to the country out of town.
Let's get lost. I don't wanna be found.
Let's get away now, and be careful not to crash.
There's no defrost and we're steaming the glass.
You and the road have a generous shoulder
We can pull over and say we took the long way.
Headlights, strobe lights,
I can see you, but not quite.
I can feel you inside. The timing is just right.
For the moment, I don't want to go home.
Take the long way out.
Take the long way now.
Drive a little slower; don't matter where we're going to go now.
Drive a little slower; don't matter where we're going to go now.
Drive a little slower; not ready to go home.
I'd rather stay with you.
We can take the long way.
Long drive, long night,
The best night of my life.
