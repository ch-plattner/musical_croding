Are you dancing with your partner, or are you pushing them around?
Are you begging for attention, or do you love the one you’ve found?
Are you giving up your Saturdays to waltz all over town?
Or is every day a jolly holiday with whomever you're with now?

You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, everything is really possible, all away
You never really own it anyway, It’ll all fall in place if you just let go

Don’t dress up your children like dolls from your past
Or They’ll run from you madly, they'll never look back
And when they grow older, they’ll do just the same
The world’s a reflection of how children play

Well You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, gonna make empty meaningful
You never really own it anyway, It’ll all fall in place if you just let go

When you’re in the mood, baby
Hear just what your heart has to say
When the world is turning topside and turvy then you better hurry back down
To the bottom of your soul and be loved

Your word is your access, your mouth is your door
Let’s slide down inside there, and see what's in store
In the middle there’s a rhythm picking, it's a freaking hard beat
At the bottom there’s a lot of water keeping your soul deep

You could give it all away, give it all and be unstoppable
All away, everything is really possible, all away
You never really own it anyway, It’ll all fall in place if you just let go

When you’re in the mood, baby
Hear just what your heart has to say
When the world is turning topside and turvy then you better hurry down
To the bottom of your soul
Get down, get it all, and be loved
