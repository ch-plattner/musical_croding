Sweet, okay 
Sweet, she loves, she loves, she loves to love me 
But not always my way 

One's gotta bust a nut just to jism 
The wild boys running away with the rhythm
(the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhytm
Oh a classic misdemeanor)
One's gotta bust a nut just to jism 
The wild boys running away and I'm trippin
(trippin, trippin, trippin, trippin
Trippin, trippin, trippin, trippin) 

Learning all about to control the brother and tried like hard to not blow my cover 
(oh, there she blows) 
I leaning all about to control my brother and tried like hell, tryin so hard 
God damn it's so hard 
I'm crazy now, what'cha doing 
Just the same, and I think I'm right 
Crazy now where are you moving 
And your friendship, it pays for your lonely, lonely night 

This is a conversation with myself 
Said it's a conversation with myself 
Oh it's a calming and often alarming
And always a conscious conversation with 
With only myself 

And it's okay to dance around it, have it your way 
It's okay to laugh about it, oh for goodness sake 
Don't believe in anything that is keeping you away

Blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow your horn
Super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow your flute
Super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow your horn
Super 5, super 4, super 3, super 2, super 1 man

Sweet, roll, roll, roll, repetition 
Sweet, okay, sweet 
She loves, she loves to love me 
But not always my way 
See I'm feeling all sentimental 
And feeling all through my head and over my legs, child, 
I'm feeling all very sexual oh but feeling all by myself instead 

This is a conversation with myself 
Said it's a conversation with myself 
Oh, it's a calming and often alarming 
And always a conscious conversation with myself 

Okay to dance around it, have it your way 
It's okay to laugh about it, oh for goodness sake 
Don't believe in anything that is keeping you away 
Loverboy, lovergirl 
You need a song to sleep to and morning to sleep through 
And have it your way 
Oh no, oh say don't don't don't mind
Said have it your way with yourself and only yourself
You better have it your way at anytime
You better have it you way and with yourself and it's only yourself 
You better have it yours and betcha know, betcha know I'll have mine.

Said you better have it, you better have it your way 
You better have it, you better have it your way 
Said you better have it, you better have it your way 
Said you better have it 
Because one's gotta bust a nut just to jism 
The wild boy's running away with the rhythm 
Because one's gotta bust a nut just to jism 
The wild boys sing, the wild boy's running away
He's gotta bust a nut just to jism
The wild boy's running away and I'm trippin
The wild boys say the wild boy's running away

Super blow your horn
Super blow out loud
Super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow your own horn
Super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow your horn
Love, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, love
Love, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, super blow, love
Super 5, super 4, super 3, super 2, super 1, love
Super 5, super 4, super 3, super 2, super 1, super 1 man

Sweet, roll, roll, roll, repetition 
Sweet, okay 
Sweet, she love, she love, she love, she loves
Sweet
