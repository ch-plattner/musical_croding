Lets see those moves, c'mon!

For the brand new direction on the compass rose
Try following the path of the yellow brick
Cross the zebra track down on Abbey Road
And you be there in just a little bit
It's where the hi-fi's bumping through the free wi-fi
Where the up said it's rock we're stayin' alive
Where I'll be passing out the free high-fives
Like a doctor I'm distributing the medical kind

Come on!
Decide if you want to get
Get yourself inspired
You're invited, whoa
To San Disco Reggaefornia, whoa
You come alive in, whoa
And leave your troubles at the door

You know when our time band is messing with the evil
Inside here see everybody's equal
Everybody's type with everybody's people
Even generators run on biodiesel 
Super green is the way we like it
Yea we like the ladies who ride like nice
Up on their bicycles with ice popsicles 
For five nickels I can get us on the tunnel of love

Romancing is a side effect
Slow dancing here will make you sweat
Raise your hand if you wanna get
Get yourself delighted

You're invited, whoa
To San Disco Reggaefornia, whoa
You're gonna like it, whoa
Leave your troubles at the door, whoa
You come alive in, whoa
In San Disco Reggaefornia fornia forniaâ€¦

Make it one of those days
Can you feel the Party?
With parents gone we'll turn the home
Upside down like a Gravitron
What law we gonna break if they catch us getting naughty?
Turn off the phone with the records on

Dancing makes the people feel united
D-d-d-d-dancing makes the people feel united

So take a good look and try for a moment
If you tried and you like it show the world that you're belonging on it
Only those with open hearts and minds 
Will get a pass on the fast track cash list line
But uh, don't be laughing at whoever's behind 
Because everybody's happy on their own damn time
And everybody's craft be uniquely defined 
Just as everybody's ass be free and divine

There couldn't possibly be a brighter sign
For all to understand and to give a damn
All you gotta do is keep the microphone stuck in your hand
And bring the bucket to the sand

You're invited, whoa
To San Disco Reggaefornia, whoa
You come alive in, whoa
And leave your troubles at the door, whoa
Yea you're invited, whoa
To San Disco Reggaefornia, whoa
You come alive in, whoa
And leave your troubles at the door, whoa
D-d-d-d-dancing makes the people feel united
D-d-d-d-dancing makes the people feel united
D-d-d-d-dancing makes the people feel united
D-d-d-d-dancing makes the people feel united
