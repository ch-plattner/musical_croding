
I’m just a curbside prophet
with my hand in my pocket 
and I’m waiting for my rocket to come 
I’m just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and I’m waiting for my rocket, ya'll

y’see it started way back in nyc
when i stole my first rhyme from the m.i.c. 
at a west end avenue at 63 
the beginning of a leap year, february, ’96 
with a guitar picked up in the mix 
i committed to the licks like a nickel bag of tricks 
well look at me now 
look at me now 
look at me now, now, now, now 

i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket to come 
i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket, ya'll

well you’re never gonna guess 
where i’ve been been been 
and i have no regrets 
that i bet my whole checking account 
because it all amounts to nothing up in the end

well you can only count on the road again
we’ll soon be on the radio dial 
and i been payin close attention to the willie nelson style 
like a band of gypsies on the highway while
i’m one man pushin’ on the california skyline drive 
up the coast I brag and I boast
i ’m pickin up my pace and makin time like space ghost 
raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most 
put my cruise control's on coast 
cuz i'm tourin' around the nation on extended vacation see 
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation 
i say, "i like your style, crazy pound pup! 
you need a ride? [*woof*]
well come on, girl, hop in the truck!" 

i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket to come 
i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket, ya'll
i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket to come on 
i'm just a curbside prophet 
with my hand in my pocket 
and i'm waiting for my rocket, ya'll 

see i'm a down home brother, redneck undercover 
with my guitar here 
i'm ready to play 
and i'm s a sucker for a filly 
got a natural ability I'm geared to freestyle 
look at my flexibility 
dangerous at the mike 
my ghetto hat's cocked right 
the ladies say, "yo, that kid is crazy" 
the backstage betties taking more than they can get 
they say, "what's up with m-r-a-z?" 

hey, hey, something's different in my world today 
well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow 
hey, hey, something's different in my world today 
they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow 
i'm just a curbside prophet 
curbside prophet now 
curbside prophet now 
curbside 
come on, now 
curbside prohet 
waiting for my rocket to come...
