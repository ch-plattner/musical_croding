
You can say that I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular
Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor
Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all
Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt
People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things
Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings
But it's much too soon to leave this easy life
Pass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.

Believe it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box
My stomachs smaller than my eyes
so I went to see the doctor and he said "turn your head and then cough"
I didn't listen to what he said instead I couldn't wait to get off
He said I can have this but I cant have that
That I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because
I ain't the one whose gonna be missing the feast
Just like you ain't the one who seems to be calming the beast

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.

Well if you are what you eat in my case I'll be sweet so come and get some
I'm so over it.

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.
(Get up and get some)
there's too much food on my plate
