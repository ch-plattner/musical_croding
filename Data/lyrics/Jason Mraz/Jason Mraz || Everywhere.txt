
If I wasn't a ghost, I couldn't walk into you
If I wasn't the snow, how could I fall for you?
If I wasn't a songbird, how could I call to you?
If I wasn't a fly on the wall I wouldn't know all about you

I'm everything in everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe in
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere, I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too cause you act just like you need me
Mm, I'm everywhere

If I wasn't the fire, how could you stoke me up inside?
If I wasn't a party, how could you be the life for me?
If I wasn't a camera, how could you be so photogenic, yeah I said it
If I wasn't the hands on the clock, how could you know that the time was right, tonight?

I'm everything in everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe in
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere, I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too cause you act just like you need me

I got an eye like a spy on a satellite checking you out
I'm like a fly with my infinite eyes
I can see with all my senses and I'm coming to get you
I'm invisible, expendable, and I'm your present

I'm everywhere, can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe in
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere, I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too cause you act just like you need me
I'm everywhere, I'm everywhere
I'm everywhere, I'm everywhere
