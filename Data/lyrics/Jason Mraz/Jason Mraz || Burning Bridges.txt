I know exactly how you feel,
You were this close to closing deals
Now everything fell from out your hands,
You were forced to decide on other plans now,
You figured it best to just ignore it,
Otherwise, oh, you're just living for it,
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it,
you'd swear they'd never know you sold your soul to the burning, burning, burning bridges.

You know exactly what I want so
I don't have to be so damn up front
No matter the moment where we decide to make our minds up
I'll know a man who may need a new assignment
to hand in his heart and take his last vacation
attempting to spoil imagination
If anyone ever wonders where he went
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over burning, burning, burning bridges.

burning, burning which is nothing more than the longing for being uninvolved.

oh, desire can cause heart attacks.
and desire.. it won't bring you back
