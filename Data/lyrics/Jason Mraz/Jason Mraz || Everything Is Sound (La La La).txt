
When there is love, I can't wait to talk about it
When things get rough, I like to walk with you
Or when it's night, I like to be the light that's missing
And remind you every minute of the future isn't written
Not yet

When there is love, or when the heart feels heavy
We can lighten it up, if you've had enough
Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up
You know it's up to us to make it all up
So what you making up? I can make it up back
You could be loved no matter what
And know the only time is right now, it's right where... where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from

Singing
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound

Let's sing to be happy, to feel things, to communicate, and be heard
Or sing out to protest, and to project, and to harmonize with birds
Whether it's your birthday or your dying day
It's a celebration too
Rejoice to use your voice and give wings to any of choice
Whatever you're choosing right now, it's right where... where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from

Set your vibration and undulation to the hightest it can go
And trust me, hear me
If it makes you wanna sing
Just sing it

La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah

It's a song that I've forgotten often
It doesn't make me wrong
Cause we all need the darkness, to see the light
In our own eyes, come on, and sing it

La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Laying it down
Everything is sound
La la la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah
We're connected now
La la la la
Let's all sing
Hallelujah
Everything is sound
La la la
Let's all sing
La la la la
Hallelujah
We're connected now
