
I want to, I want to hold you

Every time I go home there's another cellphone tower
Construction getting louder, paving over yesterdays
You and I, we will try to find the side of it that's pretty
While our town becomes a city, we won't let it be erased
Empires rise, empires fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and watch the world spin madly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
You, you, you..

Every once in a while, you know I get these real bad headaches
Worried about the mistakes that I've made along the way
You and I, we can't hide from the fact that we need each other
How else will I recover when the fever comes again

Temperatures rise, temperatures fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and watch the world spin madly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
You, you, you..

There are no words, no words when I'm with you, you, you
Every time I hear music, they've added more stuff to it
Things are always moving into a futuristic place
Where you and I will try, we'll try to dance into tomorrow
But time will have to borrow, not a minute left to waste

Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand and watch the world spin madly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
