
I ohhhhh
I'm dreaming of your face
I can see your beauty
Ten and a half thousand yesterdays.
The way the moon illuminates
All the secrets I've been keeping
And cast them off of my balcony.

Ohh I I I I I 
I hope you notice,
That I, I'm still in love with you
Yes I,
I'm coming over, tonight.
I'm coming over, tonight.
I hope you notice I was never over you.

We hold on to things we said 
It makes it more confusing,
I wont let the past get in my way.
Surrender to the eternality now,
Enjoy the midnight serenade

Oh I I I I I
I hope you notice, 
That I, I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, just to say "good night"
I hope you notice I was never over you
I hope you notice I was never over you.

My mind is crawling, 
But I still hear the music all around me,
You found me.

I I I I 
God I love this,
If ever there was a place that I could stay,
I found it

I I I I I
I hope you notice
My love, 
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, tonight
I'm coming over, just to say "good night".
I hope you notice I was never over you.
I hope you notice I was never over you.
