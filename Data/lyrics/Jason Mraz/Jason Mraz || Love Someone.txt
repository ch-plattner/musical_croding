Love is a funny thing
Whenever I give it, it comes back to me
And it's wonderful to be
Giving with my whole heart
As my heart receives
Your love

Oh, ain't it nice tonight we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you

And love is a funny thing
It's making my blood flow with energy
And it's like an awakened dream
As what I've been wishing for, is happening
And it's right on time

Oh ain't it nice this life, we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
When you love someone

We're gonna give ourselves to love tonight
Lifting up to touch the starlight
And we will savor every second
We suspend together
You and I will
You and I will
You and I will

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you
