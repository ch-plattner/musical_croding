
All bets are off from this point on
Starting now, my interest is gone.
You said I had to be a better friend
But not in a friendly way did you say it
I wont follow demands

It's never too late to start over
I'm givin' these bones a try
Wherever is home the heart is
Be glad to be along for the ride

Its never too late
to save the only life you can save

Already gone checked out and borded
Another airplane with an angel
flyin' shotgun up into space

And already asleep in a magazine
Nose in the fold of a lucid dream
Ready for walking out on the wings

It's never too late to jump out
I'm teaching myself to fly
I'm willing to hit the ground when

When I decide
It's never too late
to save the only life you can save

Though the road is long
Carry on
carry on

Be a phenomenon

Cary on and on

It's never too late to start
You're never too old to try
Wherever is home the heart is
And my hearts inside

It's never too late to save
the only life you can save

It's never too late to save
the only life you can save

Carry on carry on
Carry on carry on

Mmmm be a phenomenon
Carry on and on
