Who's thinking about you now
If you were building a wall
Who would tear it all down and pull you through
Who's thinking about you
Who'd care enough to send you flowers,
That you could call at all hours,
And give your love to
If they haven't, well they will
Baby they all will

Just when you suspect that life couldn't get no harder, something comes alone and makes your dark day darker
The weight of it all falls on you
Who will be the one to listen when it's time to listen
Who will be the one to miss you when you've gone missing
Well, I do
Do I qualify, qualify, 
Qualify, qualify, qualify

I want to be the one to help you ignore Mr. Loneliness peeking his head into your door
I'm hoping you can feel me
I'm hoping you can give me a new chance, chance, yes
I'm hoping that you notice
I'm your last chance

I feel like starting something
I feel like calling off today to be with you
Yeah, I believe we all do something that's familiar like a deja vu, familiar like a deja vu
Yeah, and I know this one cause I've seen the fight and I know it love we're giving it up
Do I qualify, qualify,
Qualify, qualify, qualify

I want to be the one to help you move from Mr. Loneliness living in the kitchen of your home
I'm hoping you can feel me
I'm hoping that I don't run out of breath, breath, yeah

Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you

When you're sleeping, darling when you're next to me
I scan you like a credit card, connecting freckles like I do the stars

Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you
