
When I wake up
And the day begins
Do I hold my breath?
And count to ten?
No, will it be three?
We'll see, We'll see
It depends on which day of the week

That I sing out, sing out loud
I'm just one motherfucker singing proud
Singing glory, glory
Hallelu-jah
And yeah That'll do
That'll do

In the arms of a city
It holds no space for the friendly faces of you and me
Go make a life, not a living
Singing glory, glory, glory
Hallelu
Yeah Hallelu-jah

There's things to know
So I'm told
But the days they keep rollin' on so painfully playin' slow
And no room to grow
But blow by blow

You see, I always get lost somewhere
See, I already forgot
To sing out 
I wanna sing out loud
You should be another motherfucker singing proud

Sing out glory
Remind me of the glory
Hallelu
Ha- Hallelu
That'll do

We should all keep pretending that our dreams are patent pending
You should see some of the scenes that I've seen
And I know love cause I've flown above it
And beyond it, but it's still too long of a wait

That's why I sing out
Sing out loud
We should be ten thousand motherfuckers singing out
Oh, sing out glory
Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory
Hallelu, Hallelu
Ha- Ha- ah Ha- ah ah-le-lu
ooh-ooh

I'll sing my story for you
And you'll sing for me too
And together, we will make it through
They say when you sing, you're praying twice
Don't that sound nice?
So, rise up
Come on and give it a try

To sing out
Just sing out loud
We could be six billion motherfuckers singing proud
Why not sing glory?
Glory, Glory
Hallelu
Ha-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-le-lu
ooh-ooh-ooh
Hallelujah

This is no ordinary world
We need extraordinary glory
Hallelu
Yeah, that'll do
Yeah, that'll do

Sing oh
Sing Hallelu....
