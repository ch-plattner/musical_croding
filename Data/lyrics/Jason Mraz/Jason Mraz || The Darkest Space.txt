
Well I'm not just a song anymore 
I just might be the whole damn score 
I might be reeling in your head while 
You're sleeping in your bed at night
Well I'm not just along anymore 
I finally found what I've been lookin' for
I might be sitting in the passenger's 
Side but not along for the ride
'Cause I have control of a home grown situation
I lay back and then I turn the alarm off and turn out the light
There's goin' to be some quality sleeping 
'Cause quality's keeping the quality up at night
I am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly 

Through the darkest space 
Where I try to catch up to the catch phrase 
To human race I say let the games begin
Under way say in conditions that we play in 
Maybe things are better this way 
May the games begin today awww

Oh well...Cause I'm just above 
The aggravation of love
and I raise to optimistical fortune and toasting it twice
I'm sitting high on an anytime any day night
And I laugh to think I'm crying my eyes out well isn't it nice

[Chorus]

An open space when I finally catch up to the catch phrase
The whole damn world is your toy 
Don't you want some love 
Don't you want things to always stay the same
Don't you want your love to be the same as the last day
