I'm overjoyed and over loved and feeling lucky 
Like a little boy who's hiding under covers
And looking to discover any way to play the part inside his darkened cave
Well the meaning of life it starts at the nightlight
Close your eyes and hope to see mine

Well I've seen a thousand things in one place
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face
Erasing memory I feel as though I've never seen a face before 
Until I saw your eyes smiling back at me thru my tears
I've been counting all these years
Now suddenly the thousand things I've seen were 
Nothing more than dreams of you and me

You and me quietly at a stand still
Fortunately you will kiss me and I'll kiss you back
Fact of the matter of is that I don't know what the latter is
That I always wanted to kiss you but 
I always wanted to run from you
Because I always wanted to miss you 
And that I've always wanted to come for you

So... how do you do?
