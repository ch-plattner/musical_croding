
A little like Gene Wilder now
Coming out of the tower now
In a glass elevator that could take you all the way to the sky
Ain't trying to fool ya now
I got nothing to lose and no how
So be in it with the limitless image of the intimate figure that you're getting is love

All you need is love
Ain't it nice to get out of here
Already out of the atmosphere
Well if the glass ever shattered well it wouldn't really matter it's a love that is lifting us up
All you need is love

We're going up, up, up
Flying away
We're taking the higher route
We're taking the ceiling out
We're going up, we're flying away
Never coming down because we're living it up, living it up, yeah

What happens when your light goes out
No ones there to give you mouth to mouth
Don't let the break down trouble you and claim that a brother need's a hero now
Cause I know, you know, because once you know, you'll always know
It's your own, your own, your own love that gets you where you wanna go

We're going up, we're flying away
Never coming down
Taking the ceiling out
We're going up, we're flying away
We're taking the higher route
That's cause we're living it up, living it up

Knowing it's good
And I don't mean good enough
When it's really love
Well you can just rise above anything it's our destiny

A little like Gene Wilder now
Coming out of the tower now
In a glass elevator that could take you all the way to the sky

We're going up
We're flying away
We're taking the higher route
We're taking the ceiling out
We're going up
We're flying away
Never coming down
Because we're living it up, living it up

All you need is love
Love is all you need
