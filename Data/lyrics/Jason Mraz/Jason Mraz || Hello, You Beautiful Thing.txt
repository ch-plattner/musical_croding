
Fall out of bed and catch a fading star
Fancy, I woke up before my alarm
Rub my mind through my eyes, it's the best I can do
Before it's automatic habit of returning to you
Though I smile when it happens almost as if it was magic
It means there's a God somewhere and He's laughing
And I shuffle my slipper-less toes to the kitchen
Still low to the ground, but high on living

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Waking up, I stretch my body and acknowledge some aches
It must be something I did yesterday
Pour a cup of liquid gold, because my engine's still cold
But in a minute everything's gonna change

'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

And this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
This is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)

Looking out from a cul-de-sac watching the band
Of the Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt
I can see from the depths of my readjusting eyes
A reflection of yes's and that ever-changing sky
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake
I don't need no scenes of violence or pain replayed
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray
But my thoughts are all I got so I try to make 'em brave

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(Hello)

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
