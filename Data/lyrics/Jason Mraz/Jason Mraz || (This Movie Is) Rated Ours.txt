
You could be the song in my silent movie
It's you who put the motion in my picture
It's starting right now
I can hear the projector

Don't let the trailer be better than the movie
I plan on staying till the end
Dim the lights and recite your lines to me
Don't let it be a short film

You could be the star you are brighter than the spotlights
Who wouldn't cast you in the role
You got the part auditioning for my heart
You had me at hello

The orchestra rises up
Please don't let our scenes get cut
This is where we kiss and fall in love

So don't let the trailer be better than the movie
Don't let it have too many twists
You don't need no camera tricks
You have you're own special effects
And that affection keeps me hanging in suspense

quiet on the set, are you ready for your close-up
your a natural on the screen
with your eyes you stop motion
put my life into focus
you're the darling of the critics
but this movie's just for me

the orchestra rises up
please don't let our scenes get cut
this is where we ride off in the sun

the orchestra rises up
this is what I'm dreaming of
let's make everyone believe in love
let's make everyone believe in love

this movie is rated ours
