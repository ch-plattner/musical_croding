
Sometimes I rock, sometimes I roll
Sometimes it’s not me in control
Sometimes I gotta jump before I know what’s below
Sometimes I gotta drop everything and go

Some days we’re hot, some days we’re cold
Some days we’re carrying a heavy load
Some days we're digging in before it, and the love may not show
Oh, but I want you to know

That you can rely on me, yes you can
You can rely on me, to understand you
You can rely on me, for anything
You can rely, you can rely on me

And when your life is hinging on regret
Like you made up your mind and then you second-guessed it
There’s so much you wanna try that you haven't tried yet
Ooh, I’ve got your back through all of it, yes I do

Yeah, you can rely on me, yes you can
You can rely on me, to understand you
You can rely on me, for anything
You can rely, you can rely on me

It’s you who brought me back when I was lost
Everything I learned you taught me
How to wise up and pay a little more attention
You showed me how to listen, so listen

You can rely on me, yes you can

Yeah, you can rely on me, yes you can
You can rely on me, to understand you
You can rely on me, for anything
You can rely, you can rely on me
