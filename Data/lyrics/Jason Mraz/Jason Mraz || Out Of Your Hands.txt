
You went walking away into the sun
How romantic but I knew we were done

Was it something I said, something I did?
It must be over my head,
I didn't quite understand it,
Now it's out of my hands, it's out of my hands

I 'm sorry for the way you was feeling about yourself every day
Baby you needed me to make it, so you could keep on running away

Was it something I said, something I did?
It must be over my head,
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands, it's out of my hands.

When it feels like life has gotten out of control,
When it feels like too much, too much to hold
When it feels like too much to understand
Know, that's out of your hands, out of your hands, out of your hands

Was it something I said, something I did?
It must be over my head,
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands, it's out of my hands.

When it feels like life has gotten out of control,
When it feels like too much, too much to hold
When it feels like too much to understand
Know, that's out of your hands, out of your hands, out of your hands
Know, that's out of your hands, out of your hands, out of your hands
