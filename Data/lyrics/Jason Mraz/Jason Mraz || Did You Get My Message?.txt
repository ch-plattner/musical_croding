
Did you get my message, the one I left
While I was trying to condense everything
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message, you did not guess
'cuz if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest
'stead of beating my breast
Making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

Uh oh, where did it go, must have bopped past your phone
And fallen right outta the window
[Rachel Yamagata:] ooh well, how can I tell?
Shoulda called the operator maybe she know the info
But whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
[Rachel Yamagata:] why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back I'd relax and feel relieved
Before my panic attack

Ahh hooo oooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
[Rachel Yamagata:] Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
So they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] no I didn't hear a word you said
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] no I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Did you get my message that I want to reconnect with you
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] I can hear you say your coming but I don't hear
Why did you get the message love ?
That I want to get back with you
Did you get my message love
That I want to reconnect with you
Why did you get the message love ?
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata and Mraz:] That I want to reconnect with you
