Once upon a time there was a meeting of minds
The sun and the moon made a deal with the sky
One would take the morning and the other the night
Together they would blanket the world with light
But the moon had a shadow, he felt like a liar
The sun was the only one who carried the fire
The sun saw this, she kept on glowing
Bound to the moon, never saying, "you owe me"

She said I'll shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you

I keep a lamp over you, glowing in my heart
To keep from tripping over troublesome thoughts in the dark
We ain't that different, we huddle underneath the same stars
I see who you really are
You're every creature, every man, every woman and child
You're the closest thing I'll ever get to knowing God
Like the sun to the moon, I'll send my love and light
A love like ours, it'll fill the whole sky

I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine, shine, shine on you

Think of the people that you love the most
Send them your light and hope it glows
Say I will shine on you, I will shine on you
No matter the distance, the space, or the time
Love travels in the speed of light
I will shine on you, I will shine on you
I will shine on you, I will shine on you

And if you forget we are the chosen ones
Turn your eyes to the attention of the morning sun
Wherever you go, however you move
The light is gonna shine directly to you
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Let it shine on you (shine on you)
Yes I'm gonna shine on you
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine on you (shine on you)
I will shine, shine, shine on you
