
Well I used to walk along the opposite side of the road
And made others get out of my way
I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the times
But they won't come till I meet them halfway

I'm halfway home and I'm on, on my own
I'm halfway there and I don't care, no I don't mind
I plan to leave here after supper time
That's when traffic is light, all I need is a sign
And I'll be alright. I'll be fine

Well I used to think that I could just sleep and then I would dream
And everything it would just come to me
Until I woke one day without anything to eat
Lying on the opposite side of the street
I'm halfway home and I'm still out, still out on my own

I'm halfway there and I don't care, no I don't mind
Because it ain't my time not to stay or say
Well I can't say, but you can bet that I will, I will play my heart out
I won't lay.

I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the times
But I know I gotta meet them halfway
I'm halfway home I tried running with the flow
I'm halfway there. Ain't it funny how everybody seems to care
I planned to get there around supper time their serving up bread and wine
All I needed was a sign and I guess I'll be alright.

I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'll be alright.
I'll be alright.

It seems to be a running theme about being fine and alright but I don't mind.
Because I'll be fine and alright
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
