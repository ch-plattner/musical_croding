
I would like to hold your hand
As we're shifted through this twisted abandon
I would like to think that you'd know your way
We have dodged the ropes of rain
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play
On the handsome fella with umbrella
Who once saved you your day
And I will ask you to open my door from your side
From the inside after you drive
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer
That's why
I warm the engine compartment up
While I stand here and think it up
But it's a little too early to bury the worries
Til this wish is my command

And I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doubling back now
No doubling back
Doubling back now

Well before I catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all
Let me stop to lock my top
For fear of it falling harder
By the eyes were ears and the arms are
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke
How did it drown our love
Oh love
When it rains it's sure to pour
But when I look in your eyes
I fear I won't see surprise
That I'm not doubling back cause

I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And then I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now

No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now

No doubling back now
No turning around now
No going back now
No
