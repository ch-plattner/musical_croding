It's nice to meet you. 
No, I'm not from outer space
But I'd like to take you, to a higher place,
Where we won't ever have to leave the ground.
Just ask what love would do now.

If it's got you thinking about a change of scenery
Try letting go of what it was or how things ought to be
And ask what love would do now,
Just ask what love would do now.

If you care to join me oh when you shake my hand,
Do not let go and soon you'll understand
What it means to have a friend beside you,
Who's there to remind you that love is what you are right now.

Ask what would love do,
What would love do,
What would love do now.
What would love do now.
What would love do now.

Ask what would love do,
What would love do,
What would love do now.
What would love do now.
What would love do now.

Oh, what would love do now.
Oh, Love would love to love you now.
