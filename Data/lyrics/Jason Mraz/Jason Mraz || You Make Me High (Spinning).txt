
Well I don't know just what I'm here for
I want more than words can describe
I've been deprived, can you believe it?
My whole world, well it's falling apart
Well it falls, still it falls when it falls apart around me

And you pick me back up
Oh, said you pick me back up
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up and you're getting me high

Said you pick me back up
Oh, said you pick me back up
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up and you're getting me high

'cause I'm drinking all of the tears you cry
And I don't wish to know my ending
I just say I wanna know when I begun
I wanna know when I begun
I wanna know where it started from
Where it all started from

Because I feel like I am spinning
I feel like I'm spinning
Well I feel just like I'm spinning, I'm spinning around, oh

I said I feel like I am spinning all around the summer
And the winter comes and another storm
It falls, well it falls, still it falls apart around me

And you're picking me back up
Oh, said you're picking me back up
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up and you're getting me high

My my my, said you're picking me back up
Oh, said you're picking me back up
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up and you're getting me high

I'm drinking all of the tears you cry
Breathing every breath that you sigh
I am, I am breathing all of the tears that you cry
That you cry, all the tears that you cry
Every breath that you sigh
