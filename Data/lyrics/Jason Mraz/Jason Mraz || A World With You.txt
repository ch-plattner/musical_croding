
Let's hit the road and throw out the map
Wherever we go, we won't look back
Cause we're going places and we're going there fast
And let's move to Paris and get ourselves a loft
Let's live in squalor, and spend all cost
Let's throw caution to the wind and start over again

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars will shine
Who knows where we're going
Yeah who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world
The way I see a world with you

Let's hike in the mountains and challenge our will
Let's leap over canyons and get lost in the hills
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars are sure to shine
Who knows where we're going
And who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world
The way I see a world with you

All of our prayers will be answered
The sum of all our failures,
They cannot hurt us now
Let's hoist up our sails
And shove off to China and climb up a wall
Then we'll keep on climbing, looking over it all
Laughing it up, yeah having a ball

Think how many doors we'll open
Just as many stars are gonna shine
Who knows where we're going
And who knows what we'll find
I want to see the world
The way I see a world with you
I want to see the world
The way I see a world with you
