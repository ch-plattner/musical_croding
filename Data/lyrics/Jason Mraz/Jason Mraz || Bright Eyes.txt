
Bright lights, big city 
Was quite extraordinary
The drive was pretty
I was in perfect company
The love of a lifetime
Since we were elementary friends
The one with the bright eyes...

Why can't I be optimistic? 
I tried to find the logic logically
I had a dream and I could not shake it
I was standing up there naked

There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand 
The live keep living; growing older more into a man... 
And I let her grow away from me

Love... love is not pretending
Time... time was meant for mending
Memories into all is satisfactory
Healthy smiles fill the page the day we spent in miles
And I let her drive away from me

The one with the bright eyes 
Laughed her way inside this music box; 
Stored away in the corner of my heart
And I let her get away from me
But I'll never take that day away from me.
