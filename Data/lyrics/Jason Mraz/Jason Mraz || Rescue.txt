She needed friends
Didn't wanna be left alone
It wasn't like her
To have her feelings hurt
Everybody hits the wall
Everybody needs a call

He wasn't lookin for a handout
He didn't want my money neither
Tired of speaking to the wall
Everybody needs a call

I'm coming to your rescue
Coming to your rescue
Like a fireman, I'll be your 9-1-1
Whenever you need to escape
Somehow I'll rescue you
I'm coming to your rescue
No, I'll never let you down
Never let you down
No, I'll never let you
Ever fall down, no

Born in 2002
Too young for the work he do
Too young to have the kind
Of voice that people listen to
Not made for the factory
Not made to be a soldier neither
It's not what he deserves
Everybody should be heard

Rescue
I'm coming to your rescue
Like a fireman, I'll be your 9-1-1
Whenever you need to escape
Somehow I'll rescue you
I'm coming to your rescue
No, I'll never let you down
Never let you down
No, I'll never let you
Ever fall down, no

Life is made for love
One and one is two
People need to be seen
I see you
When you're down on your luck
You know what I will do

I'm coming to your rescue
Coming to your rescue
Like a fireman, I'll be your 9-1-1
Whatever you need to escape from
I'll rescue you
I'm coming to your rescue
No, I'll never let you down
Never let you down
No, I'll never let you
Ever fall down
I will be your rescue
