
Well, you dawned on me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And I'm trying to get back.

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest.
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we are just one big family.
And it's our God-intended right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved.

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait.
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate.
I'm yours.

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer.
My breath fogged up the glass,
And so I drew a new face and laughed.
I guess what I'm a saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait.
I'm sure.

[Repeat in the background until the end:]
There's no need to complicate,
Our time is short.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

No, I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.

No need to complicate,
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

No, please, don't complicate,
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

No, please, don't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
The sky is yours

I won't hesitate...

[Overlapped part until the end:]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, come and dance with me, our love one big family.
It's your God-intended right to be loved, loved, loved, loved.

Well, open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, come and dance with me, our love happy family.
It's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved.

Listen to the music of the moment, come and dance with me, our love peaceful family.
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved.

Open up your mind and see like me...
