Oh yea, summer breeze, all in my mind
No no no no, it's all in my mind
No no no no, it's all in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Oh summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know every, everything's alright

Oh summer, you make me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Oh summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile awaiting in the kitchen
Food cooking on a plate for two
Feel the arms reaching out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Oh summer makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

Oh summer breeze
