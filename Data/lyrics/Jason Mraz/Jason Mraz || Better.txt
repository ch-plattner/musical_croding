It's something like I apologize
It's something I still can't decide
But it only gets better
It only gets better

And I want to say that it's not always easy
But it's simple that way
And I want to stay and play it out
But I still have my doubts
So you say it gets better
It only gets better
Better this way
Better, maybe it's better this way

Beautiful things they never stay, oh, the same way
They pass, oh they pass away, they always change
Who are we is who we are
When the act of love can get us so far
So good I wish you would
Think twice on me
Cuz it only gets better

It only gets better
Better this way
Better, maybe it's better this way
Just give it some time
Just give it some space
Just give it some time, maybe it's better this way
Just give it some time
Just give it some space
Just give it some time, maybe it's better this way

So better
It's better this way
Baby, it's better this way
Just give it some time
Just give it some space
Maybe, yes maybe, yes maybe, yes maybe
It's better, oh, this way
Promise me you'll always be better
Better
