Why don't we try to be responsible
For the other motherfuckers that were searchin for the end of the rainbow
Ask me about the impossible
I tell you that everything is applaudable
For life is a proscenium stage and we are the stars
And the audience that we captivate is already ours

And we're more aren't we
Yes we're more aren't we all we are

So collapse all your plans
Like a map in your hands
Cause it won't take long to burn the motherfucker down

Many disaster unnatural
We have the ability it's remarkable
To cycle through the seasons adapting to the reason the waters low
If we listen to the sign of the times when she calls we'll know

That we're more aren't we
Yes we're more aren't we all we are

So collapse all your plans
Like a map in your hands
Cause it won't take long to spot the motherfucker down
So goodbye to your plans
And hello to a land
Where it won't take long to burn the motherfucker down

Move your feet when you pray child
Are you ready to change the way that you've been living your life up til now
The danger is more than a rain cloud
Will you adhere to the new solution to use less the useless uses of pollution hell yes

So collapse all your plans
Like a map in your hands
Cause it won't be hard to spot the motherfucker down
Say goodbye to your plans
And hello to a land
Where it won't take long to burn the motherfucker down
Say goodbye to your family
And hello to understanding
That it won't take long to burn this mother down
So collapse all your plans
And relax if you can
Cause it won't take long to burn this motherfucker down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
Oh to burn her to the ground
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
No it won't take long to burn this mother down
It won't take long to burn this mother down
