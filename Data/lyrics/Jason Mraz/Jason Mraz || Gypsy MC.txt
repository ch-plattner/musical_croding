
I'd like to give a shout out to all the g-y-ps
And individualize because I am an MC.
I can because I care, cause my family's there
Cause I (cause I what?), cause I (cause I what?)
'cause I appreciate the mentality of music
Saving all my sentences unless of course they're smoothly spoken
Quiet type the kind to watch out for
No man of the clan perpetrating the scam
Sure, I'm the boy with the fallopian voice
Straight from the sleeve of any wizard of choice
I got the reason to be roamin' out the coverage area
Send me the bill if all my lovin is scarin' ya
Dare you to dream the way that I believe
Got the skill to go commando in any fatigues
I got the best damn band in the music scene
I can also flow solo just let it be because, of the love
Oh the self-realization is the if and and but
'cause you gotta know your name before you play-a the game
Keep a level-headed check on your health and stay sane
Address the tack on the track put the needle on the record and prepare for playback say jack,
Could I buy another vowel I need another clue and I could also use a towel
And how, goes the medium tempo
Slaying all the teachers like the class of '84
Well down low you know that my fidelities go
And I would never hurt a fly with my flip-flops on, got control
Even keep a clean toilet bowl
2000 flushes blue and it's still going strong
Do I do what I do for the sake of the song comin' through on the radio
It's for you, this is proof my own story's a spoof
I'll always be a gypsy or forever be aloof
And if you never get to liking me it's okay too
But you've made it this far so pay a toll at the booth and move on

Yeah I got top score on Donkey Kong, move on
Move on
Move-a-move-a move-a move-a-move on

True or false? I can be a sensitive man
With sensible plans for the everyday woman
And I can keep her eating out the palm of my hand
Because the dope that we smoked was grown on my land
The words I burn they don't come from a can
The movie in my mind will be the winner at Cannes
So take your chance, apply for full or part-time romance
Cleverer the better, measure up to whatever
Cause it don't matter how tall, how fat, or how small
The equal opportunity is open to all
The casting call the line forms down the hall
All you need is ID that shows that you're legal
But people with egos, well you better not go
Cause' you know I don't need those
And if there is a problem that I really oughta read
Post it on the web care of R-K-O-P
It's easy like me but a bit less the sleazy
Go heavy on the melody and add a little cheese
And if you can't stand the kitchen, get the hell out the heat
To meet with the geek all you need is a
Heart beat beat beat beat beat beat beat…
And remember that fame, fame is
Nothing more than loving someone
And fortune is nothing more than loving what you do
Is nothing more than loving you

Well, I'm type A positive and just the way I like it
Right away I'm satisfied with my food before I try it
Can't deny it to save my life, I'm never lying
To brave this mic without the same thing twice
Is actually an act to staying up all night
With the mood just right and the purchase of a flight
From the west coast to the northern lights
It's aurora borealis' company that I'm tight with
Despite all the things that you've heard
I'll admit that most is true and I'll be keeping my word
By doing double-duty on a search for new verbs
And I report to work early to deliver the worm
With a back well covered by the buddies of ease
There ain't no way in hell that I could ever catch a disease
And breaking all the codes on the latest machines
Well I will even let you download me for free
I'm free …I'm free
Just remember that fame, fame is
Nothing more than loving someone
And fortune is nothing more than loving what you do
And in the eyes of love
Love will overcome, love will overcome
Will ohh
Will over
Over overcome
It's true
Cause look what you've done
To me, to the gypsy
