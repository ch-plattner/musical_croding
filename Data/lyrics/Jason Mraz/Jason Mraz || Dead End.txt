Well easily with me I show affection,
But it's a creepin' up, a creepin' up on me in another direction

I love, I write, and I die
And I try to ask no questions,
But the weary one is still me,
Do you think its obsession?

The smoke will find you a choker that matches your coat, not fit to be tied
The mirror it makes it all clearer as you stand alone and cant see your behind
Yea
They tried to tell me I could say that nobody could believe this
Well they tried to tell me I could say nobody could achieve this
The way you stayed of, locked away of
Keeping the flame for yourself, 
The way you stayed of, pushin' the blame of, reaping the fame for yourself

Oh well, it's a, it's a, dead end
It's a dead end
Oh, it's a dead end lonely day,
Say it's a dead end
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a dead end day
It's a dead end oh day
And it's a long way, a long way down,
Hey well it's a long way, a long way down

Change is a coming a baby, 
Don't be startled lady
Every once in a while they do it again
You gonna shake it, shake it,
You know you wanna take it
Back to where you once belonged,
Back beneath the sheets and between the pillow cases
And the snake he races out and he, he tangles into your hair
Funny the fruits you choose
Oh the time you take, the words you loose
And it all goes back to rotation over the back of your hand
Oh the back of your hand, oh the back of your hand
Oh the map is your hand, 
It's the back of your hand, the back of your hand
Say the back of your hand, oh the map is your hand, it's the back of your hand

Stop whining all the time,
Don't you find a little secret to yourself always saved your life, 
Stop listening to the words that you've heard
No one else but yourself will agree with you more
That it's a long, long way
It's a long, long way
And it's a long, long way, a long way down
Hey, and it's a long way down, 
And it's a lo- oh- oh- ng way down
Hey, hey, hey, and it's a long, long, long, long way down,
Say say, [SCATS]
And it's a lo- oh- oh- ng way down, hey and it's a long way down
It's a dead end
It's a dead end oh
It's a dead end lonely day
It's a, it's a dead end
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a dead end day
It's a dead end oh day
