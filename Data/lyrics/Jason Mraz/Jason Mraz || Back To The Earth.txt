
Whenever my head starts to hurt
Before it goes from bad to feeling worse
I turn off my phone
I get down low
And put my hands in the dirt

I try to stop the world from moving so fast
Try to get a grip on where I'm at
AND simplify
This dizzy life
And put my feet in the grass

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the earth

The only explanation for a high rise
Must be that everybody wants to get high
And move on up
To a deluxe
Apartment in the sky

Well, the higher we go, the taller we grow
We lose sight of the land below
Well, you can have your place
Up in outer space
'Cause my home is where my food is grown

[2x]
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the earth

(All right lets get the rest in over this bridge)

We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)
We started with the motion
At the bottom of the ocean
Now we're swinging from the tops of the trees

We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)
And to truly be forgiven
We must all get back to living
With the land in harmony

[4x]
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the earth
(Two more times around!)
