Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
He could handle anything; he was my granddad
He grew his own food and he could fix his own car
I watched it all happen in our backyard
He'd reinvent the part to fix the broken home
He'd restore the heart

Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Well if Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well he may laugh at me or he may have a lot to say
Well he might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid and be his protégé
What happened to the ground right where we are?
What happened to the family farm?

Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma said
He would never lose his head

Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Well I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a Garden of Eden
And I would bless our family with the gifts that granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
Baby I'll make that guy be me
