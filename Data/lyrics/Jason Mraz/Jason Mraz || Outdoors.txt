
All day I've been inside
And I've got the feeling
I'm trapped between the walls
And underneath the ceiling

I feel a bit off track
And I'm trying to get back

Back in the cool, cool air where the sun is shining
Nothing's going to stop me
It's all in the timing
It's finally again my turn
It's time to return

'Cause I won't stay inside no more
No more
I can not wait to go 
Outdoors

Well open up your door and be like me
Open up your door and then breathe free
And look at all the beauty you'll feel
Loved, loved, loved, loved

Listen to the music of the wind and the birdies sing
We're just one big family
And all of nature deserves to be 
Loved, loved, loved, loved,
Loved

So, I won't stay inside no more
No more
It can not wait, I'm sure
There's need to run and hide
Let's go explore
It feels so great let's go outdoors

(Don't cha do)

Everyone come on
come on out here 
Where the air is fresh and clear

So, I won't stay inside no more
No more
It can not wait
Let's go outdoors

Well, open up your door and be like me
Open up your door and then breathe free
And look at all the beauty and you'll find 
the earth and the sky is yours

So please go, there's no need, 
there's no need to hide inside
Let's go explore
This will, this will feel so great
Let's go outdoors
