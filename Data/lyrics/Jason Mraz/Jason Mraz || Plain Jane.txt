
So simple hearted and not so remarkable
As an ordinance with the common folk
Expecting nothing from the coming
Of another person's joke

And what you do remains as empty
When it's full of giving life
So that no one sees the deeds you've done
And no ones hears you cry
You make all the fashion statements
Just by dressing up your mind

Stay free, stay the same
Play it straight
And own your name
Plain Jane

You're a hero and you hardly know it
So it goes again
You're the reason that I fell in love
You're the reason that I am
Your belief in being normal means
To wrap around my hand

You are more than just the average girl
You've more to give the world
Yet you keep your secrets to yourself
Till you press them to a pearl
You are everything the every man wants to see
And longs to be

Stay free, stay the same
Play it straight
And own your name
Plain Jane

You're as you are
Your mother made it so
As you are
Your mother made a star
You'll go far

If you stay free, stay the same
Play it straight
And own your name
Plain Jane

Stay free, stay the same
Play it straight
And own your name
Plain Jane
