Yeah livin' on the bottom on the sea
There's plenty of room for you and me
For you I am so deep
At the bottom of the sea is where I be

And from the bottom of the ocean
Up to the water shed
To float your boat is what I'm hoping
And we could share my water bed

And all of the whales
Dedicate their songs to you
Yes I would sail
Away
With you
Yes I would sail
Away
With you

At the bottom where we'll live
The perfect place to raise our kids
They'll go to school with all the fishes
They won't have to wash no dishes

Underwater you will
Like it, like it
The current don't 
Fight it, fight it
Open your eyes
And see that I would
Sail
Away
With you
Yes I would sail
Away
With you

Wishing on a starfish in the sky
I wish I may wish I might
Every day every night
Under the ocean blue
I'd say I do
I'd sail away with you

Underwater you will
Like it, like it
Go on and
Dive in dive in
Open your eyes
And see that I would
Sail
Away
With you
Yes I would sail
Away
With you

There's nothing the whales
Can say
Or do
Yes I would sail
Away
With you

I love you
