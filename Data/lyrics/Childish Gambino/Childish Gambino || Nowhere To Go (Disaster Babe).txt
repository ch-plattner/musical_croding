[Hook x2]
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner

[Hook x2]
