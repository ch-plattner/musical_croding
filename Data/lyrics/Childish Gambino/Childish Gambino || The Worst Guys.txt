[Hook: Childish Gambino & Chance the Rapper]
All she needed was some... [x16]

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
At a Clippers' game on the court-side
Watch a nigga' shoot like a .4-5
They mad at me, too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, some Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there, say som', girl say som'
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'mma ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a menage, and murdered the vaj'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Our neighbors
All alone, no no no no
