Dude with a hoodie and hair in cornrows
With a dick size bigger than niggas in pornos
That satisfy cause they know that I care physically
I walk inside the party and know I'm the man instantly
I hate bars, I can't stand the clubs neither
I'm not dancing I'm fuckin havin a seizure
A lyrical legend lately lot a punks wish they
Got that ice needed for niggas to call them pimps; bull shit
I bite niggas heads off call me alligator
I wear bright clothes like a pack of now and laters
My hood is darth vader, cause that's my light saber
And my golf socks will prolly make your eyes dilated
Pimp juice concentrated, my swagger fresh squeezed
And them haters can't stand it cause they got weak knees
Treat banks like restaurants pass the cheese please
I'm the bees knees I got little kids sayin like:
Get Like me
Get get like me

My flow is retarded, call me rainman
Cause I make it rain man!
My hoodie print bright like a fuckin toucan!
What's the frequency ken?
Kickin it with french girls like the can-can
We can be friends, call me adam
Cause I am the man.
Let me put it like this
Rappin ain't easy, there's only bein weezy and jeezy, kanyeeze
Boys wanna be me, but my swaggers off the heezy
Call me crime mob, I run the big apple like my names Steve Jobs
My shoes custom made, white top bright green
My pants top shelf so I call em' high jeans
My clock is sick like the hospital
So if you somebody bobb'n street I'm probably responsible
If I got some extra dough, I'm bout to buy these kiddies a bunch of ice cream
Not the food, but the shoes so they walkin down the street like
Get like me
Get get like me
