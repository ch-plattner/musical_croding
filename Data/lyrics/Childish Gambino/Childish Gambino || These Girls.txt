
We are really close and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast

These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel
I wanna keep you real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause

These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all

I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

I don't have the heart - fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleepin' in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'

You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losin' everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because

These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all

I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all
