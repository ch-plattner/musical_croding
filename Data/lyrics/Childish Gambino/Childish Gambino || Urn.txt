
I watch them all pass by
The moon & the stars
Let me hold you in my arms, for evermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing, by the side
Let you go, on to the sea, just for me
Don't ever limit my love

Keep holding on
Let the modest go
As my mind goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of them
Cause I won't know
