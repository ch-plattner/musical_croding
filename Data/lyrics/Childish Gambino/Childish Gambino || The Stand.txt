I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
Nigga, this who I am

Good morning!
I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
And I hope that you understand

I be ridin' forever [x8]

Yeah!
Childish Gambino
Hot as Nevada, Reno
Niggas, they say, "what he know? "
Give me five like I'm Tito
I never touched a kilo
Opposite Al Pachino
I keep a Lightsaber like I fuck around with Greedo
It's time to be a grown-up
Nigga get your ownuh
See a nigga rollin'
Riding on diplomas
Damn this beat is so nuts
Thank you, MC DJ
Yeah, my mouth is nasty
Like I gave a BJ
I don't give a fizzuck
If niggas are out of lizzuck
This nigga is off the hizzook
Like walking out a prison
For me, I see a vision
You're fucking with ambition
Casino money like Navajo
Their money says, "Geronimo"
My money comes in lotto dough
Be me on the other tit
Call me Mr. Masturbate
Tighter than your jerkin' grip
You looser than some turkey neck
Haters need to listen up
My attitude's a prostitute who broke
Cause she don't give a fuck

Good morning!
I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
Nigga, this who I am

Good morning!
I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
And I hope that you understand

I be ridin' forever [x8]

OK!
The game is afoot (What?)
The mystery's at hand (OK)
We like to pilfer podiums, in other words we take a stand (Ah, shit)
We make a plan, attack that jam like it was Afghanistan (Charge)
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van (Ruh-Roh)
Stop and listen be shopliftin' 'pocalyptic Stephen King [Maniacal laugh]
I take a stand, fuck the man
Now will you please pull dat string (Pull the string)
I need your case and a dime
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups (whoop whoop)
Takin' a bite out of crime, so all criminals better hold up (Freeze, dirt-bag)
I be ridin' forever
Like a vampire on a bus [Laugh]
Like a roller-coaster tester [Scream]
I be ridin' till I bust
I got my magnifying glass
My bike matches my cup
Watch my seekers eat pedal
You can dine on my dust
Whatever it is we can handle
But we really don't do murder
Fuck up suspects, gather clues
Then we break for a cheeseburger [chomp]
No shit Sherlock, mad like murdock
If there's a mystery goin' on
Be in it like Robin Williams shillin' Good Morning, Vietnam. (Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu...)

Good morning!
I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
Nigga, this who I am

Good morning!
I gotta take a stand
Nigga, this who I be
And I hope that you understand

I be ridin' forever [x8]
