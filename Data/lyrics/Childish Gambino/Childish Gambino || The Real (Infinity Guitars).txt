
Motherfuck a nigga
Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her

Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin' me head
And your bitch can't sleep 'cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line
Hidin' from you bitches 'cause real nigga's hard to find
Work this shit like overtime
Yeah, my clothes are so designed
Closet look like Bloomingdale's, yo closet look like fashion jail
I break you out, I post for bail
This money make me Olsen twins, you call your bitch, you hearin' this
Uh uh uh

Yes it's necessary to be flier than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek

This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man
Comme des Gar√ßons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I'm a act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?
I don't need to talk to you
I am just a rapper too
