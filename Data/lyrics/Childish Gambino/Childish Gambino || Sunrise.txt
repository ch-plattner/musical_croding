[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "hasta luega"
Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego
I'm smoking, I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes it's a concert
To my black nerds this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be
Im bustin', bustin' bustin', bustin' on these niggas man
And nothin, nothing nothin, nothin is the same again
You lookin dumb as hell man for ever sleeepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin on him
Will he fail?
Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, uh

[Hook x2]
Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

[Verse 2]
New shit
You didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt
Thats that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, novacation
Murder versus the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's something that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Can't you hear me baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me baby?
Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?
