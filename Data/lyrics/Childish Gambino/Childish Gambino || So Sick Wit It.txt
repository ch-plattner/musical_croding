[Intro]
Uhh
Yeah! This how we do this
(Sick Boi)
Gonna show y'all how I does
Childish, Gambino
Gambino, on the real
Let's do it

Girl show your wobble off
I'm not Queen Latifah but I (Set It Off)
I'm lookin like a tight rainbow, Kangols, got my blue ruse
Lookin like candy so I'm goody two-shoes
Call me (Spruce Goose) cause my clothes so fly
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy
I'm a (Big Mac), you just a small fry
Tryin so hard to get that swagger like mine
And got them steps off my head, I guess my mind wanders
Try to emulate my (Lifestyle) like condoms
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ
I keep a thick chick on (The Wire) like (Wee-Bey)
He say, she say that I so handsome
And Flay keep away from this girl like Ransom
Sorry that your girl all Europe like Tyler
You know him from the South, I stay dirty like Tyler

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
So sick with it that they call me ebola

My boombox handy, blastin that stank
You can Marcus like Quimby, they call me the Tank
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade
I ate a La-Z-Boy but I'm always gettin laid
I'm jack of all trades, I can do no wrong
I'm make a huge fart and it style like a song
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words
I shit out cavities, you flossin my turds
I don't like ice; a little bit of gold and them Nikes
The Cool Kids understand my plight
I'm a simple Sam - I'm always thick with it
cause that's who I am - I keep that shit slick
like my name was Pam - and even if I did it
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin 'round in a Civic
And for those who didn't get it, you should play it back
I'm sick like a dog on crack, f'real

[Chorus]
