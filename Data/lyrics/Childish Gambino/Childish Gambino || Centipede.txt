[Chorus:]
Oh... aye... oh...
Lost all of our, woe...
We lost all of our woe...
Oh, sad love songs...
Aye - centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 1:]
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy?
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubtin'
That these niggas won't hold me back
Ah, they wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he movin' that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day-to-day
I'm at my grandma's house, man, like "I don't know what to say"
Maybe "I'm sorry", but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back
And I don't know where he at
But tell him he missin' out
His grandson cool as fuck
And tell me who be standin' when them other ones giving up?
Let's keep it spontaneous... I don't need that rehearsal
More flow, man... than Progressive commercials
Get with the program, cause a plus loan ain't puttin' us on
I got month-long before I take the bus home...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn, I wasn't in it
Damn, we wasn't finished
Damn, I got us tickets
Damn, we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea
And my brother still movin', ain't no shit I can tell him
Try and keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wildin'
And it's nice to have a fellah when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm makin' is enemies
Here I'm screamin' obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger than Edenwald Projects
Was eatin' all concept of anyone walkin' out
What is you talkin' 'bout?
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now, but you don't feel better

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
'Cause if not, I'm a failure...
'Cause if not, I'm a failure...
Oh...

[Outro:]
"It's not an unholy nigga, it's a Arab nigga in the store. You know what
He want? Money, nigga. You know what your bitch want, you know why they
Feel they can't fuck with you? Cause you don't have no money, my nigga.
Bitches do not want a nigga with no money. Did you not learn this in
Harlem? Lesson number one. You can't keep saying you a Harlem nigga and
You don't want that skrilla, nigga. Come on B, it's home of the
Hustlers, nigga. That's all you gotta understand. It's the hood nigga.
It's make guap or die, nigga."

"School him."

"What do you think? Cause he gotta know, my nigga. Money is not evil,
Nigga. Go tell them niggas in Polo you don't wanna make no money, nigga.
What they gon' say, "Oh, he right"? Hell no, nigga. You think niggas
Like selling crack and shit nigga? You think niggas like putting crack
In they ass nigga, and selling cracks out they ass? You think niggas
Like shooting niggas, my nigga? You think niggas like tucking packs? You
Think niggas like baggin up? You know how boring baggin' is, my nigga?
It's so boring, my nigga. There is no underground, Joe Budden is on his
Fourth mixtape selling shit. The underground is hot. There is no
Underground nigga. You don't see Raekwon or none of these niggas on the
Block. There's no more block, nigga, it's over for the block. You ask
Any nigga on the block, do they wanna be on the block? They gon' say no,
Nigga. Get your money, man. Stop tryin' to be gooned out.

"Hood niggas don't want to be-"

"Hood niggas don't want to be hood niggas, my nigga. Everything niggas
Do, everything niggas do in the hood is for money, my nigga. What's one
Thing that niggas do in the hood that isn't for money? What bitch would
Want a nigga with no money? Huh? Huh?! Yo, slime! It's your time."
