[Hook: MC Chris]
I am the awesome, you see me flossin
Watch me walk, upon ,your face
Make that incision, I leave you itchin
just to join, my mon-ster race
Say I'm just messin, yeah well I'm pissed
that I can't keep, an e-ven key
You think you know me, but you can blow me
cause you don't, know how, I feel

[Childish Gambino]
It's Childish Gambino ho - what you know about that?
Niggaz 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats
Cause if they see me, they might have to act right
I'm livin life right, like I got a past life
Boy I got a flashlight, check my fuckin hoodie skin
Like God was makin light and threw my hoodie in
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym
Call me Elroy, nigga we some hooligans
And just in case I keep a million in the glove box
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock
Ice cold, bright colors like a juice pop
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin showin up
Boy it's me, TNT, boy I'm blowin up
Nigga throw it up, noy I am the awesome
Call me Elroy or Mr. Hey-How-Much-It-Cost-Him

[Chorus]

[MC Chris]
Okay!!! Rackin 'em, stackin 'em, packin these parlors
Gettin these, beatin these hoes like Carver
Whittle like cardboard, steady like barbers
I'm back and forth from the front to the starboard
Back up Marlin, it's only a suit
Like high torch cause he ain't get the boot
Like fly gossip, birds in the zoo
Cause the underground sound I'm reiteratin through
Once I'm in the mad loop, what a real man do
With a cannibalistic crew, when they runnin on the loose
Can't handle the truth, like a fart to a scoop
Put my hand on the mic and my mind on the loot
Crime to duke, ridin away
I'm a dick snub that you bothered to say
I get krunk then the car pull away
Now don't get sick got the shit on spray, okay?

[Chorus]
