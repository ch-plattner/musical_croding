[Verse 1:]
Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass Appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
These girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin', Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
This beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the Fockers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
You fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
My dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper man, you coulda fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me

[Verse 2:]
I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah I like the white girls, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though, so it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are their Asian girls here? Minority Report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the cheque, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm Dominant, niggas call me faggot cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' outta the backside of a rocket ship
It's Monster shit, you dude's are the opposite of Lochnesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say that like a white kid
Yes you're booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed and I meant honeys, oh forget it
I have worked all Winter, I will not fail Summer
In the back of the bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let's me pollenate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second, man we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry have this sandwich, got my wallet, Cheese and Lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everythin'
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin', runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled, Freaks and Geeks
