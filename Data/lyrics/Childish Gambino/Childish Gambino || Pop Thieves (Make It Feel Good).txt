Now that we have found this love, baby
I can't explain my feel, oh
Now that we have found this love, baby
I've never felt this real, oh
Loving you is all I know, baby
You make me feel so high, oh no
I just wanna feel your love, baby
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no

[Pre-Chorus:]
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whatever you like, make it feel good

[Chorus:]
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far
I know you miss this di-love
Let's go somewhere far away, baby
Where we don't need no phone, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never feel alone, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

All my friends are telling me, oh
You need to slow it down, yeah
But I'm so tired of wasting all this time
I need your love right now
Give it to me right now, oh yeah
All that I want now, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
All that I want now, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
All that I want now, yeah
Oh, give it to me now
Give it to me now, oh
Oh yeah, give it to me right

Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good

[Jaden Smith:]
I used to walk on the beach at night. I remember. The best time was when, well, me and you, we got all our friends and we got a tent. We slept in it. Not the whole night, but just enough time. Magic happened, nothing was born luckily. It's up to me, but then we left. The times have changed. The pleasures that I feel. They say you never say never, it's real. Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep. I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep. I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room. Under the moon, romance. Hold on, brother
