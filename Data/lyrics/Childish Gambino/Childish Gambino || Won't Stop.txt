We are so far away from here

[Childish Gambino]
Tell them "Run it back", this song is my shit
Told that DJ, "Turn it up", all we did was bowflex
It's that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boy no shit about it
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy we fresh to death
They be sleeping when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to keep y'all hyped, that's that turnip green
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fall, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, though may pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin' over this nervous shit?

[Hook: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

[Childish Gambino]
Burn burn burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?
Burn burn burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?

All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?

Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?

I should have known
