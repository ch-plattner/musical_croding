I am so different being me is like the lottery

I am so on like the tv when you fall asleep

Niggers making Pottery, 
But I broke the bowl now my shit has got em dancing like a baby ?oaken pull?

yes I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
and these hoes are acting different cause I'm Rich Comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them guinness's
I gotta drink my medicine, to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck you know I gotta give a fuck

You know I gotta give a fuck

My face is broken out

My shirt is hand me down

This kid named Vincent want to take my shirt and lay me out

I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flier now that witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new cloths, 
were the potion

cause I never felt that good in my own skin
its probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
and when I meet another black kid, they tell me I'm a fool

cause I wear these tight cloths,
tight jeans,
tight shirts
Yeah I stay tight, 
like these girls that make my dick hurt

Yeah I'm self concious, 
go ahead laugh it up, 
cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
they told my ass to blacken up

what the fuck are you

you don't even say shit 
quit writing gay shit

now when they see me, have to squint like asians

cause I'm to bright like an old night light
when I do not talk I am being po-lite

rap all night

act all day

momma so scared Ima waste away

I don't have time to sleep, 
I don't have time to eat
these niggas got time to do everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerking to a mirror

I am just a rapper, 
can't make it clearer

to every kid in a world full of pain

please give a listen to this song and my name

Childish Gambino, We are all children

I am just a murderer, Man I just killed this
