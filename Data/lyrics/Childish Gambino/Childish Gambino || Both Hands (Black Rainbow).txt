[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
These guys aren't tough-n-stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But, the chips are down, because I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes, and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me because I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, Crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a Cow Pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'm a ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands

[Musical Intermission: St. Vincent]
"Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bed alight and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder"

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
This is all fun, yeah, my work is Vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free downloading
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie, black chick, double stuffed Oreo
Make I shit rapped pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, I can change your prospective
Sick boy, click. That's an Animal Collective
Fuckin' with your world, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in such a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah, my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tail, I've earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight till that rec spin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Every nigga have and hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'm a change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird Souffl√© and the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shot gun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause the used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga mother fucker turn your eyes on
I am so different, you don't even know the half of
I do not talk, mother fucker I'm a Rapper!
