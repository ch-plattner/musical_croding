Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Nobody really wants ya.

[Verse 1:]
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine.
So, I probably used the b word a couple times.
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine.
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign.
When we were making out, you kinda act like it was nothin'.
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or somethin'.
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends.
You fucked me in that different way. I guess it all depends.
Texting on my day off. "Hey babe, what's going on?
Sorry I can't make it out." Sad face, emoticon.
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on.
I told you, I'm a soldier, need a girl scout to tag along.
Face down, ass up. That's the way you left me.
I thought there was a sparkle. We were missing Lisa Leslie.
"You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me! "
I'm always fucking childish. You knew that when you met me.

[Chorus:]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Nobody really wants ya.

[Verse 2:]
You ain't that fine bitch, what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks. I guess I'll never learn.
I hate it when you think you're really getting something good.
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should.
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em.
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about 'em.
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate.
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous.
I know you're probably texting these lyrics to your friends
Saying, "this nigga think he all that, he fucking sucked in bed."
Well, uh... I think we both know that I worked that ass.
I hope your dude can keep it stretched... yoga class.
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference,
But you'll probably know it's you after the first sentence.
So, let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis.
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it.

[Chorus: x2]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.
Nobody really wants ya.

Nobody really wants ya...
Nobody really wants ya...
Nobody really wants ya.
Wants ya [echoes out]
