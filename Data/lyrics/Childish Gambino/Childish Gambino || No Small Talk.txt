[DJ Drama:]
As time goes on (Hello? Hello?)
Your talk keeps gettin' smaller (Hello? Hello?)
As Childish lives in his short shorts (Hello? Hello?)
He's got no time for your short money (Hello? Hello?)

Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like "Damn, I'm so handsome"
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist (wrist) got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

[Chorus - Kari Faux:]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (I'm takin', I'm takin', I'm takin')
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (I'm takin', I'm takin', I'm takin')
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)

[Kari Faux:]
Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (swish)
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans (lil woadie!)
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi (skrrt!)

[Chorus - first 1/2]

Young 'Bino, we be mobbin', you don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice, leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys, oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug (whoo!) - that's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss, you 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge, goddamn, you dirty bitch
You were lettin' me bust in it but if they ask I plead the fifth

[Kari Faux:]
Okay this the part where I need y'all to make it bounce like Spalding (yeah)
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a, new nigga and he
And he, and he, and he say he from New Orleans

[Chorus]
