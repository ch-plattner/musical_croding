[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Who the fuck, Gambino, this nigga on your tivo?
My hotel cost a kilo, I’m banking like a free throw
Fuck y’all, we A-Team, y’all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way, Hublots, gold chains
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she see me tomorrow
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees
Unnecessary roughness? We just trying to function
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don’t wife ‘em like Khalifa, we just party then we leave ‘em
Tell ‘em that we hittin’, we don’t really see ‘em
My girl look best when she only wear it fitted
Q and ‘Bino in the house and you niggas in the senate
Get it?

[Hook]
Four thou’ on my fit, that’s unnecessary
Skiing in Japan, that’s unnecessary
Molly on my rider, that’s unnecessary
‘Bino spit the fire, that ain’t even necessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
Roll out on a plane, that’s unnecessary
Tussin and champagne, nigga that ain’t even necessary

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
They say don’t buy the belt and I got it
They say don’t get the Rollie and I bought it
Nigga, I’m balling
My mixtape can get you through college
Getting them dollars
Showing my pearly white teeth, nigga that’s flawless
Came a long way from jumping out of Impalas
Same gun and press different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock
Yock, yock - rappers better move ‘fore the nigga get dropped
Mr. fly boy, you got your label hot
I’m the hardest out, you’s a table cloth
Unnecessary balling, I was carded off
Been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can’t stand it
Hundred racks for three months, man this shit is outstanding
See now I got her stupid racks, billion, trillion
That’s what I call building
‘Bino what it do, let’s go half on a million

[Hook]
Bathroom DVR, that’s unnecessary
I’m pushing in that bulletproof, that’s unnecessary
Stuntin’ at the mall, that’s unnecessary
Condo on my arm, that ain’t even unnecessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
Pisa for a day, that’s unnecessary
Shows a hundred K, that ain’t even necessary
