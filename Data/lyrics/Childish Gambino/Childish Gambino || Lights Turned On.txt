[Verse 1:]
Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud, let me backtrack
I know my game ain't that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can't have
So I don't text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn't last year
Oh, you like me now, well that's weird
Last year you were chillin' with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you ma, Raichu
Fuck ya life
I don't really think I drank enough tonight
Lookin' at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame-ass dudes gon' suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin' to me
"Nah, baby, you way too hood for me"
Y'all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I'm on the edge, they hopin' that I might fall
I make it work, I'm runnin' with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain't used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an '06, I'm an '02
But enough about high school
I'm gettin' laid, or I'm gettin' lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say somethin' dumb to give us somethin' to fight about?
Never mind, lights out

[Hook:]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin'
Show me what you do to me, me

[Verse 2:]
Swag
2: 30 and we still makin' progress
Talkin' on Twitter to see where to go next
3: 30, man, where did the time go?
I'm chillin' with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I musta left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doin' stupid shit, have stories when I'm older
But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That's why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talkin' 'bout the girls in my songs?
If you don't like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, 'cause he punk
She like, "I'm not a slut, " speed bump
By the way, what's your name?, 'cause we drunk

[Hook:]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (we druuuunk)
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose (we druuuuuuunk)
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin' (I'm drunk)
Show me what you do to me, me

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin'
Show me what you do to me, me

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (I got to get high)
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose (I need to get high)
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin' (I got to get high)
Show me what you do to me, me (I got to get high)

[Outro:]
I gots to get high
I need to get high
Uh, I needs to get high
Uh, I gots to get high
