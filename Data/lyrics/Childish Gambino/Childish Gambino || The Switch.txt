Eh eh eh Childish Gambino, ho

Sippin' on that Knob Creek, royalty is my peak
Got a nigga eatin' out yo pussy when your mom's asleep
Drinkin' mango lassi, can't nobody stop me
Give your boy a track and leave the body like Gadhafi
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
Ain't nobody fuckin' like it's HIV, man
It's crazy how Memorial Drive is just that
Only liquor stores and porn survivin' the cutback, but hold up
Hold up, hold up, man my neighbor just shot himself
Bullet to the head and exit out the bottom left
I never holla back, bitches and all of that
I got my work until she comes and forms a dollar stack
When you counting the Ninja Turtles while these white guys get fraternal?
You ain't want no problems, we be on that B&B
The only nigga slinging 30 rocks - legally
Throw the verses on the track but ain't nobody seein' me?
I can't see, shout out to my nigga Ellison
It's been a year since I said "Too expensive"
The post office won't give my dad his pension
Your girls get mad when I pull out like extensions
Pete's still goin', Chi's still blowin'
My girl Polynesian you can say I got Samoan
It's a marriage - it's apparent that this is it
In a year I went from Will Farrell to Will Smith
And my turds terrified cause I killed this shit
