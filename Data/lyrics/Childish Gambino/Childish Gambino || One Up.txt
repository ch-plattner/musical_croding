[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party 'til the sun up
You ain't liking what we doing – shut up
You ain't liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 1: Steve G. Lover]
Fuck the recession, I'ma keep this thing going
If you ain't know 'em, bet you probably still work for 'em
Chick from Bermuda, that's right I get my work foreign
They don't get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em
Niggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for 'em
Niggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for 'em
OG status, my job's got perks for 'em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain't ever gotta search for 'em
You know what I'm doing, nigga I'ma do things
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I'm Usain
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I'ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I'm looking like the new king
All I do is win so who the hell's losing

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles
But really it's time to get up, smoking on that get up
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up
I'm feeling like a winner, my living be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Ukemi
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other niggas lame
These niggas used to hate me, I guess ain't nothing changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don't know where we going
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It's that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me
But now we killing paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me

[Hook (x2)]
