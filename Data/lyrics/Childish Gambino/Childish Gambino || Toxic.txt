[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Flow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner
I take her round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G. I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney, in '03 ya know me
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C

[Hook]
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like perogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you horrible like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[Hook (x2)]
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
