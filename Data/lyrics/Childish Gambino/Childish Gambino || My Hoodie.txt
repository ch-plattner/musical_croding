My names Bambino, I'm always in trouble
I do studpid shit on a dare like double
Thinking your games tight, I'm gonna bust your bubble
I shop at Gucci and Barneys like rubble
Scope like Hubble, quick like tunnel
I leave MC's in the dark light tunnel
Men do huddles, girlfriends cuddle
Eh heh, alright

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow

My hoodie is so dope, my hoodie is so tight
My hoodie is in school cause my hoodie is so bright
Welcome my nigga to the color crayola
Got the birght purple, like a grape soda
Nigga I told you, my hoodie no joker
Walk up in the hoodie to a party like toga
Breathe like yoga, Get off my scrotum
The color of my hoodie like a Lisa Frank folder
I'm at the kid robot, my wallet done sho nuf
They had five hoodies but this shit done sold out
Spent too much, I know a bad habit
My hoodie looks like a shit from a tricks rabbit

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow

Ya'll know I'm a hoodie all pro
Find me in my hoodie like a hoodie waldo
Rocking Amadeus like a hoodie falco
Staying self absorbed like I'm Frida Kahlo
From the playground, with the sports team on it
To the old folks home, put some morphine on it
I rock my hoodie whether it's rain or shine
Over-priced, in a Sam Goody frame of mind
Got a pouch in the front that holds my CDs
And warms my hands when it's too breezy
Believe me, the quickest way to get hurt
Is if I catch you calling it a hooded sweatshirt

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
