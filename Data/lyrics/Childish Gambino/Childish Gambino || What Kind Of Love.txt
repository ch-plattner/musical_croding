
What kind of love just stays the same
What kind of love don't die alone
What kind of love would take this long
What kind of love don't make you old
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna play you something
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna tell you something
Cause you satisfy my heart
Even though we'll fall apart
Can't remember how to start
Little lies
You like to call me koala
I'll be your simba, you're nala
Wherever you go I'll follow
Little lies

Drove for hours just to see your face
Sorry
Drove for hours just to see your face
We should've talked if just to clear the space
But now we stare at each other
Buryin' whatever feeling that was
He texts to keep your heart D-stacks
Keep your heart
These girls are smart D-stacks
These girls are smart
I don't know
Why get a dog, it's just gonna die
Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day
And that's just real shit he can still spit
But what's the point
I said a lot of stupid stuff
I think that I was growin' up

What kind of love don't hurt so bad
What kind of love don't feel this way
What kind of love would make me fold

Little lies [6x]

Na na na na na na na na

Little lie
