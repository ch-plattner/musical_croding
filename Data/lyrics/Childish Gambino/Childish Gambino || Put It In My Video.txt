Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video

Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Verse 1:]
I'm blowin' up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls who turned me down are saying "please" and "sorry"
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "sm"
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay
Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say
I ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out

[Verse 2:]
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
And I'll all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth
I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about

[Hook]
