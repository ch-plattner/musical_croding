[Hook:]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up

Young God what it is, how you livin' huh
Young thing and she sayin' let me beat it up
See me out in my ride wanna key it up
He got a Kia, I got a Bimmer
She got a Fiat, half Italian
She wanna ride up, on my stallion
See me stylin', I'mma ride out
Hit Lihue then we drive to the hide out
That's the way that we living
He fly her out every weekend
Because her thinking is different
She dance around in the kitchen
Like "do do do dun do do"
You'll always be my baby
Ask me what we're doing
Yeah you know that drive me crazy
I actually wanna ride with the top way down
When I get her home I'mma lay that down
Lay that down
Oh oh

[Hook x2]

In the year 3005
And the world I love is gone
Do you know where we're headed?
I seen ya
I know love
I see everything
I know everything
I can do anything
I just wanna sing
I just wanna dance, now
I'm so free you know, know
I can't help myself, no
Oh my god, oh my god

[Hook x2]
