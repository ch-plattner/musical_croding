Uh uh
Yeah we gon' get it
Yeah
Uh uh
Oh no no no

[Hook:]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly
I'm just being me
Moved up, weed
In my girl clutch
White girls so
The twelve ain't never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
Need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down
Then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's alot of us
Talk shit
But nobody else ontop of us
Got popular
This the real shit
Get [?] in the face
With a full clip
Get [?] in the aim
Niggas don't slip
Then get [?]
With the case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas
I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains
When really they livin'
We got abroad
This is world war three
I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down
I'mma steal that crown
I'mma do that thing
Girl you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident
With hair like Django
How we walk in the room
And the girls they notice
'Cus they know you bogus
I'm the man you noticed
And...

[Hook]

I'mma show you how to do this
It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the gold coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

We can go together
It doesn't really matter
[Cough]
Oh
Yeah
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
Are we done?
