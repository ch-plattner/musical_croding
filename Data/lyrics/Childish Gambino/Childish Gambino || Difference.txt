[Verse 1:]
Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rapping shit's my Tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say hay like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy, vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
Facebook messages asking how I did it
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try to go hard

[Hook:]
I am just different

[Verse 2:]
I am so different, the games on lid eye
Listen to my mixtape, change your all shit up
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones
Haters say I'm changing, but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I ruined all their favorite songs
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate
Hatin on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape
Black Clark Kent, all I needs a Lois Lane
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane
Voice mail, E-mail, sending text message
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast
Believe me you don't want this, I am all about business
Life is a bitch, I must be dating her sisters
Got to be different, take chances like pictures
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches
I'm not at the top, but y'all niggas know I'm comin' fast
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one
Springsteen this city cause this city we were born to run

[Hook:]
I am just different
