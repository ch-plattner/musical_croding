
Okay what's up my nigga
Word up to seven figures
My swag is always capital, it live in north Virgina
Bino on a hood beat, ain't know he had it in him
I came on this beat, I ain't even buy it dinner
Slide inside the party late, leaving with the baddest ho
Whiskey shots and doin Asian bitches is the status quo
The future's always coming, whether clitoral or vaginal
I'm always in that pussy like my jacket made of calico
It's on, I made this shit for New Years
Play this shit at midnight, like TV shows with boobies
My asthma status chronic, you can get an ounce of that
Real G's only, don't fuck up my alphabet
I'm as real as I'm a get, loser who got confident
Attracted to an awkward bitch, but mostly cause we're opposites
Blew up in 0-10 like tick, tick boom
No drugs at the club, I'm a slip shit through
Came hard on this bitch, my dick did too
Here's a list of the shit I'm addicted to
Like, weed, whiskey, sometimes ex
But that is only when I'm drunk and call her up to have sex
These girls I fuckin now see my dick as a blank check
So I only sign my name and dot my 'I's on her chest, Yes
What y'all really want What ya'll really want, now
Black guy on Mad Men. I'm telling ya'll it's goin down
Ring around the Ros'e, these bitches love to fall down
Sober girls, broke niggas, tell em that they not allowed
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on
It's on, it's on, let me tell you how it's on
Who the fuck you think this bitch is leaving with?
Cause one of us is famous like 'She and Him'
Wasn't cool in high school, but that's expected with geniuses
My music goes hard, bang shit like gay penises
My DJ be Sosupersam
She Asian, fuck that Klu Klux Klan
I love these clothes, that's who I am My name means fashion, Gucci mane
We are not exclusive, I hope she understand me
Chris Brown pussy, it won't make it to the Grammys
Finally met your girlfriend, that is why her knees hurt
Been to hell and back and all I got's this fuckin T-shirt
Laughing while mackin these ho
Vastly these rappers are slow
Asking to get back in the know
Cause they lacking a passionate flow
Trust in Gambino, he has never failed us
Cause I have got "S" plus what a dog's tail does
I read your blogs, fuck that fag
I'm like, LOL, hash tag rap
DC be spittin Jigga
He white, but he my nigga
My shit be grown man
Your shit be kitty litter
I always do it bigger
