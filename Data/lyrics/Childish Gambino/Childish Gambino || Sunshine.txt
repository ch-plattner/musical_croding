[Childish Gambino]
Baby I'm livin the dream
With you by my side, we work as a team
I know I'm a mack, it's not what it seems
I'm covered in pink, from swimmin in green
When I'm eating you, like Edi Amin
Mama the stars could not intervene
You are a star, I'm keepin it clean
You are the prettiest girl I have seen
What does that mean? It means you're the one
And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun
Girl you know that I would never do that to you
All of the girls that I do must be beautiful
Inside and out, meaning your mouth
Girl I'm just playin, this is what I'm sayin
If you like real, then give me a go
If you never try, then he'll never know

[Chorus]
Ooh it's alright, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And if the sun don't come out, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh

[Childish Gambino]
Look, I'm the man y'know
I'm the one to give you mo'
Ma, you got that stupid flow
I talk about moms like Margaret Cho
And I'ma go, minus the "O"
So I'm a G, sportin a V-
Neck and a check, on my shoes
Cause I got nothin to lose uhhh!
I'm in it to win it
Money so long I get business from Guinness
Diving in green, I'm swimmin in spinach
And I'm in the race, who cares about finish?
I got an advantage, and I'm an advantage
I'm what you need girl, you need an advantage
And nothin is heinous so I can work for ya
Couldn't stand out, girl

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
