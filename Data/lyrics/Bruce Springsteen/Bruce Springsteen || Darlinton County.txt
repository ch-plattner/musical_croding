
Driving in to Darlington County 
Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July 
Driving in to Darlington County 
Looking for some work on the county line 
We drove down from New York City 
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name 
Driving in to Darlington City 
Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's 
We drove 800 miles without seeing a cop 
We got rock and roll music blasting off the T-top, singing... 

[CHORUS]
Sha la la, sha la la la la 
Sha la la la, la la la 
Sha la la, sha la la la la 
Sha la la la, la la la 

Hey little girl, standing on the corner 
Today's your lucky day for sure, all right 
Me and my buddy, we're from New York City 
We got $200, we want to rock all night 
Girl, you're looking at two big spenders 
Why, the world don't know what me and Wayne might do 
Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers 
For a kiss and a smile, I'll give mine all to you 
Come on baby, take a seat on my fender 
It's a long night, and tell me, what else were you gonna do? 
Just me and you, we could... 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Little girl, sitting in the window 
Ain't seen my buddy in seven days 
County man tells me the same thing 
He don't work and he don't get paid 
Little girl, you're so young and pretty 
Walk with me and you can have your way 
And we'll leave this Darlington City 
For a ride down that Dixie Highway 

Driving out of Darlington County 
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the Lord 
Driving out of Darlington County 
Seen Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford 

[REPEAT CHORUS 3 TIMES]
