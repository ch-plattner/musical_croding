
When the night's quiet and you don't care anymore, 
And your eyes are tired and there's someone at your door 
And you realize you wanna let go 
And the weak lies and the cold walls you embrace 
Eat at your insides and leave you face to face with 
Streets of fire 

I'm wandering, a loser down these tracks 
I'm dying, but girl I can't go back 
'Cause in the darkness I hear somebody call my name 
And when you realize how they tricked you this time 
And it's all lies but I'm strung out on the wire 
In these streets of fire 

I live now, only with strangers 
I talk to only strangers 
I walk with angels that have no place 
Streets of fire
