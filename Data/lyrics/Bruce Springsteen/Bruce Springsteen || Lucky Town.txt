
House got too crowded clothes got too tight 
And I don't know just where I'm going tonight 
Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain 
There's somebody callin' my secret name 

I'm going down to Lucky Town 
Going down to Lucky Town 
I wanna lose these blues I've found 
Down in Lucky Town 
Down in Lucky Town 

Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots 
But that coat always had a thread hangin' to loose 
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise 
It led me right past your house and on over the rise 

I'm going down to Lucky Town 
Down to Lucky Town 
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found 
Down in Lucky Town 
Down in Lucky Town 

I had some victory that was just failure in deceit 
Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet 
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane 
Tonight I'm sleepin' lightly and feelin' no pain 

Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health 
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves 
When it comes to luck you make your own 
Tonight I got to dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home 

Down in Lucky Town 
Down in Lucky Town 
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found 
Down in Lucky Town
