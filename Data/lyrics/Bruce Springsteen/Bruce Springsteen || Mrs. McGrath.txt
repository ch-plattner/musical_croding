"Would you like to make a soldier 
Out of your son, Ted? 
With a scarlet cloak and a fine cocked hat, 
Mrs. McGraw wouldn't you like that?" 

Mrs. McGraw lived on the seashore 
For the space of seven long years or more 
'Till she saw big ship sailing in the bay 
"Hallelu, babbelu, I think it's he!" 

"Oh, Captain dear, where have you been. 
Have you been out sailin' on the Mediteren'. 
Have you any tidings of my son Ted. 
Is the poor boy livin' or is he dead?" 

Now up comes Ted without any legs 
And in their place there were two wooden pegs 
She kissed him a dozen times or two 
Saying "Holly molly could it be you?" 

"Now was you drunk or was you blind 
When you left your two fine legs behind? 
Or was it out walking upon the sea 
That tore your legs from the knees away?" 

"No I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind 
When I left my two fine legs behind. 
For a cannon ball on the fifth of May 
Took my two fine legs from the knees away." 

"Now Teddy me boy," the old widow cried 
"Your two fine legs was your mama's pride 
Them stumps of a tree won't do at all 
Why didn't you run from the big cannon ball?" 

"Now against all war, I do profrain 
Between Don Juan and the King of Spain 
And, by herrons, I'll make 'em rue the time"
