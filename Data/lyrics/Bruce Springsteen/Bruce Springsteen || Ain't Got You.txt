
I got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold 
I got all the bonds baby that the bank could hold 
I got houses 'cross the country honey end to end 
And everybody buddy wants to be my friend 
Well I got all the riches baby any man ever knew 
But the only thing I ain't got honey I ain't got you 

I got a house full of Rembrandt and priceless art 
And all the little girls they wanna tear me apart 
When I walk down the street people stop and stare 
Well you'd think I might be thrilled but baby I don't care 
'Cause I got more good luck honey than old King Farouk 
But the olny thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you 

I got a big diamond watch sittin' on my wrist 
I try to tempt you baby but you just resist 
I made a deal with de devil babe I won't deny 
Until I got you in my arms I can't be satisfied 

I got a pound of caviar sitting home on ice 
I got a fancy foreign car that rides like paradise 
I got a hundred pretty women knockin' down my door 
And folks wanna kiss me I ain't even seen before 
I been around the world and all across the seven seas 
Been paid a king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally 
But I'm still the biggest fool honey this world ever knew 
'Cause the olny thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you
