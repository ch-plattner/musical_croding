A one, two, three, four!

Well look out mama, your little girl she has changed
She cut her baby curls and she's got her act rearranged
Well look out daddy, what she needs now she can't find at home
Oh Ricky wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Ricky wants a man of her own

Mama says her little girl won't talk to her anymore
She just goes in her room, turns on the radio, and shuts the door
She's got her own bathroom, TV, stereo, extension phone
Oh but mama, Ricky wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Ricky wants a man of her own

Well daddy says when he drops her off Friday night at the gym
She slides way down in the front seat so the kids won't see her with him
She don't do no work, she won't tell nobody when she's coming home
She makes poor daddy wait down on the corner at midnight all alone

She used to like me to take her to a ball game or a movie show
She used to make daddy take his little girl where she wanna go
Now we're left peeking through the curtains every time that we hear a horn blow
Well I guess Ricky wants a man of her own

Well my folks say, "Son, talk to her, she'll listen to you"
Yeah she listens real nice and she does what she wants to do
Daddy says she wears her jeans so tight, "Well you change 'em or you're stayin' home"
Oh but daddy, Ricky wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Ricky wants a man of her own
She's almost grown
Ricky wants a man of her
She wants a man of her
Ricky wants a man of her own

Whoa!
