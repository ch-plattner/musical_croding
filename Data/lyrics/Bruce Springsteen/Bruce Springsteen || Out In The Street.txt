
Put on your best dress baby 
And darlin', fix your hair up right 
Cause there's a party, honey 
Way down beneath the neon lights 
All day you've been working that hard line 
Now tonight you're gonna have a good time 

I work five days a week girl 
Loading crates down on the dock 
I take my hard earned money 
And meet my girl down on the block 
And Monday when the foreman calls time 
I've already got Friday on my mind 

When that whistle blows 
Girl, I'm down the street 
I'm home, I'm out of my work clothes 
When I'm out in the street 
I walk the way I wanna walk 
When I'm out in the street 
I talk the way I wanna talk 
When I'm out in the street 
When I'm out in the street 

When I'm out in the street, girl 
Well, I never feel alone 
When I'm out in the street, girl 
In the crowd I feel at home 
The black and whites they cruise by 
And they watch us from the corner of their eye 

But there ain't no doubt, girl, down here 
We ain't gonna take what they're handing out 
When I'm out in the street 
I walk the way I wanna walk 
When I'm out in the street 
I talk the way I wanna talk 
Baby, out in the street I don't feel sad or blue 
Baby, out in the street I'll be waiting for you 

When the whistle blows 
Girl, I'm down the street 
I'm home, I'm out of my work clothes 
When I'm out in the street 
I walk the way I wanna walk 
When I'm out in the street 
I talk the way I wanna talk 

When I'm out in the street 
Pretty girls, they're all passing by 
When I'm out in the street 
From the corner, we give them the eye 

Baby, out in the street I just feel all right 
Meet me out in the street, little girl, tonight 
Meet me out in the street 
Meet me out in the street
