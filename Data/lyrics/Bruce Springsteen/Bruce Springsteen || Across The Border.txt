
Tonight my bag is packed 
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks 
That will lead me across the border 

Tomorrow my love and I 
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies 
Somewhere across the border 

We'll leave behind my dear 
The pain and sadness we found here 
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water 

Where the sky grows gray and wide 
We'll meet on the other side 
There across the border 

For you I'll build a house 
High upon a grassy hill 
Somewhere across the border 

Where pain and memory 
Pain and memory have been stilled 
There across the border 

And sweet blossoms fill the air 
Pastures of gold and green 
Roll down into cool clear waters 

And in your arms 'neath open skies 
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes 
There across the border 

Tonight we'll sing the songs 
I'll dream of you my coraz√≥n 
And tomorrow my heart will be strong 

And may the saints' blessing and grace 
Carry me safely into your arms 
There across the border 

For what are we 
Without hope in our hearts 
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters 

And eat the fruit from the vine 
I know love and fortune will be mine 
Somewhere across the border
