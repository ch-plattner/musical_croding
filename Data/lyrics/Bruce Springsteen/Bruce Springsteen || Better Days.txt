Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening 
To the hours and minutes tickin' away 
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin 
While it was all just slippin' away 
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come 
Or that train to come roarin' 'round the bend 
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose 
And a woman I can call my friend 

These are better days baby 
Yeah there's better days shining through 
These are better days baby 
Better days with a girl like you 

Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss 
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt 
It's sad funny ending to find yourself pretending 
A rich man in a poor man's shirt 
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon 
Your heart like a diamond shone 
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms 
Out of these hard luck bones 

These are better days baby 
These are better days it's true 
These are better days 
There's better days shining through 

Now a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure 
Don't make much for tragedy 
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin 
And can't stand the company 
Every fool's got a reason for feelin' sorry for himself 
And turning his heart to stone 
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell 
And I feel like I'm comin' home 

These are better days baby 
There's better days shining through 
These are better days 
Better days with a girl like you 

These are better days baby 
These are better days it's true 
These are better days 
Better days are shining through
