
Well every night I see a light shine in your window
And every night you won't answer when I come knocking at your door
Your daddy won't ever let me in 
And I see from the street your silhouette sittin' close to him
What must I do
What does it take
To get you to

Yes and late at night I see the two of you softly swayin'
