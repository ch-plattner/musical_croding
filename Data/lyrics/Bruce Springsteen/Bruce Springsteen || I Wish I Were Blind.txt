
I love to see the cottonwood blossom 
In the early spring 
I love to see the message of love 
That the bluebird brings 
But when I see you walkin' with him 
Down along the strand 
I wish I were blind 
When I see you with your man 

I love to see your hair shining 
In the long summer's light 
I love to watch the stars fill the sky 
On a summer night 
The music plays you take his hand 
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance 
And I wish I were blind 
When I see you with your man 

We struggle here but all our love's in vain 
Oh these eyes that once filled me with your beauty 
Now fill me with pain 
And the light that once entered here 
Is banished from me 
And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees 

And though this world is filled 
With the grace and beauty of God's hand 
Oh I wish I were blind 
When I see you with your man
