I know what it's like to have failed baby
With the whole world lookin' on
I know what it's like to have soared
And come crashin' like a drunk on a bar room floor

Now you got no reason to trust me
My confidence is a little rusty
But if you don't feel like bein' alone
Baby I could walk you all the way home

Well now our old fears and failures
Baby they do linger
Like the shadow of that ring
That was on your finger
Those days they've come and gone
Baby I could walk you all the way home

Love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor
We go on, as is our sad nature
Now it's some old Stones' song the band is trashin'
If you feel like dancin', baby I'm askin'

It's comin' on closing time
Bartender he's ringin' last call
These days I don't stand on pride
And I ain't afraid to take a fall
So if you're seein' what you like
Maybe your first choice, he's gone
Well that's all right
Baby I could walk you all the way home
Baby I could walk you all the way home
