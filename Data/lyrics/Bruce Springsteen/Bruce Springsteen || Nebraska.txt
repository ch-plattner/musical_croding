I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton 
Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died 

From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap 
Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path 

I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done 
At least for a little while sir me and her we had us some fun 

The jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death 
Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest 

Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back 
You make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap 

They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my soul'd be hurled 
They wanted to know why I did what I did 
Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world.
