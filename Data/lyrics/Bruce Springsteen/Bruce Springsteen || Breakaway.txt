Had a meeting on the docks with a light blue Monterrey
To breakaway

Sonny was playing all his cards last night
In a hotel room he dealt his life away
To breakaway

Now the promises and the lies they demand it
Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay
To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray
To breakaway

Janie slipped from behind the bar last night
Cashed out and walked onto streets rainy and grey
To breakaway

Janie slid into a car last night (sha la la la, sha la la la)
In a parking lot she gave her soul away (sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la)
To breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)

Now the promises and the lies they demand it
Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay
To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray
To breakaway

Bobby lay 'neath a sheet of stars last night
His back on blacktop still warm from the heat of the day
From breakaway

Bobby went down hard last night (sha la la la, sha la la la)
Saw a shooting star as the evening light slipped away (sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la)
From breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)

Now the promises and the lies they demand it
Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay
To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray
From breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)
Oh breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)
To breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)
To breakaway (sha la la la, sha la la la)
To breakaway (sha la la la)
