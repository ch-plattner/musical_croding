
My little sister's in the front seat with an ice cream cone 
My ma's in the backseat sittin' all alone 
As my pa steers her slow out of the lot for a test drive down Michigan Avenue 

Now my ma she fingers her wedding band 
And watches the salesman stare at my old man's hands 
He's tellin' us all 'bout the break he'd give us if he could but he just can't 
Well if I could I swear I know just what I'd do 

Now mister the day the lottery I win I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again 

Now the neighbors come from near and far 
As we pull up in our brand new used car 
I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry and tell 'em all they can kiss our asses goodbye 

My dad he sweats the same job from mornin' to mornn 
Me I walk home on the same dirty streets where I was born 
Up the block I can hear my little sister in the front seat blowin' that horn 
The sounds echo'in all down Michigan Avenue 

Now mister the day my number comes in I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again
