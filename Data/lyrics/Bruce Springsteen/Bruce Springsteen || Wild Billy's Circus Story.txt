The machinist climbs his Ferris wheel like a braid
And the fire-eater's lyin' in a pool of sweat, victim of the heat wave 
Behind the tent, the hired hand tightens his legs on the sword swallower's blade 
Circus town's on the shortwave 

Well, the runway lies ahead like a great false dawn 
Fat lady, big mama, Missy Bimbo sits in her chair and yawns 
And the man-beast lies in his cage sniffin' popcorn 
And the midget licks his fingers and suffers Missy Bimbo's scorn 
Circus town's been born 

And a press roll drummer go, ballerina to-and-fro, cartwheelin' up on that tightrope 
With a cannon blast, lightnin' flash, movin' fast through the tent, Mars-bent 
He's gonna miss his fall, oh, God save the human cannonball 
And the flyin' Zambinis watch Margarita do her neck twist 
And the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along: 95, 96, 97 

A ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds 
And the highway's haunted by the carnival sounds 
They dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind 
A man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin 
Runnin' home to some small Ohio town 
Jesus, send some sweet women to save all your clowns 

And Circus Boy dances like a monkey on barbed wire 
And the barker romances with a junkie, she's got a flat tire 
And now the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire 
Circus town's on the live wire 

And the strong man Samson lifts the midget, little Tiny Tim, up on his shoulders, way up 
And carries him on down the midway, past the kids, past the sailors, to his dimly lit trailer 
And the Ferris wheel turns and turns like it ain't ever gonna stop 
And the circus boss leans over and whispers into the little boy's ear 
"Hey, son, you want to try the big top? 
All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop"
