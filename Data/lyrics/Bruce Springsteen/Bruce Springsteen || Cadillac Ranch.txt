
Well, there she sits buddy justa gleaming in the sun 
There to greet a working man when his day is done 
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt 
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch 

Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts 
Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth 
Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back 
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac 

Cadillac, Cadillac 
Long and dark, shiny and black 
Open up your engines let 'em roar 
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur 

James Dean in that Mercury '49 
Junior Johnson runnin' thru the woods of Caroline 
Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans-Am 
All gonna meet down at the Cadillac Ranch 

Cadillac, Cadillac 
Long and dark, shiny and black 
Open up them engines let 'em roar 
Tearing up the highway just a big old dinosaur 

Hey, little girlie in the blue jeans so tight 
Drivin' alone through the Wisconsin night 
You're my last love baby you're my last chance 
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac Ranch 

Cadillac, Cadillac 
Long and dark, shiny and black 
Pulled up to my house today 
Came and took my little girl away
