Janey had a baby it wasn't any sin 
They were set to marry on a summer day 
Bobby got scared and he ran away 
Jane moved in with her ma out on Shawnee Lake 
She sighed Ma sometimes my whole life feels like one big mistake 
She settled in in a back room time passed on 
Later that winter a son come along 

Spare parts 
And broken hearts 
Keep the world turnin' around 

Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night 
But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights 
Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch 
Bobby heard 'bout his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back 

Spare parts 
And broken hearts 
Keep the world turnin' around 

Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton 
Put her baby in the river left the river roll on 
She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay 
Got down on her knees cried till she prayed 
Mist was on the water low run the tide 
Janey held her son down at the riverside 
Waist deep in the water how bright the sun shone 
She lifted him in her arms and carried him home 
As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything 
Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring 
Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash 
Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good cold cash
