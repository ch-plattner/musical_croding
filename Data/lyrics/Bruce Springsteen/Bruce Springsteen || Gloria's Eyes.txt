I was your big man I was your prince charming 
King on a white horse hey now look how far I've fallen 
I tried to trick you yeah but baby you got wise 
You cut me cut me right right down to size 
Now I'm just a fool in Gloria's eyes 

Swore I'd get you back I was so sure 
I'd get you back life I done so many times before 
A little sweet talk to cover over all of the lies 
You came runnin' back but to my surprise 
Well there was somethin' gone in Gloria's eyes 

Well in the dark when it was just me and you 
I asked the question that I knew the answer to 
Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf 
Tell me is that a smile 
Or is it somethin' else ? 

Now I work hard to prove my love is true 
Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you 
At night I pray as silently you lie 
Some day my love again will rise 
Like a shining torch in Gloria's eyes 

I was your big man I was your prince charming 
King on a white horse now look how far I've fallen
