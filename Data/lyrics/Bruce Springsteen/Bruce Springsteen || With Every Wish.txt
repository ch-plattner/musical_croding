Ol' catfish in the lake we called him Big Jim 
When I was a kid my only wish was to get my line in him 
Skipped church one Sunday rowed out and throw'd in my line 
Jim took that hook pole and me right over the side 
Went driftin' down past old tires and rusty cans of beer 
The angel of the lake whispered in my ear 
"Before you choose your wish son 
You better think first 
With every wish there comes a curse" 

I fell in love with beautiful Doreen 
She was the prettiest thing this old town'd ever seen 
I courted her and I made her mine 
But I grew jealous whenever another man'd 
Come walkin' down the line 
And my jealousy made me treat her hard and cruel 
She sighed "Bobby oh Bobby you're such a fool 
Don't you know before you choose your wish 
You'd better think first 
'Cause with every wish there comes a curse" 

These days I sit around and laugh 
At the many rivers I've crossed 
But on the far banks there's always another forest 
Where a man can get lost 
Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides 
Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side 
And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes 
And though my heart's grown weary 
And more than a little bit shy 
Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst 
And leave the angels to worry 
With every wish...
