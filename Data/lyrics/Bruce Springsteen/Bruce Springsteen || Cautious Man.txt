Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road 
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code 
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need 
And then very carefully he'd proceed 

Billy met a young girl in the early days of May 
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away 
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim 
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him 

On his right hand Billy'd tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear 
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear 
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride 
And with his own hands built her a great house down by the riverside 

Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right 
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving night 
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray 
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay 

One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name 
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away 
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode 
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road 

Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name 
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain 
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white 
Filling their room in the beauty of God's fallen light
