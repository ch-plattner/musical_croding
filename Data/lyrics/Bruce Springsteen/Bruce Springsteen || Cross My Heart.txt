
First time I crossed my heart 
I was beggin' baby please 
At your bedside down on my knees 
When I crossed my heart 
When I crossed my heart 
I crossed my heart pretty baby over you 

Second time I crossed my heart 
Rain came in from the south 
I was lyin' there with something sweet and salty in my mouth 
When I crossed my heart 
When I crossed my heart 
When I crossed my heart pretty darlin' over you 

Well you may think the world's black and white 
And you're dirty or you're clean 
You better watch out you don't slip 
Through them spaces in between 

Where the night gets sticky 
And the sky gets black 
I grabbed you baby you grabbed me back 
And we crossed our hearts 
We crossed our hearts 
Yeah I crossed my heart... 

Little boys little girls 
They know their wrongs from their rights 
Once you crossed your heart 
You ain't ever supposed to lie 

Well life ain't nothin' 
But a cold hard ride 
I ain't leavin' 'til I'm satisfied 
I cross my heart 
Yeah I cross my heart 
Well I cross my heart pretty darlin' over you
