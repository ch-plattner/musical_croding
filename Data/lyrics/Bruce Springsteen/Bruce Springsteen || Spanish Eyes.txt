Little Christine
We're takin' one more run
Secret heart, when the time has begun
Come to part
And hey, you're the one
And now we know
My heart is sold
And though we tried
You took me with your spanish eyes

Hey badlands
Realize
That someone else is yearning
Special sunday night
And baby there's time
Time enough to cry
With all our sad stories
And all the bad that we've done
And all the times
we've rode on for glory
And ...
And you took me with your spanish eyes

Stretch out baby
And call your daddy home
'Cause I'm runnin' tonight
Couldn't be all alone
Yes I know how something died
But baby it was just for kicks
It was just for fun
Even with all the bad that we done
They can't say we didn't try
And I fell for your Spanish eyes

Saturday night special
Waitin' in the sheets
Oh come on
Talk to me, my sweet
And I'll try to make it complete this time
Come close and let me dry your eyes
Let me try to turn the lies
And let me kiss your spanish eyes
Let me kiss your spanish eyes
Let me kiss your spanish eyes
Let me kiss your spanish eyes
Come here, baby
