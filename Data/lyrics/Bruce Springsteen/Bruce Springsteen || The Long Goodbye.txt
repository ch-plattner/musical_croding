
My soul went walkin' but I stayed here 
Feel like I been workin' for a thousand years 
Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies 
Climbin' a wall a hundred miles high 
Well I woke up this morning on the other side 
Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye 
Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 

Same old faces it's the same old town 
What once was laughs is draggin' me now 
Waitin' on rain hangin' on for love 
Words of forgiveness from some God above 
Ain't no words of mercy comin' from on high 
Oh no just a long goodbye 
Yeah yeah just one long goodbye 

Well I went to leave twenty years ago 
Since then I guess I been packin' kinda slow 
Sure did like that admirin' touch 
Guess I liked it a little too much 

The moon is high and here I am 
Sittin' here with this hammer in hand 
One more drink oughta ease the pain 
Starin' at that last link in the chain 
Well let's raise our glass and let the hammer fly 
Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
Kiss me baby and we're gonna fly 
Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye 
Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
Kiss me baby 'cause we're gonna ride 
Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye
