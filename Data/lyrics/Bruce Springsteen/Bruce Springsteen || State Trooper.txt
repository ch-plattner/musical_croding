New Yersey Turnpike ridin' on a wet night 'neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flow 
License, registration, I ain't got none, but I got a clear conscience 
'Bout the things that I done 
Mister state trooper please don't stop me... 

Maybe you got a kid maybe you got a pretty wife, the only thing that I got's been botherin' me my whole life 
Mister state trooper please don't stop me 

In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy, radio relay towers lead me to my baby 
Radio's jammed up with talk show stations 
It's just talk, talk, talk till you lose your patience 
Mister state trooper please don't stop me 

Hey somebody out there, listen to my last prayer 
Hi ho silver-o deliver me from nowhere
