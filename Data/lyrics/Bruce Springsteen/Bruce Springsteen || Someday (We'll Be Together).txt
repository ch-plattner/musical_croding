
Your voice comes calling through the mist
I awake from a dream and my heart begins to drift
Tonight we're on our own
Tonight we're all alone
Oh-oh, tonight

Someday we'll be together
And the night will fall around us
This love will last forever
Someday we'll be together
Together

I can't sleep so I lay awake listenin' to the sounds of the city below
I get dressed and walk the streets but I got nowhere to go
Tonight it's you I miss
Tonight my only wish is
Oh-oh, tonight

Someday we'll be together
And the night will fall around us
This love will last forever
Someday you'll be mine

Tonight we're on our own
Tonight we're all alone
Oh-oh, tonight

Someday we'll be together
And the night will fall around us
This love will last forever
Someday you'll be mine
Woah-whoaaa
Someday you'll be mine
Woah-whoaaa (this love will last forever)
Someday you'll be mine
(Someday we'll be together)
(The night will fall around us)
(This love will last forever)
(Someday you'll be mine)
(Someday we'll be together)
[Fades Out]
