Well now on a summer night in a dusky room 
Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light 
Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon 
In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take 
Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make 
In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused 
Searching for a little bit of God's mercy 
I found living proof 

I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf 
Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself 
I went down into the desert city 
Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin 
I crawled deep into some kind of darkness 
Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been 
You do some sad sad things baby 
When it's you you're tryin' to lose 
You do some sad and hurtful things 
I've seen living proof 

You shot through my anger and rage 
To show me my prison was just an open cage 
There were no keys no guards 
Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars 

Well now all that's sure on the boulevard 
Is that life is just a house of cards 
As fragile as each and every breath 
Of this boy sleepin' in our bed 
Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves 
Just a close band of happy thieves 
And when that train comes we'll get on board 
And steal what we can from the treasures treasures of the Lord 
It's been a long long drought baby 
Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof 
Looking for a little bit of God's mercy 
I found living proof
