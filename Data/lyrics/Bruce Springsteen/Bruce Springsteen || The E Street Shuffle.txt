Sparks fly on E Street when the boy- prophets walk it, handsome and hot 
All the little girls' souls grow weak when the man-child gives them a double shot 
The schoolboy pops pull out all the stops on a Friday night 
The teenage tramps in skin-tight pants do the E Street dance and everything's alright 
Little kids down there either dancin' or hooked up in a scuffle 
Dressed in snakeskin suits packed with Detroit muscle 
They're doin' the E Street Shuffle 

Now those E Street brats in twilight dual flashlight phantoms in full star stream 
Down fire trails of silver nights with blonde girls pledged sweet 16 
The newsboys say the heat's been bad since Power 13 gave a trooper all he had in a summer scuffle 
And Power's girl, Little Angel, has been on the corner keepin' those crazy boys out of trouble 
Little Angel steps the shuffle like she ain't got no brains 
She's deaf in combat down on Lover's Lane 
She drives all them local boys insane 

Little Angel says, "Oh, everybody form a line 
Oh, everybody form a line" 

Sparks fly on E Street when the boy- prophets walk it, handsome and hot 
All the little girls' souls grow weak when the man-child gives them a double shot 
Little Angel hangs out at Easy Joe's, it's a club where all the riot squad goes when they're cashin' in for a cheap hustle 
But them boys are still on the corner, loose and doin' that lazy E Street Shuffle 
As them sweet summer nights turn into summer dreams 
Little Angel picks up Power and he slips on his jeans as they move on out down to the scene 
All the kids are dancin'
