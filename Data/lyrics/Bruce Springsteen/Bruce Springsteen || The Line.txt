I got my discharge from Fort Irwin 
Took a place on the San Diego county line 
Felt funny bein' a civilian again 
It'd been some time 
My wife had died a year ago 
I was still tryin' to find my way back whole 
Went to work for the INS on the line 
With the California border patrol 

Bobby Ramirez was a ten-year veteran 
We became friends 
His family was from Guanajuato 
So the job it was different for him 
He said "They risk death in the deserts and mountains 
Pay all they got to the smugglers rings 
We send 'em home and they come right back again 
Carl hunger is a powerful thing." 

Well I was good at doin' what I was told 
Kept my uniform pressed and clean 
At night I chased their shadows 
Through the arroyos and ravines 
Drug runners farmers with their families 
Young women with little children by their sides 
Come night we'd wait out in the canyons 
And try to keep 'em from crossin' the line 

Well the first time that I saw her 
She was in the holdin' pen 
Our eyes met and she looked away 
Then she looked back again 
Her hair was black as coal 
Her eyes reminded me of what I'd lost 
She had a young child cryin' in her arms 
I asked "Se√±ora is there anything I can do ?" 

There's a bar in Tijuana 
Where me and Bobby drink alongside 
The same people we'd sent back the day before 
She said her name was Louisa 
She was from Sonora and had just come north 
We danced and I held her in my arms 
And I knew what I would do 
She said she had some family in Madera county 
If she her child and younger brother could just get through 

At night they come across the levee 
In the searchlight's dusty glow 
We'd rush 'em in our Broncos 
Force 'em back down into the river below 
She climbed into my truck 
She leaned toward me and we kissed 
As we drove her brother's shirt slipped open 
And I saw the tape across his chest 

We were just about on the highway 
When Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right 
I pulled over and let my engine run 
And stepped out into his lights 
I felt myself movin' 
My gun restin' 'neath my hand 
We stood there starin' at each other 
As off through the arroyo she ran 

Bobby Ramirez he never said nothin' 
Six months later I left the line 
I drifted to the central valley 
And took what work that I could find 
At night I searched the local bars 
And the migrant towns 
Lookin' for my Louisa 
With the black hair fallin' down
