
I had a friend was a big baseball player 
back in high school 
He could throw that speedball by you 
Make you look like a fool boy 
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar 
I was walking in, he was walking out 
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks 
but all he kept talking about was 

[Chorus:]
Glory days well they'll pass you by 
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye 
Glory days, glory days 

Well there's a girl that lives up the block 
back in school she could turn all the boy's heads 
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by 
and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed 
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up 
I guess it's two years gone by now 
We just sit around talking about the old times, 
she says when she feels like crying 
she starts laughing thinking about 

[Chorus]

My old man worked 20 years on the line 
and they let him go 
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work 
they just tell him that he's too old 
I was 9 nine years old and he was working at the 
Metuchen Ford plant assembly line 
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion hall 
but I can tell what's on his mind 

Glory days yeah goin back 
Glory days aw he ain't never had 
Glory days, glory days 

Now I think I'm going down to the well tonight 
and I'm going to drink till I get my fill 
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it 
but I probably will 
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture 
a little of the glory of, well time slips away 
and leaves you with nothing mister but 
boring stories of glory days 

[Chorus (repeat twice)]
