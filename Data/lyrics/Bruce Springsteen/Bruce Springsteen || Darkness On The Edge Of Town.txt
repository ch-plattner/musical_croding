
They're still racing out at the Trestles, 
But that blood it never burned in her veins, 
Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview, 
And a style she's trying to maintain. 
Well, if she wants to see me, 
You can tell her that I'm easily found, 
Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge, 
And tell her, there's a darkness on the edge of town. 

Everybody's got a secret, Sonny, 
Something that they just can't face, 
Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it, 
They carry it with them every step that they take. 
Till some day they just cut it loose 
Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down, 
Where no one asks any questions, 
or looks too long in your face, 
In the darkness on the edge of town. 

Some folks are born into a good life, 
Other folks get it anyway, anyhow, 
I lost my money and I lost my wife, 
Them things don't seem to matter much to me now. 
Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop, 
I'll be on that hill with everything I got, 
Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost, 
I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost, 
For wanting things that can only be found 
In the darkness on the edge of town.
