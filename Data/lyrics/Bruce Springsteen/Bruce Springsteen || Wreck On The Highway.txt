
Last night I was out driving 
Coming home at the end of the working day 
I was riding alone through the drizzling rain 
On a deserted stretch of a county two-lane 
When I came upon a wreck on the highway 

There was blood and glass all over 
And there was nobody there but me 
As the rain tumbled down hard and cold 
I seen a young man lying by the side of the road 
He cried Mister, won't you help me please 

An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside 
I watched as they drove him away 
And I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife 
And a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night 
To say your baby died in a wreck on the highway 

Sometimes I sit up in the darkness 
And I watch my baby as she sleeps 
Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight 
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night 
Thinking 'bout the wreck on the highway
