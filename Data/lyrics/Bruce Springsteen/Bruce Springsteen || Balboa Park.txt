
He lay his blanket underneath the freeway 
As the evening sky grew dark 
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can 
And headed through Balboa Park 
Where the men in their Mercedes 
Come nightly to employ 
In the cool San Diego evening 
The services of the border boys 

He grew up near the Zona Norte 
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with 
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine 
Brought 'em across to the Twelfth Street strip 
Sleeping in a shelter 
If the night got too cold 
Runnin' from the migra 
Of the border patrol 

Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks 
And in through the storm drain 
They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway 
And each one took a name 
There was X-man and Cochise 
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud 
They come north to California 
End up with the poison in their blood 

He did what he had to for the money 
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare 
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho 
And jeans like the gavachos wear 

One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street 
A big car come fast down the boulevard 
Spider stood caught in its headlights 
Got hit and went down hard 
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach 
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass 
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue 
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars 
Rushin' by so fast
