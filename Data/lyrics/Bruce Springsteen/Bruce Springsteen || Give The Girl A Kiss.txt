Well now I ain't lookin' for excitement
Baby that's just a fact
If you want to get to her heart
You better let her know just where you're at

Well I say It ain't written in the sky above
Well no fortune-teller told me this
You gotta tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
And give the girl a great big kiss
Alright, give the girl a great big kiss

Now if you're such a fool you think
It don't matter, baby, what you say
Maybe you better tell her how you're feelin'
It ain't gonna happen any other way

'Cause darlin' it ain't written in the sky above
Well don't you tell her who told me this
You gotta tell her that you need her
Tell her that you love her
And give the girl a great big kiss
Yeah you better give the girl a great big kiss

Now baby all I wanna do
Is darlin' make sweet love to you

Danny!
Boss time!

Now I don't know what the meanin' is
Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say
But baby it's just a natural fact
Love was never meant to be that way

And darlin' it ain't written in the sky above
Well no fortune-teller told me this
You gotta tell her that you need her
Tell her that you love her
And give the girl a great big kiss
I say give the girl a great big kiss
Repeat that!
I say give the girl a great big, great big, great
Now give the girl a great big, great big
You gotta give the girl a great big, great big
You gotta give the girl a great big kiss

Well now darlin' all I wanna do
Is darlin' make sweet love to you

Give the girl a great big, great big, great big
Give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big, great big, great big
Give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big, great big, great big
Give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big, great big, great big
Give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big, great big, great big
Give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big kiss
