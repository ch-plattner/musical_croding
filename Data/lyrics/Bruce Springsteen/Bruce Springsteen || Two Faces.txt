
I met a girl and we ran away 
I swore I'd make her happy every day 
And how I made her cry 
Two faces have I 

Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild 
Lord I love to see my baby smile 
Then dark clouds come rolling by 
Two faces have I 

One that laughs one that cries 
One says hello one says goodbye 
One does things I don't understand 
Makes me feel like half a man 

At night I get down on my knees and pray 
Our love will make that other man go away 
But he'll never say goodbye 
Two faces have I 

Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree 
He swore he'd take your love away from me 
He said our life was just a lie 
And two faces have I 
Well go ahead and let him try
