Got out of prison back in '86 and I found a wife 
Walked the clean and narrow 
Just tryin' to stay out and stay alive 
Got a job at the rendering plant, it ain't gonna make me rich 
In the darkness before dinner comes 
Sometimes I can feel the itch 
I got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
I'm sick of doin' straight time 

My uncle's at the evenin' table, makes his living runnin' hot cars 
Slips me a hundred dollar bill says 
"Charlie you best remember who your friends are." 
Got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
I ain't makin' straight time 

Eight years in it feels like you're gonna die 
But you get used to anything 
Sooner or later it just becomes your life 

Kitchen floor in the evening tossin' my little babies high 
Mary's smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye 
Seems you can't get any more than half free 
I step out onto the front porch and suck the cold air deep inside of me 
Got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
I'm sick of doin' straight time 

In the basement huntin' gun and a hacksaw 
Sip a beer and thirteen inches of barrel drop to the floor 

Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands 
Lay my head down on the pillow 
And go driftin' off into foreign lands
