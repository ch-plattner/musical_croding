The screen door slams 
Mary' dress waves 
Like a vision she dances across the porch 
As the radio plays 
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely 
Hey that's me and I want you only 
Don't turn me home again 
I just can't face myself alone again 
Don't run back inside 
Darling you know just what I'm here for 
So you're scared and you're thinking 
That maybe we ain't that young anymore 
Show a little faith there's magic in the night 
You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright 
Oh and that's alright with me 

You can hide 'neath your covers 
And study your pain 
Make crosses from your lovers 
Throw roses in the rain 
Waste your summer praying in vain 
For a saviour to rise from these streets 
Well now I'm no hero 
That's understood 
All the redemption I can offer girl 
Is beneath this dirty hood 
With a chance to make it good somehow 
Hey what else can we do now ? 
Except roll down the window 
And let the wind blow 
Back your hair 
Well the night's busting open 
These two lanes will take us anywhere 
We got one last chance to make it real 
To trade in these wings on some wheels 
Climb in back 
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks 
Oh-oh come take my hand 
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land 
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road 
Lying out there like a killer in the sun 
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run 
Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold 
Thunder Road 

Well I got this guitar 
And I learned how to make it talk 
And my car's out back 
If you're ready to take that long walk 
From your front porch to my front seat 
The door's open but the ride it ain't free 
And I know you're lonely 
For words that I ain't spoken 
But tonight we'll be free 
All the promises'll be broken 
There were ghosts in the eyes 
Of all the boys you sent away 
They haunt this dusty beach road 
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets 
They scream your name at night in the street 
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet 
And in the lonely cool before dawn 
You hear their engines roaring on 
But when you get to the porch they're gone 
On the wind so Mary climb in 
It's town full of losers 
And I'm pulling out of here to win
