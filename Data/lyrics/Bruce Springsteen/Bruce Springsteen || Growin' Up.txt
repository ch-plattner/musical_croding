
I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade 
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade 
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch 
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched 
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Sit down," I stood up 
Ooh... growin' up 

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing 
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing 
I pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing 
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing 
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Come down," I threw up 
Ooh... growin' up 

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath 
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress 
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars 
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car 
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up 
Ooh... growin' up 
Ooh... growin' up
