
Well in Candy's room there are pictures of her savior on the wall
But to get to Candy's room you've gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall
Strangers from the city call my baby's number and they bring Candy toys
But when I come knockin' she smiles pretty
She knows tonight I'm gonna be Candy's boy

Well in the olden days when the Mongolian gangs rode herd out on Route 9
We'd go riding in the rain runnin' south way down through the pines
Weekends in the sun in that cheap motel down by the dynamo
We loved each other till there was nothin' left
And drove that old car as hard and fast as she would go

Well like a cold winter wind blowing in babe I needed you
But Candy's got a man who takes care of her better than I do
Well there's machines and there's fire
Waiting for us on the edge of town
And there's some roughboys for hire
And they're waiting to blow me and Candy down
It's all right 'cause they can't touch us now they'll never destroy
My sweet love for I will forever be Candy's boy
My sweet love for I will forever be Candy's boy
