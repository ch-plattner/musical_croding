
I remember how rough your hand felt on mine 
On my wedding day 
And the tears cried on my shoulder 
I couldn't turn away 
Well so much has happened to me 
That I don't understand 
All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach 
Tracing your footprints in the sand 
Trying to walk like a man 

By Our Lady of the Roses 
We lived in the shadow of the elms 
I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church 
Whenever she heard those wedding bells 
Well would they ever look so happy again 
The handsome groom and his bride 
As they stepped into that long black limousine 
For their mystery ride 
Well tonight you step away from me 
And alone at the altar I stand 
And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray 
For the strength to walk like a man 

Well now the years have gone and I've grown 
From that seed you've sown 
But I didn't think there'd be so many steps 
I'd have to learn on my own 
Well I was young and I didn't know what to do 
When I saw your best steps stolen away from you 
Now I'll do what I can 
I'll walk like a man 
And I'll keep on walkin'
