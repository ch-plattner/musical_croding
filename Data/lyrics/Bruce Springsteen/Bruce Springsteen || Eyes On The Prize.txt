Had no money to go their bail 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Paul and Silas thought 
They was lost 
Dungeon shook and 
The chains come off 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Freedom's name is mighty sweet 
And soon we're gonna meet 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

I got my hand on the gospel plow 
Won't take nothing for 
My journey now 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Hold on, Hold on 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Only chain that a man can stand 
Is that chain o'hand 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

I gonna board 
That big Greyhound 
Carry the love from 
Town to town 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Hold on, Hold on 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

The only thing I did was wrong 
Was staying' in the 
Wilderness too long 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 
The only thing I did was right 
Was the day we started to fight 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Hold on, Hold on 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Hold on, Hold on 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Hold on, Hold on 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Hold on 

Ain't been to heaven 
But I been told 
Streets up there are 
Paved with gold
