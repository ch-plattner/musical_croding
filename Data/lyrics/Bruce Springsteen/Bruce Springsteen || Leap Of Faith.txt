
All over the world the rain was pourin' 
I was scratchin' where it itched 
Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring 
So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch 

It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts 
It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
In your heart you must trust 

Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar 
Your body was the holy land 
You shouted "jump" but my heart faltered 
You laughted and said "Baby don't you understand ?" 

It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts 
It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
In your heart you must trust 

Now you were the Red Sea I was Moses 
I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses 
The waters parted and love rushed inside 
I was Jesus' son sanctified 

Tonight the moon's looking young but I'm feelin' younger 
'Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain 
Honey I can feel the first breeze of summer 
And in your love I'm born again 

It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts 
It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
In your heart you must trust
