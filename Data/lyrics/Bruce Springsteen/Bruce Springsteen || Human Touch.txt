
You and me we were the pretenders 
We let it all slip away 
In the end what you don't surrender 
Well the world just strips away 

Girl ain't no kindness in the face of strangers 
Ain't gonna find no miracles here 
Well you can wait on your blessings darlin' 
But I got a deal for you right here 

I ain't lookin' for prayers or pity 
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch 
I just want someone to talk to 
And a little of that human touch 
Just a little of that human touch 

Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town 
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies 
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood 
It's just you and me tonight 

Tell me in a world without pity 
Do you uthink what I'm askin's too much ? 
I just want something to hold on to 
And a little of that human touch 
Just a little of that human touch 

Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize 
Well it comes with a hard hard price 
You can't shut off the risk and pain 
Without losin' the love that remains 
We're all riders on this train 

So you been broken and you been hurt 
Show me soomebody who ain't 
Yeah I know I ain't nobody's bargain 
But hell a little touchup 
And a little paint... 

You might need somethin' to hold on to 
When all the answers they don't amount to much 
Somebody that you can just talk to 
And a little of that human touch 

Baby in a world without pity 
Do you think what I'm askin's too much ? 
I just want to feel you in my arms 
And share a little of that human touch...
