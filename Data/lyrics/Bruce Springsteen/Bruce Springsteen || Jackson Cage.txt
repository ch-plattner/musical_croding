
Driving home she grabs something to eat 
Turns a corner and drives down her street 
Into a row of houses she just melts away 
Like the scenery in another man's play 
Into a house where the blinds are closed 
To keep from seeing things she don't wanna know 
She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street 
The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat 

In the Jackson Cage 
Down in the Jackson Cage 
You can try with all your might 
But you're reminded every night 
That you been judged and handed life 
Down in the Jackson Cage 

Every day ends in wasted motion 
Just crossed swords on the killing floor 
To settle back is to settle without knowing 
The hard edge that you're settling for 
Because there's always just one more day 
And it's always gonna be that way 
Little girl you've been down here so long 
I can tell by the way that you move you belong to 

The Jackson Cage 
Down in Jackson Cage 
And it don't matter just what you say 
Are you tough enough to play the game they play 
Or will you just do your time and fade away 
Down into the Jackson Cage 

Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world 
But I wake up so downhearted girl 
I see you feeling so tired and confused 
I wonder what it's worth to me or you 
Just waiting to see some sun 
Never knowing if that day will ever come 
Left alone standing out on the street 
Till you become the hand that turns the key down in 

Jackson Cage 
Down in Jackson Cage 
Well darlin' can you understand 
The way that they will turn a man 
Into a stranger to waste away 
Down in the Jackson Cage
