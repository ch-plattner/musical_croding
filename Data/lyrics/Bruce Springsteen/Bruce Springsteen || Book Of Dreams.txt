
I'm standing in the backyard 
Listening to the party inside 
Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness 
This life provides 
The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems 
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams 

I'm watchin' you through the window 
With your girlfriends from back home 
You're showin' off your dress 
There's laughter and a toast 
From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen 
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams 

In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin 
I feel your sweet reply 
The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high 
Just holdin' you to me 
As through the window the moonlight streams 
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams 

Now the ritual begins 
'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers 
The dance floor is alive with beauty 
Mystery and danger 
We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees 
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams
