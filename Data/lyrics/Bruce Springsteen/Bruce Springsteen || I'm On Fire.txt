
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do? Oh, no.
I can take you higher
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby,
Edgy and dull,
And cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull.

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire [3x]
