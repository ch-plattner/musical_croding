Hey, little dolly with the blue jeans on 
I wanna ramrod with you honey, till half-past dawn 
Let your hair down sugar and pick up this beat 
Come on and meet me tonight down on Bluebird Street 
I've been working all week, I'm up to my neck in hock 
Come Saturday night I let my ramrod rock 

She's a hot stepping hemi with a four on the floor 
She's a roadrunner engine in a '32 Ford 
Late at night when I'm dead on the line 
I swear I think of your pretty face when I let her unwind 
Well look over yonder see them city lights 
Come on little dolly 'n' go ramroddin' tonight 

Come on, come on, come on little baby 
Come on, come on let's shake it tonight 
Come on, come, come on little sugar 
Dance with your daddy and we'll go ramroddin' tonight 

Hey, little dolly won't you say you will 
Meet me tonight up on top of the hill 
Well just a few miles cross the county line 
There's a cute little chapel nestled down in the pines 
Say you'll be mine little girl I'll put my foot to the floor 
Give me the word now sugar, we'll go ramroddin' forever more
