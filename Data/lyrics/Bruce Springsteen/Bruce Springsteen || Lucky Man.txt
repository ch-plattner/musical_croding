Running down the highway half-past eleven
Waitin' for my odometer to roll straight sevens
I'm a lucky man
I went to see the gypsy the other night
She looked in my palm, looked me in the eye
And said "You're a lucky man"

"Some folks got fortune, some got eyes of blue
What you got will always see you through
You're a lucky man"
Pa went from the army to the factory to the killin' yard
I make my living with my hands 'hind the wheel of this car
I'm a lucky man

Messin' with me, man, wouldn't be wise
Roll them dice, son ... snake eyes
I'm a lucky man

Had a girl in Calgary, I gave her up
Man, that love thing was messin' with my luck
And I'm a lucky man
I'll wake up tomorrow morning in another state
Kiss me now, baby before it's too late
If you wanna kiss a lucky man
I don't miss no girl, I don't miss no home
He travels fastest who travels alone
He's a lucky man
A man with the world in the palm of his hands
