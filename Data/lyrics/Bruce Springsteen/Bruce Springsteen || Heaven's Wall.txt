(Raise your hands, raise your hands, raise your handsâ€¦)

There was a woman waiting at the well
Drawing water 'neath a desert sky of blue
She said "He'll heal the blind, raise the dead
Cure that sickness out of you"

Come on men of Gideon
Come all men of Saul
Come all sons of Abraham
Waiting outside heaven's wall

Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
And together we'll walk into Canaan land
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand

He saw the watcher at the city gates
Jonah in the belly of the whale
He watched you walk your ragged mile
His mercy did not fail

Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
And together we'll walk into Canaan land
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand

Lai, lai, lai lai lai, lai lai, lai lai, lai lai lai

Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
And together we'll walk into Canaan land
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand
[x4]
