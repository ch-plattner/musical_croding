Tell her to push over and move them big feet 
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency 
Well this morning I ain't fighting tell her I give up 
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up 
But it's the last time that she's gonna be riding with me 

You can tell her there's a hot sun beating on the black top 
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block 
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight 
Well I got some beer and the highway's free 
And I got you, and baby you've got me 
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' 

Now there's girls melting on the beach 
And they're so fine but so out of reach 
Cause I'm stuck in traffic down, here on 53rd Street 
Now Sherry my love for you is real 
But I didn't count on this package deal 
And baby this car just ain't big enough for her and me 

So you can tell her there's a hot sun beating on the black top 
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block 
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight 
Well I got some beer and the highway's free 
And I got you, and baby you got me 
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' 

Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain 
Let the brokenhearted love again 
Sherry we can run with our arms open before the tide 
To all the girls down at Sacred Heart 
And all you operators back in the Park 
Say hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' 
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin'
