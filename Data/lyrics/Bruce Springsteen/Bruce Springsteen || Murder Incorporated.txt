Out on the street your chances are zero 
Take a look around you (come on now) 
It ain't too complicated 
You're messin' with Murder Incorporated 

Now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go 
Walkin' down the street there's eyes in every shadow 
You better take a look around you (come on now) 
That equipment you got's so outdated 
You can't compete with Murder Incorporated 
Everywhere you look now, Murder Incorporated 

So you keep a little secret down deep inside your dresser drawer 
For dealing with the heat you're feelin' out on the killin' floor 
No matter where you step you feel you're never out of danger 
So the comfort that you keep's a gold-plated-snub-nose-thirty-two 
I heard you 

You got a job downtown, man that leaves your head cold 
Everywhere you look life ain't got no soul 
That apartment you live in feels like it's just a place to hide 
When you're walkin' down the street you won't meet no one eye to eye 
The cops reported you as just an another homicide 
But I can tell that you were just frustrated 
From living with Murder Incorporated 
Everywhere you look now, Murder Incorporated 
Murder Incorporated
