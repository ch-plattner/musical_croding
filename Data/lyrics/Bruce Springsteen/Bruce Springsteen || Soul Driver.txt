Rode through forty nights of the gospels' rain 
Black sky pourin' snakes frogs 
And love in vain 
You were down where the river grows wider 
Baby let me be your soul driver 

Well if something in the air feels a little unkind 
Don't worry darlin' 
It'll slip your mind 
I'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider 
Baby let me be your soul driver 

Now no one knows which way love's wheel turns 
Will we hit it rich 
Or crash and burn 
Does fortune wait or just the black hand of fate 
This love potion's all we've got 
One toast before it's too late 

If the angels are unkind or the season is dark 
Or if in the end 
Love just falls apart 
Then here's to our destruction 
Baby let me be your soul driver
