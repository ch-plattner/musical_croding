He rode the rails since the Great Depression 
Fifty years out on the skids 
He said "You don't cross nobody 
You'll be all right out here kid." 

Left my family in Pennsylvania 
Searchin' for work I hit the road 
I met Frank in East Texas 
In a freight yard blown through with snow 
From New Mexico to Colorado 
California to the sea 
Frank he showed me the ropes sir 
Just till I could get back on my feet 

I hoed sugar beets outside of Firebaugh 
I picked the peaches from the Marysville trees 
They bunked us in a barn just like animals 
Me and a hundred others just like me 

We split up come the springtime 
I never seen Frank again 
'Cept one rainy night he blew by me on a grainer 
Shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind 

They found him shot dead outside of Stockton 
His body lyin' on a muddy hill 
Nothin' taken nothin' stolen 
Somebody killin' just to kill 

Late that summer I was rollin' through the plains of Texas 
A vision passed before my eyes 
A small house sittin' trackside 
With the glow of the savior's beautiful light 
A woman stood cookin' in the kitchen 
Kid sat at a table with his old man 
Now I wonder does my son miss me 
Does he wonder where I am 

Tonight I pick my campsite carefully 
Outside the Sacramento yard 
Gather some wood and light a fire 
In the early winter dark 

Wind whistling cold I pull my coat around me 
Heat some coffee and stare out into the black night 
I lie awake I lie awake sir 
With my machete by my side 

My Jesus your gracious love and mercy 
Tonight I'm sorry could not fill my heart 
Like one good rifle 
And the name of who I ought to kill
