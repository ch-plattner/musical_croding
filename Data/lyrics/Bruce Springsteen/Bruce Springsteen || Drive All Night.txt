
When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too 
And I wish God would send me a word send me something I'm afraid to lose 
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives 
I get shivers down my spine and all I wanna do is hold you tight 

I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes 
And to taste your tender charms 
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms 

Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street 
Tonight there's calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat. 
Let them go, let them go, let them go do their dances of the dead (let 'em go right ahead) 
You just dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon c'mon let's go to bed, baby, baby, baby 

I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes 
And to taste your tender charms 
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms 

There's machines and there's fire waiting on the edge of town 
They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now 
Cause you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got my love, you've got my love 
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain 
You've got, you've got my, my love heart and soul
