Well, Billy bought a Chevy '40 coupe deluxe
Chrome wheels, stick shift (hey!), give her gas, pop the clutch
Little girls on the corner like a diamond they shine
Someday, Billy, I'm gonna make 'em all mine

Hey girl, you wanna ride in Daddy's Cadillac
Because I love the way your long hair (hey!) falls down your back
Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley at the Seaside Bar
We'll run barefoot in the sand and listen to his guitar

You say your mama's gonna meet you when the morning comes
Yeah, and papa's gonna beat you because he knows you're out on the run
I'm gonna live a life of love and tonight you're the one

The highway is alive tonight so baby do not be frightened
There's something about a pretty girl on a sweet summer night that gets this boy excited
The radio man finally understands and plays you something you can move to
You lay back easy, cut loose your drive power, your girl leans over, says
"Daddy can you turn that radio up any louder?"

Ah, the juke joints humming, everybody came down
Little Willie and the Soul Brooms (hey!) laying all his stuff down
Well, don't let that daylight steal your soul
Get in your wheels and roll, roll, roll, roll, oh, oh, oh
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh) Oh that's right now! (Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh go on, go on, go on! (Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)

Oh mama gonna meet you when the morning comes, yeah
And your daddy gonna beat you because he knows you're out on the run
But I don't care, I wanna live a life of love while the night's still young
Alright now!

(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh)
