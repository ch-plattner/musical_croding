I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town
I heard about that story going round round
All I got's a book of love with pages worn clean through
A circle of gold and one bleeding tattoo
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)

This town's a secret shared and shattered in a sad song
Just torn and tattered pieces of a love gone wrong
Hearts of stone and eyes gone deep blue
Lonely houses filled two by two
Mary, Mary, where have you run to
(Mary, Mary, where have you run to)

Summer storm blew in soft and cool
On the slinky town streets where love ruled
Now it's just a misty sidewalk with the rain drifting through
Lipstick case and one lonely red shoe
Mary, Mary, where have you run to
(Mary, Mary, where have you run to)
Mary, Mary, where have you run to
(Mary, Mary, where have you run to)
Mary, Mary, where have you run to
(Mary, Mary, where have you run to)
I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town
