
You get up every morning at the sound of the bell 
You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell 
Till you're out on a midnight run 
Losing your heart to a beautiful one 
And it feels right as you lock up the house 
Turn out the lights and step out into the night 

And the world is busting at its seams 
And you're just a prisoner of your dreams 
Holding on for your life 'cause you work all day 
To blow 'em away in the night 

The rat traps filled with soul crusaders 
The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders 
And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars 
As you jockey your way through the cars 
And sit at the light, as it changes to green 
With your faith in your machine off you scream into the night 

And you're in love with all the wonder it brings 
And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites 
You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night 
Hell all day they're busting you up on the outside 
But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside 
And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight 

And you know she will be waiting there 
And you'll find her somehow you swear 
Somewhere tonight you run sad and free 
Until all you can see is the night
