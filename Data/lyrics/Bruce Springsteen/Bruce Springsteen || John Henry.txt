
Well John Henry was a little baby 
Sittin' on his daddy's knee 
He picked up a hammer and 
a little piece of steel 
And cried, "Hammer's gonna 
be death of me, Lord, Lord 
Hammer's gonna be the death of me" 

Now the captain he 
said to John Henry 
"I'm gonna bring that 
steam drill around 
I'm gonna bring that 
steam drill out on these tracks 
I'm gonna knock that 
steel on down, God, God 
I'm gonna knock that 
steel on down" 

John Henry told his captain 
"Lord a man ain't noth' but a man 
But before I let that steam drill 
beat me down 
I'm gonna die with a hammer 
in my hand, Lord, Lord 
I'll die with a hammer in my hand" 

John Henry driving 
on the right side 
That steam drill driving 
on the left 
Says, "Fore I let your 
steam drill beat me down 
I'm gonna hammer 
myself to death, Lord, Lord, 
I'll hammer my fool self to death" 

Well captain said to John Henry 
"What is that storm I hear?" 
John Henry said, "That 
ain't no storm captain 
That's just my hammer 
in the air, Lord, Lord 
That's just my hammer in the air" 

John Henry said to his shaker 
"Shaker, why don't you sing? 
Cause I'm swingin' thirty pounds 
from my hips on down 
Yeah, listen to my cold steel 
ring, Lord Lord 

Listen to my cold steel ring" 

John Henry he hammered 
in the mountains 
His hammer was striking fire 
But he worked so hard; 
it broke his heart 
John Henry laid down his hammer 
and died, Lord, Lord 

John Henry laid down his hammer and died 

Well, now John Henry 
he had him a woman 
By the name of Polly Ann 
She walked out to those tracks 
Picked up John Henry's hammer 
Polly drove steel like a man, Lord, Lord 
Polly drove that steel like a man 

Well every, every Monday morning 
When a blue bird he began to sing 
You could hear John Henry 
from a mile or more 
You could hear John Henry's hammer 
ring, Lord, Lord 
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring 
I say, You can John Henry's 
hammer ring, Lord, Lord 
You can John Henry's 
hammer ring
