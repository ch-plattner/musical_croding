Her brains they rattle and her bones they shake
Oh she's an angel from the Innerlake
Her brains they rattle and her bones they shake
Oh she's an angel from the Innerlake
Don't dance with her Henry, don't you dance with her Jake (her brains they rattle and her bones they shake)
Oh she's an angel from the Innerlake
She gives me all the loving that a good man can take (her brains they rattle and her bones they shake)
Oh she's an angel from the Innerlake

(Sha-na, na-na, na na, oh oh)
(Sha-na, na-na, na na, oh oh)
(Sha-na, na-na, na na, oh oh)
(Sha-na, na-na, na na, oh oh)
Thundercrack, baby's back
This time she'll tell me how she really feels
Bring me down to her lightning shack
You can watch my partner reeling
She moves up, she moves back
Out on the floor there just is no one cleaner
She does this thing she calls the "jump back jack"
She's got the heart of a ballerina

Straight from the Bronx, hung off the line
Still she slides, she slops, she bops, she bumps, she grinds
Even them dance hall hacks from the west side of the track move in close to catch her timing
She moves up, she moves back
Out on the floor there just is no one cleaner
She does this thing she calls the "jump back jack"
She's got the heart of a ballerina

Oh, she ain't no little girl, no, she ain't got no curls
Her hair ain't brown and her eyes ain't either
Round and round and round
(Round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round)
(Round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round)

My heart's wood, she's a carpenter
She's an angel in the night, what she does is alright
Dance with me, partner
Dance with me, partner
Dance with me, partner, 'til the dawn
Baby, all night long

(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-ohhh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-ohhh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-ohhh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-ohhh oh-oh oh-oh)

Thundercrack, (baby's back)
This time she'll tell me how she really feels
Brings me down to her lightning shack
You can watch my partner reeling
She moves up, she moves back
Out on the floor there just is no one cleaner
She does this thing she calls the "jump back jack"
She's got the heart of a ballerina

Oh, she ain't no little girl, no, she ain't got no curls
Her hair ain't brown and her eyes ain't either
Round and round and round
(Round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round)
(Round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round)

My heart's wood, she's a carpenter
She's an angel in the night, what she does is alright
Dance with me, partner
Dance with me, partner
Dance with me, partner
All night, (all night)
All night, (all night)
All night, (all night)
All night, (all night)
All night, (all night)
(All night), (all night)
All night, (all night)
(All night), (all night)
All night, (all night, all night, all night)
All night, (all night, all night, all night, all night, all night, all night, all night, all night)
