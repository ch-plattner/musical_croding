
You broke my heart, tore it apart
Thought it was cute, thought it was smart
But now I'm back and I've got the strength of ten
So I got a message for you my friend

I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Daniel waitin' for that lion to come
Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Dum dum dee dum dum dee dee dum dum

That old lion's mean and long in the tooth
And like you, baby, he's out on the loose
Messin' hearts up time and time again
Now it's the time for that messin' to end

I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Daniel waitin' for that lion to come
Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Dum dum dee dum dum dee dee dum dum

At night I hear you out prowling around
Tearing guys up, scaring 'em down
Now all that growling's gonna come to no end
'Cause I'm just biding my time, my little friend

I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Daniel waitin' for that lion to come
Daniel waitin' in the lion's den
Dum dum dee dum dum dee dee dum dum
