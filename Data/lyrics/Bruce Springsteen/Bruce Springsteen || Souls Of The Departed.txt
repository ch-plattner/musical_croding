
On the road to Basra stood young Lieutenant Jimmy Bly 
Detailed to go through the clothes of the soldiers who died 
At night in dreams he sees their souls rise 
Like dark geese into the Oklahoma skies 

Well this is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted 
This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 

Now Raphael Rodriguez was just seven years old 
Shot down in a schoolyard by some East Compton Cholos 
His mama cried "My beautiful boy is dead" 
In the hills the self-made men just sighed and shook their heads 

This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted 
Young lives over before they got started 
This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 

Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed 
All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead 
I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down 
Right here on my own piece of dirty ground 

Now I ply my trade in the land of king dollar 
Where you get paid and your silence passes as honor 
And all the hatred and dirty little lies 
Been written off the books and into decent men's eyes
