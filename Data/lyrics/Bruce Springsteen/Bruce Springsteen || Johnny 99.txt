Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none 
He came home too drunk from mixin' 
Tanqueray and wine 
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call 'm Johnny 99 

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop 
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top 
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind 
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99 

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown 
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down 
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime 
Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99 

A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away 
His mama stood up and shouted "judge don't take my boy this way" 
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make 
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away 

Now judge I got debts no honest man could pay 
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away 
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man 
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand 

Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead 
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head 
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time 
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line
