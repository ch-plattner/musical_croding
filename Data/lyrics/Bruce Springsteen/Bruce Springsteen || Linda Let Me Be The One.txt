The midnight boys are outside
Scraping tears up off the street
Standin' guard beneath the window
Where only Linda sleeps
The leader is a kid named Eddie
Walkin' like an angel in defeat
He trashes her old man's car, slashes Linda's name in the seat
And calls out

Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one

In a room full of contenders
Eddie spars 'till he drops to his bed and surrenders
Draped in the scarves
He stole from Linda's bedroom
The night he layed at her feet
When the midnight boys were stranded
Down on Cason Street

Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one

In the basement of St. Mary's
Eddie hides from the rain
In with the stolen sisters 'til the streets are dry again
Talkin' fast cars and spare parts
Empty homes and broken hearts
Distant worlds with strange girls
And kneeling with Linda in the dark

Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
Linda will you let me be the one
