
There's a pillar in the temple 
where I carved your name 
There's a soul sitting sad and blue 
Now the remedies you've taken 
are all in vain 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 

Darling I can't stop the rain 
Or turn your black sky blue 
Well let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 

Well now our truth lay shattered, 
we stood at world's end 
There's a dead sun rose in view 
As if any of this matters, a kiss my friend 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 

Darling we can't stop this train 
When it comes crashing through 
But let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 

On the bench you lie all is nails and rust 
And the love you've given's turned ashes and dust 
When the hope you've gathered's drifted to the wind 
It's you and I now, friend (you and I now, friend) 
You and I now, friend 

Here our memory lay corrupted and our city lay dry 
Let me make this vow to you 
Here where it's blood for blood and an eye for an eye 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 

Here we bear the mark of Cain 
But let the light shine through 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do 
Let me show you what love can do
