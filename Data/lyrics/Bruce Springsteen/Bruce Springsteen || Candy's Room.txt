
In Candys room, there are pictures of her heroes on the wall, 
but to get to Candys room, you gotta walk the darkness of Candys hall, 
Strangers from the city, call my babys number and they bring her toys, 
When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I wanna be Candys boy, 
Theres a sadness hidden in that pretty face, a sadness all her own, from which no man can keep Candy safe. 

We kiss, my hearts pumpin to my brain 
the blood rushes in my veins, when I touch Candys lips, 
We go driving, driving deep into the night, 
I go driving deep into the light, in Candys eyes. 

She says, Baby if you wanna be wild, 
you got a lot to learn, close your eyes, 
Let them melt, let them fire, 
let them burn 
Cause in the darkness, therell be hidden worlds that shine, 
When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine, 
She has fancy clothes and diamond rings, 
She has men who give her anything she wants, but they dont see, 
That what she wants is me, 
Oh, and I want her so, 
Ill never let her go, no, no, no 
She knows that Id give 
all that I got to give, 
All that I want, all that I live, 
to make Candy mine 
Tonight
