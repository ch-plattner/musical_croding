
Put on your black dress baby, and put your hair up right
There's a party way down in Factory Town tonight
I'll be going down there if you need a ride
Come on, come on, let's go tonight

How many men fail, their dreams denied
They walk through these streets with death in their eyes
Now the man on the radio says "Elvis Presley died"
Come on, come on, let's go tonight

Well now some came to witness, now some came to weep
Drawn by death's strange glory, they stood in the street
Drawn together forever in the promise of an endless sleep
Come on, come on, let's go tonight
Baby, come on, come on, let's go tonight
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
