You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
And you try to see, girl
The way things were when we were at your place
In the days it was just you and me, girl
And you cry because things ain't like before
Well don't you know they can't be that way anymore
But don't worry baby

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'Cause this is the last dance, this is the last chance for hearts of stone
Hmmm

If there was something, baby, that I could do
Something that would last, honey, I would
But we all know, girl, especially you do
How you can't return to your past, no
So girl close your eyes and I'll be there
Hold me once more and we can go anywhere
Ah, we could babe

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
Just put your ear close to the phone
This is the last dance, the last chance for hearts of stone
Whoa well, Big Man

And you cry because things ain't like before
Well don't you know they can't be like that anymore
But don't worry baby
I know it baby

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
Baby this is the last chance, the last dance for hearts of stone
This is the last dance, the last chance for hearts of stone
Hmmmmm
