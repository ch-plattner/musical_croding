
The Skulls met the Pythons down at the First Street station
Alliances have been made in alleyways all across the nation
These boys live off the milk of a silver jet and the love of sweet young women
Now the Pythons are down from old Englishtown and they're looking to do some living
Well the leader of the Pythons is a kid they just call Zero
Now Terry's pop says these kids are some kind of monsters
But Terry says, "No, pop, they're just plain heroes"

Zero and Terry they found the love that burns like wildfire
Now Terry's daddy understood that this Zero was no good, a child, a thief and a liar
Well from out of the darkness that breaks the dawn Zero rode like twilight
He sayd, "Tonight's the night, blind Terry, come on," Terry come on, tonight is the night
Pack your bags baby

And together they ran like reindeers through the street
Well like tomorrow the earth was gonna catch up on fire
Now Terry's dad hired some troopers to kill Zero and bring Terry back home
They crawled up in the night like firelight

Now snow-white troopers from the council of crime rode silver foxes through Terry's field
Oh they met the Pythons down on Route 9 but they refused to yield
Yeah now the Pythons fought with buzz guns and the troopers with swords like light
And Zero and Terry they ran away as the gang fought all through the night

Well now some folks say Zero and Terry got away, others said they were caught and brought back
But still them young pilgrims to this day go to that spot way down by the railroad track
Where the troopers met the pythons, old timers cry on a hot August night
If you look hard enough, if you try, you'll catch Zero and Terry and all the Pythons
Oh just hiking the streets up in the sky
Oh just walking, just hiking the streets up in the sky
Just hiking the streets up in the sky
??? the streets in the sky
Just hiking the streets in the sky
Oh just hiking the streets
Hey Zero
