
Billy, he's down by the railroad tracks 
Sittin' low in the back seat of his Cadillac 
Diamond Jackie, she's so intact 
She falls so softly beneath him 
Jackie's heels are stacked, Billy's got cleats on his boots 
Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway and come back home with the loot 
It's midnight in Manhattan, this is no time to get cute 
It's a mad dog's promenade 
So walk tall, or baby, don't walk at all 

Fish lady, fish lady, fish lady, she baits them tenement walls 
She won't take corner boys, ain't got no money and they're so easy 
I said, "Hey baby, won't you take my hand, walk me down Broadway 
I'm a young man and I talk real loud, yeah baby, walk real proud for you 
So shake it away, so shake away your street life 
And hook up to the train 
Hook up to the night train 
Hook it up, hook up to the, hook up to the train" 
But I know that she won't take the train 
No, she won't take the train 
No, she won't take the train 
No, she won't take the train 
She's afraid them tracks are gonna slow her down 
And when she turns, this boy'll be gone 
So long, sometimes you just gotta walk on 

Hey vibes man, hey jazz man, play me your serenade 
Any deeper blue and you're playin' in your grave 
Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the blues boy 
Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the darlin' yearlin' sharp boy 
Straight for the church note ringin', vibes man sting a trash can 
Listen to your junk man 
Listen to your junk man 
Listen to your junk man 
Listen to your junk man 
He's singin', singin', singin', singin' 
All dressed up in satin, walkin' past the alley 
Watch out for your junk man 
Watch out for your junk man 
Watch out for your junk man
