I was standing by the river 
Where the cold black water runs 
I was standing by the river 
Where the cold black water runs 
I had my good eye to the dark 
And my blind eye to the sun 

I had all of the riches 
I had each and every one 
I had all of the riches 
I had each and every one 
I had my good eye to the dark 
And my blind eye to the sun 

Well I swore you were my darling 
Yeah, you were the only one 
Since I swore you were my darling 
You were the only one 
Had my good eye to the dark 
And my blind eye to the sun
