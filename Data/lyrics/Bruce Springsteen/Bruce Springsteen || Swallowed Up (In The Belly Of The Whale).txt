I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea
With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me
I come upon strange earth and a great black cave
I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave

We've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up

The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east
Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast
A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup
You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up

We've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up

We trusted our skills and our good sails
Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail

But we've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up

We've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up
