
Ever since you were a little girl
You set the rules in your little world
But girls grow up and throw their toys away
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play
(Girl we're living)
You dress them up the way you want to
(Girl we're living)
You make them do just what you want them to do
(Girl we're living)
Once I thought we had a love that was true
(Girl we're living, living, living, living)
But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you
We're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse
You may feel safe and sound
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down

It's all been neatly arranged in your mind
Every detail fits your own design
Every room is perfectly in place
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face
(Girl we're living)
You had a plan and darling like a child
(Girl we're living)
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style
(Girl we're living)
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild
(Girl we're living, living, living, living)
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size
We're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse
We may feel safe and sound
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down

Everything's as you dreamed it would be
But there's something wrong that you can't see
Room by room you're looking for some little flaw
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall
(Girl we're living)
Something, girl, that will explain away
(Girl we're living)
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play
(Girl we're living)
Your little dolls they got a grip on you
(Girl we're living)
Your little dolls they got a grip on you
(Girl we're living)
Your little dolls they got a grip on you
(Girl we're living, living, living, living)
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too
We're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse
We may feel safe and sound
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down
(We're living in a dollhouse)
And we're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse
Oh we're living in a dollhouse
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
We're living in a dollhouse
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, oh yeah
We're living in a dollhouse
