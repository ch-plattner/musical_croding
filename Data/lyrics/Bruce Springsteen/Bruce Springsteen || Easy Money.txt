
You put on your coat, I’ll put on my hat
You put out the dog, I’ll put out the cat
You put on your red dress for me tonight honey
We’re going on the town now
Looking for easy money

There’s nothing to it mister
You won’t hear a sound
When your whole world comes tumbling down
And all them fat cats, they’ll just think it’s funny
I’m goin’ on the town now, lookin’ for easy money

I got a Smith & Wesson 38
I got a hellfire burning and I got me a date
Got me a date on the far shore
Where it’s bright and sunny
I’m goin’ on the town tonight, lookin’ for easy money

You put on your coat, I’ll put on my hat
You put out the dog, I’ll put out the cat
You put on your red dress
You’re lookin’ real good honey
We’re going on the town now
Looking for easy money
We’re going on the town tonight
Looking for easy money
