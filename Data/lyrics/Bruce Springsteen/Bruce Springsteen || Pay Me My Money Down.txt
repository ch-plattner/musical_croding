I thought I heard the Captain say, 
Pay me my money down, 
Tomorrow is our sailing day, 
Pay me my money down 
Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

As soon as the boat was clear of the bar, 
Pay me my money down, 
The captain knocked me down with a spar, 
Pay me my money down 

Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

If I'd been a rich man's son, 
Pay me my money down, 
I'd sit on the river and watch it run, 
Pay me my money down 

Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

[trumpet]
well... 
I wish I was Mr Gates, 
Pay me my money down, 
They'd haul my money in in crates, 
Pay me my money down 

Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

Well 40 nights, nights at sea 
Pay me my money down, 
Captain worked every last dollar out of me, 
Pay me my money down 

Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

Oh pay me, oh pay me, 
Pay me my money down, 
Pay me or go to jail, 
Pay me my money down 

pay me my money down
pay me my money down
pay me my money down
