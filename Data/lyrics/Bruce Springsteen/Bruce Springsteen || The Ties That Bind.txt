
You been hurt and you're all cried out you say 
You walk down the street pushin' people outta your way 
You packed your bags and all alone you wanna ride, 
You don't want nothin', don't need no one by your side 
You're walkin' tough baby, but you're walkin' blind 
to the ties that bind 

The ties that bind 
Now you can't break the ties that bind 

Cheap romance, it's all just a crutch 
You don't want nothin' that anybody can touch 
You're so afraid of being somebody's fool 
Not walkin' tough baby, not walkin' cool 
You walk cool, but darlin', can you walk the line 
And face the ties that bind 
The ties that bind 
Now you can't break the ties that bind 

I would rather feel the hurt inside, yes I would darlin', 
Than know the emptiness your heart must hide, 
Yes I would darlin', yes I would darlin', 
Yes I would baby 

You sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain 
Who'll ease the sadness, who's gonna quiet the pain 
It's a long dark highway and a thin white line 
Connecting baby, your heart to mine 
We're runnin' now but darlin' we will stand in time 
To face the ties that bind 
The ties that bind 
Now you can't break the ties that bind 
You can't forsake the ties that bind
