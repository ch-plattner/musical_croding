
With you I don't hear the minutes ticking by 
I don't feel the hours as they fly 
I don't see the summer as it wanes 
Just a subtle change of light upon your face 

Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away 
This is our kingdom of days 

I watched the sun as it rises and sets 
I watched the moon trace its arc with no regret 
My jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves 
The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees 

Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away 
This is our kingdom of days 
This is our kingdom of days 

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do 
You whispered "then prove it, then prove it, then prove it, to me baby blue" 

When I count my blessings and you're mine for always 
We laughed beneath the covers 
and count the wrinkles and the grays 

Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away 
Sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away 
This is our kingdom of days 
This is our kingdom of days 
This is our kingdom of days 
This is our kingdom of days 
This is our kingdom of days
