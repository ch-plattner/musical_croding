
I went out walking the other day 
Seen a little girl crying along the way 
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again 
Someday your crying girl will end 
And you'll find once again 

Two hearts are better than one 
Two hearts girl get the job done 
Two hearts are better than one 

Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes 
But I was living in a world of childish dreams 
Someday these childish dreams must end 
To become a man and grow up to dream again 
Now I believe in the end 

Two hearts are better than one 
Two hearts girl get the job done 
Two hearts are better than one 

Sometimes it might seem like it was planned 
for you to roam empty hearted through this land 
Though the world turns you hard and cold 
There's one thing mister, that I know 
That's if you think your heart is stone 
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone 
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind 
That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one 

Two hearts are better than one 
Two hearts girl get the job done 
Two hearts are better than one
