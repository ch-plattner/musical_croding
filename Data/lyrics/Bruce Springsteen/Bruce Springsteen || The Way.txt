
The way your heart beats when I hold you tight
The way you sigh when we kiss goodnight
The way the wind blows through the trees
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me

The way you warm me baby when I'm cold
The way you make me want you body and soul
The way the rivers run to the sea
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me

The way you soothe me when I'm in pain
The way you make the blood rush in my veins
The way the winds rush through the trees
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me

When I lose faith you take my hand
The way you make me feel like I'm a man
The way the sun belongs to the sea
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me

[Sax Solo]

The way you make me feel like I belong
And if I could girl though I know it'd be wrong
I'd lock you deep inside 'till the last rains fall
And hide you from the emptiness of it all

Sometimes at night I lie awake
I pull you close and feel each breath you take
The way the rivers belong to the seas
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me
Well hey, that's the way you belong to me
Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm
