Now Old Dan Tuker was a fine old man 
Washed his face in a fryin' pan 
Combed his hair with a wagon wheel 
And died with a toothache in his heal 

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
Your're to late to get your supper 
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
You're to late to get your supper 

Now Old Dan Tucker come to town 
Ridin' a billy goat, leadin' a hound 
The hound dog barked and billy goat 
jumped 
And landed old Tucker on a stump 

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
Your're to late to get your supper 
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
You're to late to get your supper 

Now Old Dan Tuckergot drunk and fell 
In the fire and kicked up holy hell 
A red-hot coal got in his shoe 
An oh my Lord the ashes flew 

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
Your're to late to get your supper 
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
You're to late to get your supper

Swinging them ladies all round 
First to the right and then to the left 
Then to the gal that he loved best 

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
Your're to late to get your supper 
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
You're to late to get your supper 

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
Your're to late to get your supper 
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker 
You're to late to get your supper
