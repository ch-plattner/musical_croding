I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark 
I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart 
It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through 
And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you 

A friend of mine became a father last night 
When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light 
Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines 
And that great jukebox out on Route 39 
They say he travels fastest who travels alone 
But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home 

Is it the sound of the leaves 
Left blown by the wayside 
That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight 
Is it the cry of the river 
With the moonlight shining through 
That ain't what scares me baby 
What scares me is loosin' you 

They say if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed 
But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head 
And God's light came shinin' on through 
I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew 
It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me 
It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true 
It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms 
No no baby it was you 
So hold me close honey say you're forever mine 
And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine
