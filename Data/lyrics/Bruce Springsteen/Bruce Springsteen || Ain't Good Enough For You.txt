And you don't like, don't like the way I talk
You criticize about me endlessly
Logic defies how you get stuck with me
And you complain about the clothes I wear
And you explain there's other boys out there
You complain my car makes too much noise
And you cry I'm always out with the boys

Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you

You complain the way I love you at night
You explain I'm really not your type
If we go out, you say I'm such a bore
If we stay in, you say what are we living for
I don't understand, there's nothing I can do
There ain't no way I can satisfy you
End of the night I lean in for a kiss
Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss

Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you, hey!
Hey!
(Come on boys!)

Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you

I tried to change, I got a job in sales
I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales
And babe I tried to make the latest scene
Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine
I bought a record with all the latest grooves
A book of love with all the latest moves
I bought some flowers and I waited at your door
And you came out, didn't want to see me no more

Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Whoaaa!
