
Well surprise, surprise, surprise 
Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise 
Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down 

Well surprise, surprise, surprise 
Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise 
Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down 

Well today is your birthday 
We've traveled so far we two 
So let's blow out the candles on your cake 
And we'll raise a glass or two 
And when the sun comes out tomorrow 
It'll be the start of a brand new day 
And all that you have wished for I know will come your way 

Well surprise, surprise, surprise 
Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise 
Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down 

In the hollow of the evening, as you lay your head to rest 
May the evening stars scatter a shining crown upon your breast 
In the darkness of the morning, as the sky struggles to light 
May the rising sun caress and bless your soul throughout your life 

Well surprise, surprise, surprise 
Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise 
Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down 

Well surprise, surprise, surprise 
Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise 
Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down (let your love shine down) 
Let your love shine down (let your love shine down) 
Let your love shine down 

Surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes 
And let your love shine down
