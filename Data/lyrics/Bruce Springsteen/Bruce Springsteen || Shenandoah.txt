
The Missouri, she's a might river 
Away you rolling river 
The red man's camp lies on her borders 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

A white man loved an Indian maiden 
Away you rolling river 
With notions sweet his canoe was laden 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

O Shenandoah, I love your daughter 
Away you rolling river 
I'll take her 'cross the rolling water 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

The chief disdained the trader's dollars 
Away you rolling river 
My daughter never you shall follow 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

At last there came a Yankee skipper 
Away you rolling river 
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

He sold the chief that fire-water 
Away you rolling river 
And 'cross the river he stole his daughter 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri 

O Shenandoah, I long to hear you 
Away you rolling river 
Across the wide and rolling water 
Away, we're bound away across the wide 
Missouri
