
I met a little girl and I settled down 
In a little house out on the edge of town 
We got married, and swore we'd never part 
Then little by little we drifted from each other's hearts 

At first I thought it was just restlessness 
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep 
In the end it was something more I guess 
That tore us apart and made us weep 

And I'm driving a stolen car 
Down on Eldridge Avenue 
Each night I wait to get caught 
But I never do 

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote 
When our love was young and bold 
She said last night she read those letters 
And they made her feel one hundred years old 

And I'm driving a stolen car 
On a pitch black night 
And I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright 
But I ride by night and I travel in fear 
That in this darkness I will disappear
