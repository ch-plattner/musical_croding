Blowing down the (widened night[?])
I'm singing through these power lines
And I'm running on time and feeling alright
Skipping over the curves in the air
Reaching to see if you're out there
Coming across your radio station
Calling out nation to nation
If you can hear me then say alright
And if you can't, meet me in the city tonight

I was busted for feeling no pain
Charged with doing things I can't explain
Picked up for parole violation
Locked with the boys in the subway station
Handcuffed on the killing floor
Transmitting from behind these jailhouse doors
And if you're sick, if you're tired, if you're broken
Check the line, check the time, check the action, check the score
Come and get me if I ain't right, 
But if I am, meet me in the city tonight!

Everybody's lost in romance
Do you feel the way I feel ohhh
I'm just searching girl 
For the blood, for the bone, for the muscle, for what's real

I was busted for feeling no pain
Charged with doing things I can't explain
Picked up for parole violation
Locked with the boys in the subway station
I pushed my way through the heartened[?] crowd
I shoved my way through the heartened[?] crowd
Past the sign saying this is not allowed
The way someones standing straight
Shouting out loud

Handcuffed to the jailhouse door
Transmitting from the gallow floor
And if you're sick, if you're tired, if you're broken
Check the line, check the time, check the action, check the score
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright, and if you can't...

Meet me in the city tonight! [x3]

In the city, meet me in the city tonight! [x4]
