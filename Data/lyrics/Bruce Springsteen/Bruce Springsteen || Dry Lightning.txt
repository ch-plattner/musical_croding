
I threw my robe on in the morning 
Watched the ring on the stove turn red 
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee 
Pulled on my boots and made the bed 
Screen door hangin' off its hinges 
Kept bangin' me awake all night 
As I look out the window 
The only thing in sight 
Is dry lightning on the horizon line 
Just dry lightning and you on my mind. 

I chased the heat of her blood 
Like it was the holy grail 
Descend beautiful spirit 
Into the evening pale 
Her appaloosa's 
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain 
There's a low thunder rolling 
'Cross the mesquite plain 
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line 
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind 

I'd drive down to Alvarado Street 
Where she'd dance to make ends meet 
I'd spend the night over my gin 
As she'd talk to her men 

Well the piss yellow sun 
Comes bringin' up the day 
She said "Ain't nobody can give nobody 
What they really need anyway." 

Well you get so sick of the fightin' 
You lose your fear of the end 
But I can't lose your memory 
And the sweet smell of your skin 
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line 
Just dry lightning and you on my mind
