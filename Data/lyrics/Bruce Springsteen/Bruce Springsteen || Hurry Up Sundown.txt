It's the end of another working day
Come on and pack your blues away
Change your clothes, we'll go for a ride
To the other side

Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown

Over here it's easier to breathe
There's a place for you and me
And there's no devil here to pay
And come the light of day we pray

Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown

And together we'll ride the other side
We'll feel so free, just you and me
And I'll pray what is due
Till the night sees us through

And together we'll ride the other side
We'll feel so free, just you and me
When this long is day is through
We will dance in blue

Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown

It's the end of another working day
Come and pack your blues away
It's the end of another working day
Come on and pack your blues away
