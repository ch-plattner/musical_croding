
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
and strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
but there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Oh-oh, someday girl I don't know when 
we're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
and we'll walk in the sun 
But till then tramps like us 
baby we were born to run 

Oh honey, tramps like us
baby we were born to run 

Come on with me, tramps like us
baby we were born to run 

Ru-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Uh-uh-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-un
