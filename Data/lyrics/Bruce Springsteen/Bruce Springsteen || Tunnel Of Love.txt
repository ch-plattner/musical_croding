Fat man sitting on a little stool 
Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you 
Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck 
Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove 
We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love 

I can feel the soft silk of your blouse 
And them soft thrills in our little fun house 
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us 
You me and all that stuff we're so scared of 
Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love 

There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D 
I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me 
There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother 
It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love 

it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough 
Man meets woman and they fall in love 
But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough 
And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love
