
In the summer that I was baptized, 
My father held me to his side, 
As they put me to the water, 
He said how on that day I cried. 
We were prisoners of love, a love in chains, 
He was standin' in the door, I was standin' in the rain, 
with the same hot blood burning in our veins, 
Adam raised a Cain. 

All of the old faces, 
Ask you why you're back, 
They fit you with position, 
And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac, 
In the darkness of your room, 
Your mother calls you by your true name, 
You remember the faces, the places, the names, 
You know it's never over, it's relentless as the rain, 
Adam raised a Cain. 

In the Bible Cain slew Abel 
And East of Eden he was cast, 
You're born into this life paying, 
for the sins of somebody else's past, 
Daddy worked his whole life, for nothing but the pain, 
Now he walks these empty rooms, looking for something to blame, 
You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames, 
Adam raised a Cain. 

Lost but not forgotten, from the dark heart of a dream, 
Adam raised a Cain
