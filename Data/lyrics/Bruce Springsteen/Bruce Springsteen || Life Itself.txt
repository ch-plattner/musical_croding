
We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows 
There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow 
I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else 
You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself 

You were life itself, rushing over me 
Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
I can't make it without you 

I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell 
You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell 
You squandered all your riches, your, your beauty and your wealth 
Like you had no further use for, for life itself 

You were life itself, rushing over me 
Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
I can't make it without you 

Why are things that we treasure most slip away in time 
'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind 
Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart 

'Til we fall away in our own darkness 
Stranger to our own hearts 
And to life itself, rushing over me 
Life itself, the wind in the black elms 

Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
I can't make it without you 
So here's one for the road 
Here's one to your health 

And to life itself, rushing over me 
Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
I can't make it without you 

Life itself 
Life itself 
Life itself 
Life itself
