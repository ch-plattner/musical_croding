Miguel came from a small town in northen Mexico 
He came north with his brother Louis to California three years ago 
They crossed at the river levee when Louis was just sixteen 
And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin 

They left their homes and family 
Their father said "My sons one thing you will learn 
For everything the north gives it exacts a price in return." 
They worked side by side in the orchards 
From morning till the day was through 
Doing the work the hueros wouldn't do. 

Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands 
Well deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch 
There in a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine 
Miguel and Louis stood cooking methamphetamine. 

You could spend a year in the orchards 
Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift 
Working for the men from Sinaloa 
But if you slipped the hydriodic acid 
Could burn right through your skin 
They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert 
If you breathed those fumes in 

It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside 
When the shack exploded lighting up the valley night 
Miguel carried Louis' body over his shoulder down a swale 
To the creekside and there in the tall grass Louis Rosales died 

Miguel lifted Louis' body into his truck and then he drove 
To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove 
There in the dirt he dug up ten thousand dollars all that they'd saved 
Kissed his brother's lips and placed him in his grave
