I walk along the levee to see the gypsy man
The dirt 'neath my feet, baby, 's turnin' to quicksand
He looked into my palm, then looked me in the eye
Told me you were gone, gone over the rise

Once we stood together at the wishing well
Our wishes like dreams, baby, into the water fell
Oh then I kissed your lips, but when I looked into your eyes
They were gone, gone over the rise

Tonight the blackbirds fly low on the water's edge
Oh we walked this path not knowing where it led
Now at the bottom of the river deep lies something shiny and golden
Is a promise that love couldn't keep same as a promise broken

Well I woke last night to the sound of rain
The wind rustling branches against the window pane
I searched the pillow beside me for the tears we cried
Baby they were gone, gone over the rise
