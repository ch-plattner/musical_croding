
I'm driving in my car 
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you close 
You just say no
You say you don't like it 
But girl I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss 
Ooooh, Fire

Late at night 
I'm takin' you home
I say I wanna stay 
You say you wanna be alone
You say you don't love me 
Girl you can't hide your desire
'Cause when we kiss 
Oh, Fire
Fire

You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight 
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin' 
Actin' like a fool
Well your kisses they burn 
But your heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet 
Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet 
Their love they didn't deny
Your words say split 
But your words they lie
'Cause when we kiss 
Mmmmmm, Fire
Fire

Burnin in my soul
It's outta control
