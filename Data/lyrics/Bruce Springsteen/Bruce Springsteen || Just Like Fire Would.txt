
One night in a motel room
Eyes cast like steel
I drank the wine that they left on my table
I knew the morning was too far

I smoked my last cigarette
I stay only to defy
The night was dark and the land was cold
It's frozen right to the bone

Just like fire would, I burn up
Just like fire would
Just like fire would, I burn up

500 miles I've gone today
Tomorrow's 500 more
Outside my window the world passes by, it's
Stranger than a dream

Just like fire would, I burn
Just like fire would
Just like fire would, I burn up

I go to work and I earn my pay, Lord
My sweat it falls to the ground
I see you now but we may never meet again child
The ice is hanging on the door

One night in a motel room
Eyes cast like steel
I drank the wine that they left on my table
I knew the morning was too far

Just like fire would, I burn up
Just like fire would
Just like fire would, I burn up

Just like fire would, I burn
Just like fire would
Just like fire would, I burn up
