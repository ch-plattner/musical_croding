Yesterday I went shopping buddy down to the mall 
Looking for something pretty I could hang on my wall 
I knocked over a lamp before it hit the floor I caught it 
A salesman turned around said, "boy, you break that thing you bought it". 

You can look but you better not touch boy 
You can look but you better not touch boy 
Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch 

Well I came home from work and I switched on Channel 5 
There was a pretty little girly lookin' straight into my eyes 
Well I watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen 
She didn't get me excited she just made me feel mean 

You can look but you better not touch boy 
You can look but you better not touch boy 
Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch 

Well I called up Dirty Annie on the telephone 
I took her out to the drive-in just to get her alone 
I found a lover's rendezvous, the music low, set to park 
I heard a tappin' on the window and a voice in the dark 

You can look but you better not touch boy 
You can look but you better not touch boy 
Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch
