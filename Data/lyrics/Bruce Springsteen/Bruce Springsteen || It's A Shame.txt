
Well I walk the way you want me to
And I'll talk the way you want me to
And I've tried to do all I can just to please you

Well I work hard every day for you
And I brought home all my pay for you
And I've cried my tears through the rain night and again

And oh whoa girl, it's a shame
Oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame
We worked so hard, but it's all in vain
Oh whoa girl, it's a shame

Now I bought your gold and diamond rings
And I brought you home your pretty things
And I thought I'd shown all the love I had for you, yes I did

But as hard as I try it all falls through
Well maybe I was born to be just your fool
Trying to satisfy your every desire, each need you require

Well oh whoa girl, it's a shame
Oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame
I worked so hard, but it's all in vain
Oh whoa girl, it's a shame

Someone now!
Whoa!
Whoaaa, whoa-hoo
Whoa

Oh whoa girl, it's a shame
Oh girl, it's a doggone shame
We worked so hard, but it's all in vain
Oh whoa girl, it's a shame
Oh whoa girl, it's a shame
Oh girl, it's a doggone shame
I worked so hard, but it's all in vain
Oh whoa, girl it's a shame
