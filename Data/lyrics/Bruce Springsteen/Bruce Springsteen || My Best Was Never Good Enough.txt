She said "Now don't stay nothin' 
If you don't have something nice to say 
The tough now they get going when the going gets tough." 
But for you my best was never good enough 

"Now don't try for a home run baby 
If you can get the job done with a hit 
Remember a quitter never wins 
And a winner never quits 
The sun don't shine on a sleepin' dog's ass." 
And all the rest of that stuff 
But for you my best was never good enough 

"If God gives you nothin' but lemons then you make some lemonade 
The early bird catches the fuckin' worm, Rome wasn't built in a day 
Now life's like a box of chocolates 
You never know what you're going to get 
Stupid is as stupid does" and all the rest of that shit 
Come on pretty baby call my bluff 
'Cause for you my best was never good enough
