
Well a great black river a man had found 
So he put all his money in a hole in the ground 
And sent a big steel arm drivin' down down down 
Man now I live on the streets of Houston town 

Packed up my wife and kids when winter came along 
And we headed down south with just spit and a song 
But they said "Sorry son it's gone gone gone" 

Well there's men hunkered down by the railroad tracks 
The Elkhorn Special blowin' my hair back 
Tents pitched on the highway in the dirty moonlight 
And I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight 

Parked in the lumberyard freezin' our asses off 
My kids in the back seat got a graveyard cough 
Well I'm sleepin' up in front with my wife 
Billy club tappin' on the windshield in the middle of the night 
Says "Move along man move along" 

Well big limousine long shiny and black 
You don't look ahead you don't look back 
How many times can you get up after you've been hit ? 
Well I swear if I could spare the spit 
I'd lay one on your shiny chrome 
And send you on your way back home 
So if you're gonna leave your town where the north wind blow 
To go on down where that sweet soda river flow 
Well you better think twice on it Jack 
You're better off buyin' a shotgun dead off the rack 
You ain't gonna find nothin' down here friend 
Except seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind 
Movin' on movin' on it's gone gone all gone
