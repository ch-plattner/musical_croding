
Well, hey there mister, can you tell me what happened to the seeds I've sown
Can you give me a reason, sir, as to why they never grown
They just blown around from town to town back out on to these fields
Where they fall from, from my hand back into the dirt of this hard land
Come on!

Well, me and my sister from Germantown, yeah, we did ride
And we made our beds, sir, from the rock on the mountain side
We've been blowing around from town to town looking for a place to land
Where the sun could break through the clouds and fall like a circle, like a circle of fire down on this hard land

Well, now even the rain it don't come around, don't come around here no more
And the only sound at night's the wind slamming that back porch door
Yeah, it stirs you up like it wants to just blow you down, twisting and churning up the sand
Leaving all them scarecrows lying face down into the dirt of this hard land

Well, from a building up on the hill I hear a tape deck blasting "Home On The Range"
And I can hear them bar rim choppers sweeping low across the plains
It's me and you Frank, we're looking for lost cattle, our hooves twisting and churning up the sand
Yeah, we're riding in the whirlwind, searching for a treasure way down south of the Rio Grande
We're riding cross that river in the moonlight way up onto the banks of this hard land

Well, hey Frank, won't you pack your bags and meet me tonight down at Liberty Hall
Ah, just one kiss from you my brother and we'll ride until we fall
We'll sleep out in the fields, we'll sleep by the rivers, and in the morning we'll make a plan
Well, if you can't make it, stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive if you can and meet me in a dream of this hard land
Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!
