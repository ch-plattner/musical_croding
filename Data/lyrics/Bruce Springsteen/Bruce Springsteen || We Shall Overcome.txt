We shall overcome 
We shall overcome 
We shall overcome some day 

Darling, here in my heart 
I do believe 
We shall overcome some day 

We'll walk hand in hand 
We'll walk hand in hand 
We'll walk hand in hand some day 

Darling, here in my heart 
I do believe 
We'll walk hand in hand some day 

Here we are not afraid 
We are not afraid 
We shall overcome some day 

Darling, here in my heart 
I do believe 
We shall overcome some day 

Darling, here in my heart 
I do believe 
We shall overcome some day 

Here we shall overcome some day
