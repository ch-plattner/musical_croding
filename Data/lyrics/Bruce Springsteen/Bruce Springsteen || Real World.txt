Mister trouble come walkin' this way 
Year gone past feels like one long day 
But I'm alive and I'm feelin' all right 
Well I run that hard road outta hearbreak city 
Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self-pity 
It was all wrong well now I'm movin' on 

Ain't no chuch bells ringing 
Ain't no flags unfurled 
Just me and you and the love we're bringing 
Into the real world 
Into the real world 

I built a shrine in my heart it wasn't pretty to see 
Made out of fool's gold memory and tears cried 
Now I'm headin' over the rise 
I'm searchin' for one clear moment of love and truth 
I still got a little faith 
But what I need is some proof tonight 
I'm lookin' for it in your eyes 

Ain't no chuch bells ringing 
Ain't no flags unfurled 
Just me and you and the faith we're bringing 
Into the real world 
Into the real world 

Well tonight I just wanna shout 
I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin' 
Into this black river of doubt 
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside 
And when the morning comes baby I don't wanna hide 
I'll stand right at your side with my arms open wide 

Well tonight I just wanna shout 
I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin' 
Into this black river of doubt 
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside 
'Til the morning comes 
I'll stand right by your side 

I wanna find some answers I wanna ask for some help 
I'm tired or runnin' scared 
Baby let's get our bags packed 
We'll take it here to hell and heaven and back 
And if love is hopeless hopeless at best 
Come on put on your party dress it's ours tonight 
And we're goin' with the tumblin' dice 

Ain't no chuch bells ringing 
Ain't no flags unfurled 
Oh just me you and the hope we're bringing 
Into the real world 
Well into the real world 
Oh into the real world
