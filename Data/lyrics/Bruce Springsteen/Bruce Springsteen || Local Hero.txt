
I was driving through my hometown 
I was just kinda killin' time 
When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting 
From the window of the five and dime 
I couldn't quite recall the name 
But the pose looked familiar to me 
So I asked the salesgirl "Who was that man 
Between the doberman and Bruce Lee ?" 
She said "Just a local hero" 
"Local hero" she said with a smile 
"Yeah a local hero he used to live here for a while" 

I met a stranger dressed in black 
At the train station 
He said "Son your soul can be saved" 
There's beautiful women nights of low livin' 
And some dangerous money to be made 
There's a big town 'cross the whiskey line 
And if we turn the right cards up 
They make us boss the devil pays off 
And them folks that are real hard up 
They get their local hero 
Somebody with the right style 
They get their local hero 
Somebody with just the right smile 

Well I learned my job I learned it well 
Fit myself with religion and a story to tell 
First they made me the king then they made me pope 
Then they brought the rope 

I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' "Drink this" 
Well my hands had lost all sensation 
These days I'm feeling all right 
'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation 
From the tainted chalice 
Well I drunk some heady wine 
Tonight I'm layin' here 
But there's something in my ear 
Sayin' there's a little town just beaneath the floodline 
Needs a local hero 
Somebody with the right style 
Lookin' for a local hero 
Someone with the right smile 
Local hero local hero she said with a smile 
Local hero he used to live here for a while
