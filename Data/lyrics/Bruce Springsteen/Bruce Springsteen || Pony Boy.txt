Pony boy pony boy 
Won't you be my pony boy 
Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up whoa 
My pony boy 

Ride with me ride with me 
Won't you take a ride with me 
Underneath the starry sky 
My pony boy 

O'er the hills and through the trees 
We'll go ridin' you and me 
Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-away 
My pony boy 

Down into the valley deep 
'Neath the eaves we will sleep 
Sky of dreams up above 
My pony boy
