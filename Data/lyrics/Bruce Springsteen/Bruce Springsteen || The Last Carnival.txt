
Sundown, sundown 
They're taking all the tents down. 
Where have you gone my handsome Billy? 

Sundown, sundown 
The carnival train's leaving town. 
Where are ya now my darlin' Billy? 

We won't be dancing together on the high wire 
Facing the lines with you at my side, oh no. 
We won't be breathing the smoke in the fire 
On a midway. 
Hanging from the trapeze, my wrists waiting for your wrists. 
Two daredevils high upon the water's edge. 
You throwing the knife that lands inches from my head. 
Sundown. 

Moon rise, moon rise, the light that was in your eyes is gone away. 
Daybreak, daybreak, the thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay 
We'll be riding the train without you tonight 
The train that keeps on moving 
It's black smoke scorching the evening sky. 
A million stars shining above us like every soul living and dead 
Has been gathered together by God to sing a hymn 
Over the old bones. 

Sundown, sundown. 
They empty out the fairgrounds. 
Where are you now my handsome Billy?
