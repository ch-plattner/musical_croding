
A bang then stardust in your eyes 
A billion years for just this night 
In a way it will be alright 

A blackness then the light of a million stars 
As you slip into in my car 
The evening sky strikes sparks 

This life, this life and then the next 
With you I have been blessed 
What more can you expect 

At night at my telescope alone 
This emptiness I've roamed 
Searching for a home 

The stars, a brief string of shining charms 
Rushing in right out of our arms 
Into the drifting dark 

This life, this life and then the next 
With you I have been blessed 
What more can you expect 

This life, this life and then the next 
I finger the hem of your dress 
My universe at rest 

We reach for starlight all night long 
But gravity is too strong 
Chained to this earth we go on and on and on and on and on 

Then a million sighs cresting were you stood 
A beauty in the neighborhood 
This lonely planet never looked so good 

This life, this life and then the next 
With you I have been blessed 
What more can you expect 

This life, this life and then the next 
I finger the hem of your dress 
My universe at rest
