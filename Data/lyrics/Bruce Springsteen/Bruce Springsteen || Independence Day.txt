
Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late 
Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now 
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate 
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow 
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us 
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too 
But they can't touch me now 
And you can't touch me now 
They ain't gonna do to me 
What I watched them do to you 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day 
All down the line 
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day this time 

Now I don't know what it always was with us 
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines 
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us 
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind 

Well say goodbye it's Independence Day 
It's Independence Day all boys must run away 
So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
All men must make their way come Independence Day 

Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint 
And the highway she's deserted clear down to Breaker's Point 
There's a lot of people leaving town now 
leaving their friends, their homes 
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone 

Well Papa go to bed now, it's getting late 
Nothing we can say can change anything now 
Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways 
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away 

So say goodbye it's Independence Day 
Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say 
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day 
I swear I never meant to take those things away
