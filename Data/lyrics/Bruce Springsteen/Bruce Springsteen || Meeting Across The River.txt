
Hey, Eddie, can you lend me a few bucks 
And tonight can you get us a ride 
Gotta make it through the tunnel 
Got a meeting with a man on the other side 

Hey Eddie, this guy, he's the real thing 
So if you want to come along 
You gotta promise you won't say anything 
'Cause this guy don't dance 
And the word's been passed this is our last chance 

We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie 
'Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line 
And if we blow this one 
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time 

And all we gotta do is hold up our end 
Here stuff this in your pocket 
It'll look like you're carrying a friend 
And remember, just don't smile 
Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style 

Well Cherry says she's gonna walk 
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it 
But Eddie, man, she don't understand 
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket 

And tonight's gonna be everything that I said 
And when I walk through that door 
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed 
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking 
Then I'm gonna go out walking 

Hey Eddie, can you catch us a ride ?
