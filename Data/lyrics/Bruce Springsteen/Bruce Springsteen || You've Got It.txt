No one ever found it
Ain’t no school ever taught it
No one ever made it
Ain’t no one ever bought it

But baby, you’ve got it
Baby, you’ve got it
C’mon and give it to me

Ain’t no one can break it
Ain’t no one can steal it
Ain’t no one can fake it
You just know it when you feel it

And baby, you’ve got it
Baby, you’ve got it
C’mon and give it to me

You can’t read it in a book
You can’t even dream it
Honey, it ain’t got a name
You just know it when you see it

Baby, you’ve got it
Baby, you’ve got it
C’mon and give it to me

Well, now, listen up my reckless love
It’s precious so don’t waste it
Can’t tell you what God made it of
But I know it when I taste it

Baby you’ve got it
Baby you’ve got it

You got it in your bones and blood
Yeah, you’re realer than real ever was

Baby, you’ve got it
Baby, you’ve got it
C’mon and give it to me
