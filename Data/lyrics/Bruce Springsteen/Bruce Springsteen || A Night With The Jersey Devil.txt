
Hear me now! 
I was born 13th child, 'neath the 13th moon 
Spit out all hungry and born anew 

Daddy drag me to the river tie me in rocks 
Throw me in where it's deep and wide 
I go down, I don't die 
Hole in the river bottom, I crawl through 

Come back kill six brothers and sisters, kill papa too 
Sway down Mama, sway down low 
They gonna know me wherever I go 

Into my bed with her kerosene my mama creep 
Set my flesh to burning, whilst I sleep 

I burn, burn, burn, till my soul burn black 
Black rains fall, I come back, I come back 
Get down Mama, get down low 
They gonna know me wherever I go 

16 witches, cast 16 spells 
Make me a guitar outta skin and human skull 
Sing you a song like the wind in the sandy loam 
Bring you baby out your happy home 

Ram's head, forked tail, clove hoof, love's my trail 
I sup on your body, sip on your blood like wine 
Out world theirs, this world mine 

So kiss me baby till it hurts 
God lost in heaven, we lost on earth 
Sway down Mama, sway down low 
They gonna know me wherever I go 
Wherever I go, wherever I go 

Well I got a brand new lover 
I love her yes I do, 
She's my one and only and her name is Baby Blue..
