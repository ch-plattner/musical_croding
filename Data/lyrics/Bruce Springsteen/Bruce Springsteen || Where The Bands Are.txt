
I hear the guitars ringin' out
Ringin' out down Union Street
I hear the lead singer shoutin' out, girl
Now I wanna be a slave to the beat
Yeah, tonight I wanna break my chains
Somebody break my heart
Somebody shake my brains
Downtown there's something that I wanna hear
There's a sound, little girl, keeps ringing in my ear

I wanna be where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
Where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)

I get off from work and I grab something to eat
I turn the corner and I drive down your street
Little gray houses darling looks like nowhere
But hey I know you're hiding in there
Come on out for just a little while
You know that heart of stone, girl, it just ain't your style
Tonight I wanna feel the beat of the crowd
And when I tell you that I love you
(Tell you that I love you)
I wanna have to shout it out loud
(Shout it out loud)
Shout it out loud

I wanna be where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
Where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
I wanna be where the bands are

I hear the guitars ringin' out again
Ringin' on down Union Street
I hear the lead singer shoutin' out girl
I wanna be a slave to the beat
And I want something that'll break my chains
Something to break my heart
Something to shake my brains
There's a rocker's special on tonight
So meet me on down
(Meet me on down)
'Neath the neon lights

I wanna be where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
Where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
Where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
Where the bands are
I wanna be where the bands are
(Where the bands are)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be where the bands are
(I wanna be)
(yeah I wanna be)
(yeah I wanna be)
(yeah I wanna be) where the bands are
(yeah I wanna be)
(yeah I wanna be)
(yeah) I wanna be
(yeah) I wanna be
I wanna be where the bands are
