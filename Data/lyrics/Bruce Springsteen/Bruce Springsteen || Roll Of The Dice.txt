
Well I've been a losin' gambler 
Just throwin' snake eyes 
Love ain't got me downhearted 
I know up around the corner lies 
My fool's paradise 
In just another roll of the dice 

All my elevens and sevens been comin' up 
Sixes and nines 
But since I fell for you baby 
Been comin' on changin' times 
They're waitin' over the rise 
Just another roll of the dice 

I've stumbled and I know I made my mistakes 
But tonight I'm gonna be playin' for all of the stakes 

Well it's never too late so come on girl 
The tables are waiting 
You and me and lady luck well tonight 
We'll be celebrating 
Drinkin' champagne on ice 
In just another roll of the dice 

High-rollers lay down your bets and I'll raise 'em 
Well I know the odds ain't in my favor 

Maybe I'm just a clown throwin' down 
Lookin' to come up busted 
I'm a thief in the house of love 
And I can't be trusted 
Well I'll be makin' my heist 
In just another roll of the dice 
Just another roll of the dice 
Move on up 
Come on seven 
Roll me baby 
In this fool's heaven
