
I got a dollar in my pocket 
There ain't a cloud up above 
I got a picture in a locket 
That says baby I love you 
Well if you didn't look then boys 
Then fellas don't go lookin' now 
Well here she comes a-walkin' 
All that heaven will allow 

Say hey there mister bouncer 
Now all I wanna do is dance 
But I swear I left my wallet 
Back home in my workin' pants 
C'mon Slim slip me in man 
I'll make it up to you somehow 
I can't be late I got a date 
With all that heaven will allow 

Rain and storm and dark skies 
Well now they don't mean a thing 
If you got a girl that loves you 
And who wants to wear your ring 
So c'mon mister trouble 
We'll make it through you somehow 
We'll fill this house with all the love 
All that heaven will allow 

Now some may wanna die young man 
Young and gloriously 
Get it straight now mister 
Hey buddy that ain't me 
'Cause I got something on my mind 
That sets me straight and walkin' proud 
And I want all the time 
All that heaven will allow
