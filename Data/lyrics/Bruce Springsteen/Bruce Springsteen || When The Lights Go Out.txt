You trust him with your money, you trust him with your kids
You'd even trust him with your wife
You better watch what's goin' on when the lights are out
When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around
Yeah when the lights are out, down in this dirty little town

Well now the world is dark and funny, better listen up to what I say
You ain't gonna know what's going on by what you see in the light of day
You gotta watch what's goin' on when the lights are out
When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around
Yeah when the lights are out in this dirty little town

Now you swear that she trusted you
Within reason I understand
But you kept slippin' in late at night
And in the mornin' you had that smell on your hands

Well now the world is turning, Rome is burning
Me, I'm watching and I'm learning
They say sure as God's hand and the tickin' of the clock
The lord's light'll shine under every slimy rock
Well last night I slept the sleep of fear
And I heard God's voice whisper in my ear
He said you better watch what's going on when the lights are out
When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around
Yeah when the lights are out, down in this dirty little town
Down in this dirty little town

Whooo
