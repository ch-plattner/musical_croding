
I don't remember how I felt
I never thought I'd live
To read about myself
In my hometown paper
How my brave young life
Was forever changed
In a misty cloud of pink vapor

Darlin' give me your kiss
Only understand
I am the nothing man

Around here everybody acts the same
Around here everybody acts like nothing's changed
Friday night club meets at Al's Barbecue
The sky is still the same unbelievable blue

Darlin' give me your kiss
Come and take my hand
I am the nothing man

You can call me Joe
Buy me a drink and shake my hand
You want courage
I'll show you courage you can understand
Pearl and silver
Restin' on my night table
It's just me Lord, pray I'm able

Darlin' with this kiss
Say you understand
I am the nothing man
I am the nothing man
