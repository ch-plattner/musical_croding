All that you'll never, ever, ever had
I know you've never had it
Ohh honey, don't you just sit there cryin'
Don't you sit there feelin' bad
No, no, no

You better get up
Now don't you understand?
And raise your hand
Hey, hey, hey
I said raise your hand

You know I'm stayin' above, yes I am
Want to give you all my love, ohh I do
Ohh honey, won't you come on and open up?
I said open up little heart
Please, won't you let me try? Yea

Got to be good
Don't you understand?
Raise your hand
Hey, hey, hey
I said raise your hand
Right here, right now, babe

Woh, yea
  (Yea)
Woh, aaa, aaa, aaa

Raise your hand
Raise your hand
Raise your hand
Raise your hand
Raise, eee
Ohh raise, eee
Ohh raise, eee
Ohh raise, eee
Said, raise your hand, come on
Raise your hand, feel
Raise your hand, and I gonna come in
Raise your hand
Raise your hand, yea
Raise your hand, yea
Raise it up, on up to me, come on
Raise it up, on up to me now
Raise it up, on up to me, yea
Yea
