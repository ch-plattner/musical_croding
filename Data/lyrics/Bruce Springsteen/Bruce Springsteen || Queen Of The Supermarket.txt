There's a wonderful world where all you desire 
And everything you've longed for is at your fingertips 
Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips 
Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you 
And the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air 
At the end of each working day she's waiting there 

I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
As the evening sky turns blue 
A dream awaits in aisle number two 

With my shopping cart I move through the heart 
Of a sea of fools so blissfully unaware 
That they're in the presence of something wonderful and rare 
The way she moves behind the counter 
Beneath her white apron her secret remains hers 
As she bags the groceries her eyes so bored 
And sure she's unobserved 

I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
There's nothing I can say 
Each night I take my groceries and I drift away 
And I drift away 

Guidance from the gods above 
At night I pray for the strength to tell her 
When I love I love I love I love her so 
Take my place in the check-out line 
For one moment her eyes meet mine 
I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up 

I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
Though her company cap covers her hair 
Nothing can hide the beauty waiting there 
The beauty waiting there 

I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 

As I lift my groceries in to my car 
I turn back for a moment and catch a smile 
That blows this whole fucking place apart 

I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket 
I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket
