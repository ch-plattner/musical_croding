Monday mornin' runs to Sunday night
A scream slow me down before the new year dies
Won't take much to kill a lovin' smile
And every mother with a baby cryin' in her arms, singin'
Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes

Yeah comin' from the city, comin' from the wild
I see a breathless army breakin' like a cloud
They're gonna smother love, they're gonna shoot your hopes
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves
Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes
Yeah, I got high hopes
Roy!
Got high hopes
Yeah, I got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes

Yeah so tell me someone now, what's the price
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life
I wanna have a wife, I wanna have some kids
I wanna look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance

Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
High hopes
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
Yeah, I got high hopes
Break!
High hopes
I got high hopes
Yeah, I got high hopes
I got high hopes
Yiiii, (I got) high hopes
Yeah, high hopes
Whoa, high hopes
High hopes
Yeah, well, I got high hopes
Yiiii, got high hopes
Yeah, high hopes
Yeah, (I got) high hopes
Yeah, high hopes
Yeah, I got high hopes
High hopes
