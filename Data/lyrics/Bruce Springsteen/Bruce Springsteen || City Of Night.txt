Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, at the light
Won't you take me on a ride through this city of night
I got some money and I'm feeling fine
I ain't in no hurry so just take your time
Some people wanna die young and gloriously
But Taxi Cab driver, well that ain't me
I got a cute little baby down at 12th and Vine
And she opens for business just about closing time
Ah hey hey, ah hey hey
City of night, city of night

And I don't believe what I see in this street
I don't know how people they can take the heat
Well baby I'm a liar, I'm a cheat, and I don't care
I got my money, I can take my fare
Ah hey hey, ah hey hey
City of night, city of night

I'm riding tonight to see my sugar girl
You know she wears that dress without a care in the world
Yeah she got come loving that's as bright as the sun
And she brings it with her man when she comes
Hey, hey, city of night
Ah-hey, ah-hey, city of night
Ride on
