
One, two, three, four!

Cold rain runnin' down the front of my shirt
I'm flat on my back, wheels in the dirt
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak, the deck's stacked
So put your foot to the floor and darlin' don't look back

We're makin' night tracks through the blazin' rain
Blowin' pistons workin' the fast lane
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash
There's nothing to lose, it's a bad break but baby we're backed
Tonight we'll blow off their doors and honey we won't look back

We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain
We made it through the heart of a hurricane
We tore it apart and put it together again
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoaaa

Well angel, won't you believe in love for me
Come on and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street
We'll move with the city in the dark
You gotta walk it, talk it, in your heart
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartache, the deck's stacked
So put your foot to the floor, darlin'
Tonight we'll blow off their doors, baby
We're gonna even the score, and honey we won't look back

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Ah don't look back
Ah baby don't look back, ah
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Ah baby don't look back
No no no no no
Ah baby don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look
Back
