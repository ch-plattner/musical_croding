
In the room where fortune falls 
On a day when chance is all 
In the dark of fierce exile 
I felt the grace of your smile 

Honey, you're my lucky day 
Baby, you're my lucky day 
Well I lost all the other bets I made 
Honey, you're my lucky day 

When I see strong hearts give way 
To the burdens of the day 
To the weary hands of time 
Where fortune is not kind 

Honey, you're my lucky day 
Baby, you're my lucky day 
Well I lost all the other bets I made 
Honey, you're my lucky day 

Whoa! 

[guitar solo] 
[sax solo] 

I've waited at your side 
I've carried the tears you've cried 
But to win, darlin' we must play 
So don't hide your heart away 

Honey, you're my lucky day 
Baby, you're my lucky day 
Well I lost all the other bets I made 
Honey, you're my lucky day 

Whoa!
