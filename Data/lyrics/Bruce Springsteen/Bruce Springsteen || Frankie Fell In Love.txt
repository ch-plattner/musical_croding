
Good morning, good morning
The church mouse is snoring
News is out all over town
Frankie fell in Love

Wake up, boys, wake up
You drunken choir boys shake it up
Our Juliet says her Romeo's been found
Frankie fell in Love

World peace's gonna break out
From here on in we're eating take out
She ain't gonna be cooking for the likes of us
Somebody call mama and just tell her
Frankie fell in Love

Einstein and Shakespeare
Sitting having a beer
Einstein trying to figure out the number that adds up to this
Shakespeare said, "Man it all starts with a kiss"

Einstein is scratching
Numbers on his napkin
Shakespeare said, "Man, it's just one and one make three
Ah, that's why it's poetry"

World peace's gonna break out
From here on in we're eating take out
She ain't gonna be cooking for the likes of us
Somebody call mama and just tell her
Frankie fell in Love

Glory, glory, it's the same old story
Kid, there ain't nothing anybody can do
It's gonna happen to you just like
Frankie fell in Love

Good evening, good evening
The church mouse is sleeping
News is out all over town
Frankie fell in Love
