It's over now, the thing we had
I ain't sorry, babe, I just feel mad
You walk real pretty and you talk real fine
Night after night you wrote the lines

My life's the same story
Again and again
I' m on the outside looking in
On the outside looking in

Hey, make-believe ain't real
I don't doubt the way I feel
You walk real pretty and you talk real sweet
Well babe I was born in the driving seat

My life's the same story
Again and again
I'm on the outside looking in

On the outside looking in
Yes I'm on the outside looking in

It's over now, the thing we had
I ain't sorry, babe, I just feel mad
You walk real pretty and you talk real fine
Night after night you wrote the lines

My life's the same story
Beginning to end
Beginning to end
I' m on the outside looking in
On the outside looking in
Yes I'm on the outside looking in
Yes I am
Yes I guess I am
Baby I'm on the outside looking in
