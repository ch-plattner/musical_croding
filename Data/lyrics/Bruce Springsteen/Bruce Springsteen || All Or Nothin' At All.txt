
Said youd give me just a little kiss 
And youd rock me for a little while 
Well youd slip me just a piece of it 
Listen up little child 
I want it all or nothin at all 
I want it all or nothin at all 

Said youd take me for a little dance 
If you had a little time on your hands 
Well all I do is push and shove 
Just to get a little piece of your love 
I want it all or nothin at all 
I want it all or nothin at all 

Well now I dont wanna be greedy 
But when it comes to love there aint no doubt 
You just aint gonna get what you want 
With one foot in bed and one foot out 
You got to give it all or nothin at all 
All or nothin at all 

Now I only got a little time 
So if youre gonna change your mind 
Then shout out what youre thinkin of 
If what youre thinkin of is love 
I want it all or nothin at all 
I want it all or nothin at all 
I want to have it all or nothin at all 
I want it all or nothin at all 

I want it all or nothin at all 
I want to give it all or nothin at all
