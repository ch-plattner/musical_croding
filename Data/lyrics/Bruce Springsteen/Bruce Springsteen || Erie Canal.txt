
I've got a mule and her name is Sal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 
She's a good old worker and a good old pal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 

We haul'd some barges in our day 
Filled with lumber, coal, and hay 
We know every inch of the way 
From Albany to Buffalo 

Low bridge, everybody down 
Low bridge, yeah we're coming to a town 
And you'll always know your neighbor 
And you'll always know your pal 
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal 

We'd better look around for a job, old gal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 
You can bet your life I'll never part with Sal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 

Get up mule, here comes a lock 
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock 
One more trip and back we'll go 
Right back home to Buffalo 

Low bridge, everybody down 
Low bridge, we're coming to a town 
You'll always know your neighbor 
And you'll always know your pal 
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal 

Where would I be if I lost my pal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 
I'd like to see a mule good as my Sal 
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal 

A friend of mine once got her sore 
Now he's got a broken jaw 
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe 
And kicked him back to Buffalo 

Low bridge, everybody down 
Low bridge 'cause we're coming to a town 
You'll always know your neighbor 
And you'll always know your pal 
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal 

Low bridge, everybody down 
Low bridge, we're coming to a town 
You'll always know your neighbor 
And you'll always know your pal 
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal 

Low bridge, everybody down* 
Low bridge, we're coming to a town* 
You'll always know your neighbor* 
And you'll always know your pal* 
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal* 

Low bridge, everybody down 
Low bridge, we're coming to a town 
Hooo...
