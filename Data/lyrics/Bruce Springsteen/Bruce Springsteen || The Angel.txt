
The angel rides with hunchbacked children, poison oozing from his engine 
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven 
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked 
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires stroke his precious pavement 

The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes 
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards 
Dragging great anchors, followin' dead-end signs into the sores 
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore 

Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain 
She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name 
Off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown 
The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones
