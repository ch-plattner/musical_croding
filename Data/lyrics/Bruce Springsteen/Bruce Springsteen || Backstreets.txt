
One soft infested summer 
Me and Terry became friends 
Trying in vain to breathe 
The fire we born in 
Catching rides to the outskirts 
Tying faith between our teeth 
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house 
Getting wasted in the heat 
And hiding on the backstreets 
Hiding on the backstreets 
With a love so hard and filled with defeat 
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets 

Slow dancing in the dark 
On the beach at Stockton's Wing 
Where desperate lovers park 
We sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings 
Huddled in our cars 
Waiting for the bells that ring 
In the deep heart of the night 
We let lose of everything 
To go running on the backstreets 
Running on the backstreets 
Terry you swore we'd live forever 
Taking it on them backstreets together 

Endless juke joints and Valentino drag 
Where famous dancers scraped the tears 
Up off the street dressed down in rags 
Running into the darkness 
Some hurt bad some really dying 
At night sometimes it seemed 
You could hear the whole damn city crying 
Blame it on the lies that killed us 
Blame it on the truth that ran us down 
You can blame it all on me Terry 
It don't matter to me now 
When the breakdown hit at midnight 
There was nothing left to say 
But I hated him 
And I hated you when you went away 

Laying here in the dark 
You're like an angel on my chest 
Just another tramp of hearts 
Crying tears of faithlessness 
Remember all the movies, Terry 
We'd go see 
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes 
We thought we had to be 
Well after all this time 
To find we're just like all the rest 
Stranded in the park 
And forced to confess 
To hiding on the backstreets 
Hiding on the backstreets 
Where we swore forever friends 
On the backstreets until the end 
Hiding on the backstreets 
Hiding on the backstreets...
