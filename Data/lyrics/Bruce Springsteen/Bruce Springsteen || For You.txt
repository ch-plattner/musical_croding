
Princess cards she sends me with her regards 
Barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard 
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted 
To her Cheshire smile, I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted 
But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts 
Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back 
You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks 
You said, "Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks" 
But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too 

[CHORUS]
I came for you, for you, I came for you 
But you did not need my urgency 
I came for you, for you, I came for you 
But your life was one long emergency 
And your cloud line urges me 
And my electric surges free 

Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak 
Reveal yourself all now to me, girl, while you've got the strength to speak 
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks 
But I could give it all to you now, if only you could ask 
And don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's too late 
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate 
Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back 
You and your pony face and your Union Jack 
Well, take your local joker and teach him how to act 
I swear I was never that way, even when I really cracked 
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive 
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound? 
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive 
You could laugh and cry in a single sound 

And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds 
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god? 

You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach 
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach 
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek 
That ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech 
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way 
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way 
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar 
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore 
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for 
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for 
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor 
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors 
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores? 
And you should know that's true 

[REPEAT CHORUS]
