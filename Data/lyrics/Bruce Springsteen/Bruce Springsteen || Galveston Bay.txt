For fifteen years Le Bin Son 
Fought side by side with the Americans 
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam 
In '75 Saigon fell and he left his command 
And brought his family to the promised land 

Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the Gulf of Mexico 
It was delta country and reminded him of home 
He worked as a machinist, put his money away 
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin 
And together they harvested Galveston Bay 

In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up 
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter 
Steer out through the channel 
And cast his nets into the water 

Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company 
In the highlands of Quang Tri 
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai 
Shipped home in '68 

There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds 
In a boat that'd been his father's 
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son 
And cast his nets into the water 

Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell 
And the communists rolled into Saigon 
He and his friends watched as the refugees came 
Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on 
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk 
Of America for Americans 
Someone said "You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out." 
And brought in the Texas Klan 

One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor 
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea 
In the fire's light shots rang out 
Two Texans lay dead on the ground 
Le stood with a pistol in his hand 

A jury acquitted him in self-defense 
As before the judge he did stand 
But as Le walked down the courthouse steps 
Billy said "My friend you're a dead man." 

One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside 
Billy stood in the shadows 
His K-bar knife in his hand 
And the moon slipped behind the clouds 
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass 
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket 
Took a breath and let him pass 

In the early darkness Billy rose up 
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water 
Kissed his sleeping wife 
Headed into the channel 
And cast his nets into the water 
Of Galveston Bay
