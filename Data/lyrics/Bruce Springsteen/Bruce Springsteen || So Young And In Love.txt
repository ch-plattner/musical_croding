
One! Two! Three!

There's flying angels on your fire escape
They lie to your mama for you, try to keep you safe
You're with them fire alley virgins on a midnight vamp
Lost your heart on Main Street to a beautiful tramp
You lost your mind
Yes, she's sent from above
You're so young and in love (so young and in love)
Alright (so young and in love)
Alright (so young and in love)
Alright (so young and in love)

Rat traps filled with soul crusaders
They're soppin' 'n' boppin' 'n' moppin' with Little Melvin and the Invaders
Missy's on the dance floor doin' her stuff
Leroy's dancin' doin' the continental strut
Sent from above
So young and in love
So young and in love
So young and in love
So young and in love

Everybody's reelin' when the band hits the ceilin'
Don't you know you wanna go
The kids start rockin' when the boys start knockin'
And everybody wants to go
Let's go!

Joint's shut down but you don't wanna go home
You're in the shady side of town and you're all alone
Papa's chewin' your ear off, you ain't got no cash
Mama's chewin' your ear off 'bout hangin' out with trash
So fine, sent from above
So young and in love
So young and in love
So young and in love
So young and in love
