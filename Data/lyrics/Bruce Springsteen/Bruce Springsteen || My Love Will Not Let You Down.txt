
At night I go to bed but I just can't sleep
I got something runnin' around my head oh that just won't keep
In the silence I hear my heart beatin', time slippin' away
I got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me, girl all I want to say
I keep searchin' for you darlin', searchin' everywhere I go
And when I find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know
One thing you gotta know

My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down

At night I walk the streets lookin' for romance
But I always end up stumblin' in a half trance
I search for a connection in some new eyes
That hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by
I see you standin' across the room watchin' me without a sound
But I'm gonna push my way through that crowd, I'm gonna tear your holy walls down
Tear all your walls down

My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down

Oh, well hold still now darlin', hold still for God's sake
'Cause I got me a promise I ain't afraid to make
I ain't afraid to make

My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
Whoa!
