
Once we ran and lived as one
In another world, my little one
Where whispering trees and dark rivers run
I told a dream to you
Now outside the streets are gray
And the childhood games we played
Have faded away

My baby, she has restless nights
(She has restless nights)
My baby, she has restless nights

On late-night movie screens
Young lovers look so sure
Lost in wide-wake dreams
That they can't afford
Once I held you in my arms
On a bed of stone
Now we have grown

My baby, she has restless nights
(She has restless nights)
My baby, she has restless nights

Once we ran and lived as one
In different world, my little one
Where whispering trees and dark rivers run
I told a dream to you
Now I pray, darling, for the night
We'll dance down these darkened halls
Once again to fall
Into a dream

My baby, she has restless nights
(She has restless nights)
My baby, she has restless nights
