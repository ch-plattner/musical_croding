Baby when I ask you if everything is alright
You whisper "Don't worry" and you shut out the light
Well now black is black in this bed we're laying
Yeah and I wanna believe the words yeah that your lips are saying

Whoa but your eyes look like a leavin' train
Yeah they keep on dragging me down
Your eyes look like a leavin' train
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin' me down

Well I did anything just to try to get close to you
Yeah I took it step by step yeah like a man's supposed to
Tell me now, is this my, baby, is this my contrition
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion

'Cause your eyes look like a leavin' train
Yeah they keep on dragging me down
Your eyes look like a leavin' train
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin' me down

[guitar solo]
Whoaaa yeah yeah...

So now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper
Is my train in vain, oh has my soul gone to waste
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith

Whoa but your eyes look like a leavin' train
Yeah they keep on dragging me down
'Cause your eyes look like a leavin' train
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin'
They keep on draggin' me down

[guitar solo]
Whoaaa yeah yeah...
