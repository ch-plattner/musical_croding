
Crazy Janey and her mission man 
Were back in the alley tradin' hands 
'Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-Man 
All duded up for Saturday night 
Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes 
And said, "Anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake? 
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88 
I got a bottle of ros√© so let's try it 
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe 
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go 
They're build like light 
And they dance like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night) 
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you 
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night) 
Stand up right now and let them shoot through you" 

Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat 
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap 
He said, "Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at 
Or at least it'll help you really feel it" 
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake 
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake 
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake 
I said, "I'm hurt." She said, "Honey, let me heal it" 
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band 
And she kissed me just right, like only a lonely angel can 
She felt so nice 
Just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night) 
Janey don't know what she do to you 
Spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night) 
Stand right up and let her shoot through me 

Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light 
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight 
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight 
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn 
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt 
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt 
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt 
Singin' our birthday songs 
Janey said it was time to go 
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row 
Felt so right 
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)...
