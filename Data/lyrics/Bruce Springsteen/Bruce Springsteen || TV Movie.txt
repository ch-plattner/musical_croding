
I woke up last night shaking from a dream
For in that dream I died
My wife rolled over and told me
That my life would be immortalized
Not in some major motion picture
Or great American novel, you see
No, they're gonna make a TV movie out of me

Well now, it's one two three you take the money
Yeah it's as easy as A B C
Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me

Well They can change my name or they can leave it
They can change my story too
Or they can make me black or Chinese
And do things that I never do
They're gonna give my life a whole new ending
And put me in prime time first-run
And when it's over, what I did there will be what I done

Now I don't want my name in a history book
Nobody's ever gonna see
No, they're gonna make a TV movie out of me

Well now, it's one two three you take the money
Yeah it's as easy as A B C
Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me

Well I'm a shoe-in for sponsor
Goodyear blimp and radial wheels
Somebody had a meeting somewhere
Somehow somebody made a deal
Well I was one of them kinds of stories
That everybody liked to see
Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me
Now I don't want no inscription on my gravestone
No long soliloquy
No they're gonna make a TV movie out of me

Well now, it's one two three you take the money
Yeah it's as easy as A B C
Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me
