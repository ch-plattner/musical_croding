
My feets were flyin' down the street just the other night 
When a Hong Kong special pulled up at the light 
What was inside, man, was just c'est magnifique 
I wanted to hold the bumper and let her drag me down the street. 

Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you tonight 

Sometimes I spot a little stranger standing 'cross the room 
My brain takes a vacation just to give my heart more room 
For one kiss, darling I swear everything I would give 
Cause you're a walking, talking reason to live 

Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you tonight 

Well now she might be the talk of high society 
She's probably got a lousy personality 
She might be a heiress to Rockefeller 
She might be a waitress or a bank teller 
She makes the Venus de Milo look like she's got no style 
She makes Sheena of the Jungle look meek and mild 
I need a quick shot, Doc, knock me off my feet 
Cause I'll be minding my own business walking down the street... watchout ! 

Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you 
Ooh, ooh I gotta crush on you tonight
