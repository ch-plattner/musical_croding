
Well it's Saturday night 
You're all dressed up in blue 
I been watching you awhile 
Maybe you been watching me too 
So somebody ran out 
Left somebody's heart in a mess 
Well if you're looking for love 
Honey I'm tougher than the rest 

Some girls they want a handsome Dan 
Or some good-lookin' Joe, on their arm 
Some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo 
Well 'round here baby 
I learned you get what you can get 
So if you're rough enough for love 
Honey I'm tougher than the rest 

The road is dark 
And it's a thin thin line 
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time 
Maybe your other boyfriends 
Couldn't pass the test 
Well if you're rough and ready for love 
Honey I'm tougher than the rest 

Well it ain't no secret 
I've been around a time or two 
Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too 
Well there's another dance 
All you gotta do is say yes 
And if you're rough and ready for love 
Honey I'm tougher than the rest 
If you're rough enough for love 
Baby I'm tougher than the rest
