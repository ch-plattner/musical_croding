
Whoa!
Hmmm

Seven angels got my number since I fell in love with you
Seven angels got my number, they're all telling me what to do
First angel says "Go on and love her"
Second angels says "Ain't you tired of being alone?"
Third angel says "Do the right thing, meat"
Fourth angels says "Check that other little angel walkin' on down the street"

Seven angels got my number since I fell in love with you
Seven angels got my number, they're all telling me what to do
Fifth angels says "Don't worry
Love's waitin' 'round the corner for you, son"
Sixth angel says "You better hurry
It don't take long for the good to get gone"
Walkin' on wings all sexy and blue
Seventh angel says I'm a fool

Hey!
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!

I got seven angels calling on my pride
Seven devils crawling around inside
Seven angels tellin' me which way to turn, whoa!
One kiss and my soul wanna burn

Hey!

Seven angels got my number since I fell in love with you
Seven angels got my number, they're all telling me what to do
The earth's so lonely, sad and blue
And without love, your soul's dyin'
Sixth angel says to believe you
When you say you'll never leave me cryin'
Seventh angel says you're lyin'

Whoa!
