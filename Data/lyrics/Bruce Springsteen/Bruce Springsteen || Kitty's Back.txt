
Catlong sighs, holdin' Kitty's black tooth 
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth? 
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley 
Since Sally left with Big Pretty, things have got pretty thin 
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin' in 

Jack Knife cries 'cause Baby's in a bundle 
She goes runnin' nightly, lightly through the jungle 
And them tin cans are explodin' out of the 90-degree heat 
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street 
It's sad but it sure is true 
Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs 

Catlong lies back-bent on a trash can 
Flashin' lights that cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man 
Well, you better move fast when you're young, or you're not around 
Cat somehow lost his Kitty in the city pound 
So get right, get tight, get down 
Who's that down at the end of the alley? She's been gone so long 
Here she comes, here she comes 
Here she comes, here she comes 

Kitty's back in town, here she comes now 
Kitty's back in town 
Cat knows Kitty's been untrue and that she left him for a city dude 
Well, she's so soft, she's so blue 
When he looks into her eyes, he just sits back and sighs 
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do? 
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do? Alright 
Ooh alright, ooh alright 
Ooh alright, ooh alright
