Spread out now Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins 
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game 
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'll pick up Little Gun 
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run 
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son 
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft, sweet, little girl's tongue 
And Rosie, you're the one 

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats 
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats 
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus 
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us 
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, 'cause you know we ain't gonna come 
I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun 
And Rosie, you're the one 

[CHORUS]
Rosalita, jump a little higher 
Senorita, come sit by my fire 
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar 
Rosalita, you're my stone desire 

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knee Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there 
Sloppy Sue and Big Bone Billy, they'll be coming up for air 
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school 
Act real cool, stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright 
So Rosie, come out tonight, little baby, come out tonight 
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor 
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door 
So use it, Rosie, that's what it's there for 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Now, I know your mama, she don't like me, 'cause I play in a rock and roll band 
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand 
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room-- I'm comin' to lend a hand 
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man 
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny 
But now you're sad, your mama's mad 
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money 
Your papa says he knows that I don't have any money 
Oh, your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money 
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance 
'Cause a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance 

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy 
And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey 
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong 
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms 
I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way 
There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day 
You can hear them in the back room strummin' 
So hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know Daddy's comin' 
Everybody sing 

Rosalita, jump a little higher 
Senorita, come sit by my fire 
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar 
Oh Baby, you're my stone desire 

Hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey
