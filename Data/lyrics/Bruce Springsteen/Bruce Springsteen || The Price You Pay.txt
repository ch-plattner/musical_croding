
You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take 
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks 
Out on to an open road you ride until the day 
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay 

Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies 
And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death 
Driving on through the night, unable to break away 
From the restless pull of the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long 
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong 
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day 
And you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Little girl down on the strand 
With that pretty little baby in your hands 
Do you remember the story of the promised land 
How he crossed the desert sands 
And could not enter the chosen land 
On the banks of the river he stayed 
To face the price you pay 

So let the game start, you better run you little wild heart 
You can run through all the nights and all the days 
But just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign 
That counts the men fallen away to the price you pay, and girl before the end of the day, 
I'm gonna tear it down and throw it away
