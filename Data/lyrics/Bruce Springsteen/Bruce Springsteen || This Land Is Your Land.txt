
Well I rode that ribbon highway 
I saw above me the endless sky 
I saw below me the golden valley 
This land was made for you and me 

I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps 
Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts 
And all around me a voice was calling 
This land was made for you and me 

This land is your land 
This land is my land 
From California 
To the New York island 
From the Redwood Forest 
To the Gulf Stream waters 
This land was made for you and me 

Well the sun came shining and I was strolling 
Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling 
And a voice was sounding 
As the fog was lifting 
Saying this land was made for you and me 

This land is your land 
This land is my land 
From California 
To the New York island 
From the Redwood Forest 
To the Gulf Stream waters 
This land was made for you and me
