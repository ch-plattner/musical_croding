
I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only 
It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely 
I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake 
When your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak 

Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man 
Cause they can't do it, like I can 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker 

If you're hanging from a cliff or you're tied to the tracks, girl 
Columbo split and you can't find Kojak 
True love is broken and your tears are fallin' faster 
You're sufferin' from a pain in your heart or some other natural disaster 

Now I don't care what kind of shape you're in 
If they put up a roadblock, I'll parachute in 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - I'm in love 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - with you 

So you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome 
Then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom 
Well, like a mission impossible I'm gonna go and get it back 
You know I would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that 

Sometimes I get so hot girl, well, I can't talk 
But when I'm with you I cool off, and I walk 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, and I talk 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day 
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day
