
Here in northeast Ohio 
Back in eighteen-o-three 
James and Dan Heaton 
Found the ore that was linin' Yellow Creek 
They built a blast furnace 
Here along the shore 
And they made the cannonballs 
That helped the Union win the war 

Here in Youngstown 
Here in Youngstown 
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
Here darlin' in Youngstown 

Well my daddy worked the furnaces 
Kept 'em hotter than hell 
I come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer 
A job that'd suit the devil as well 
Taconite coke and limestone 
Fed my children and make my pay 
Them smokestacks reachin' like the arms of God 
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay 

Here in Youngstown 
Here in Youngstown 
Sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
Here darlin' in Youngstown 

Well my daddy come on the Ohio works 
When he come home from World War Two 
Now the yard's just scrap and rubble 
He said "Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do." 
These mills they built the tanks and bombs 
That won this country's wars 
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam 
Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for 

Here in Youngstown 
Here in Youngstown 
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
Here darlin' in Youngstown 

From the Monongahela valley 
To the Mesabi iron range 
To the coal mines of Appalachia 
The story's always the same 
Seven hundred tons of metal a day 
Now sir you tell me the world's changed 
Once I made you rich enough 
Rich enough to forget my name 

And Youngstown 
And Youngstown 
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
Here darlin' in Youngstown 

When I die I don't want no part of heaven 
I would not do heaven's work well 
I pray the devil comes and takes me 
To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell
