
They're holding a committee of treason and lies
Double speak and sedition then somebody dies
From the hills the smell of lilacs then the repeat of guns
When she closes the window and draws the blinds her first touch sucks the air from my lungs

Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright

She says, "In this house we've abandoned history, in this house there are no laws
Just the false taste of paradise and then the fall
In this house the guilty go unpunished and blood and silence prevail
Here the dead remain nameless, the nameless remain jailed"

Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright

In this house there's just the dust of bones, the basement's filled with liars
In this house our sons and daughters are spilled like wine
So come close my pretty darling and let me feel your disease
Tonight I'll have you naked and crawling at the end of my leash

Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright

She says, "In this house it's so easy to set a world on fire
All you need is the need and the money and a soul full of reckless desire
Upstairs the landlord is dining here with his criminal friends
Don't worry, they'll have the bags packed and be long gone before the real fucking begins"

Hey Blue Eyes, yeah, what you doing tonight
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright
Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright
