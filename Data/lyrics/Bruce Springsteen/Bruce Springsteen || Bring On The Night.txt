
I lie in bed but baby I can't sleep no matter how hard I try
There's something bad, baby, wrong with me whenever I close my eyes
The dreams of Mary keep me awake with every little curve in place
When I walk home in the daybreak I pray come back home, baby, won't you give me
Darlin' bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night
Oh now darlin', bring on the night

I walk the street, I'm lookin' for romance
I end up stumblin' in some stupid half-trance
As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance
We watch the disco dancers dance

I look for connection in some new eyes
But for protection they're tranquilized
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who lies

Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night
Oh now darlin', bring on the night

Is it as simple as it seems
I don't know what I'm doin' here, is it as simple as it seems
Is it as simple as I fear, well if I'm right...

I look for connection in some new eyes
But for protection they're tranquilized
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who
Baby of who's tellin' who lies

Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night
Oh now baby, bring on the night, oh now darlin' bring on the night
Come home darlin', bring on the night
Oh now darlin' bring on the night
