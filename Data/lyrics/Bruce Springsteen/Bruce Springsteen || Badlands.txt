
Lights out tonight,
Trouble in the heartland,
Got a head on collision,
Smashin' in my guts, man,
I'm caught in a cross fire,
That I don't understand,
But there's one thing I know for sure, girl,
I don't give a damn
For the same old played out scenes,
Baby, I don't give a damn
For just the in-betweens,
Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul,
I want control right now,
You better listen to me, baby

Talk about a dream,
Try to make it real
You wake up in the night,
With a fear so real,
You spend your life waiting,
For a moment that just don't come,
Well, don't waste your time waiting,

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay,
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood,
And these badlands start treating us good.

Workin' in the fields
'til you get your back burned,
Workin' 'neath the wheels
'til you get your facts learned,
Baby, I got my facts
Learned real good right now,
You better get it straight, darlin'
Poor man wanna be rich,
Rich man wanna be king,
And a king ain't satisfied,
'til he rules everything,
I wanna go out tonight,
I wanna find out what I got

Well, I believe in the love that you gave me,
I believe in the faith that can save me,
I believe in the hope and I pray,
That someday it may raise me
Above these badlands

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay,
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood,
And these badlands start treating us good.

For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside,
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place,
I wanna spit in the face of these...

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay,
We'll keep movin' 'til it's understood,
And these badlands start treating us good.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!
Whoa whoa whoa
