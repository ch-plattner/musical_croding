Propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks for a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks 
Took her down to the carwash check the plugs and points 
I'm goin' out tonight I'm gonna rock that joint 

Early north Jersey industrial skyline I'm a all set cobra jet creepin' through the nighttime 
Gotta find a gas station gotta find a payphone this turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone 
Gotta hit the gas 'cause I'm runnin' late, this New Jersey n the mornin' like a lunar landscape 

The boss don't dig me so he put me on the nightshift 
It's an all night run to get back to where my baby lives 
In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy radio relay towers won't you lead me to my baby 
Underneath the overpass trooper hits his party light switch 
Goodnight good luck one two powershift 

I met Wanda when she was employed behind the counter at the route 60 Bobs Big Boy fried chicken on the front seat she's sittin' in my lap 
We're wipin' our fingers on a Texaco roadmap 
I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill with them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still 

5 A.M. oil pressure's sinkin' fast 
I make a pit stop wipe the windshield check the gas 
Gotta call my baby on the telephone 
Let her know that her daddy's comin' on home 
Sit tight little mamma I'm commin' round I got 3 more hours but I'm coverin' ground 

Your eyes get itchy in the wee wee hours sun's just a red ball risin' over them refinery towers 
Radio's jammed up with gospel stations lost souls callin' long distance salvation 
Hey mr. deejay woncha hear my last prayer hey ho rock 'n roll deliver me from nowhere
