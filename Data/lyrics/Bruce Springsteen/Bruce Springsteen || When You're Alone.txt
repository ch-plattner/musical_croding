
Times were though love was not enough 
So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone 
You said my act was funny 
But we both knew what was missing honey 
So you lit out on your own 
Now that pretty form that you've got baby 
Will make sure you get along 
But you're gonna find out some day honey 

When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone 

Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city 
And I fought to make 'em my home 
With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back 
And man I was gone gone gone 
But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming 
And send you crawling like a baby back home 
You're gonna find out that day sugar 

When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone 

I knew some day your runnin' would be through 
And you'd think back on me and you 
And your love would be strong 
You'd forget all about the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had 
And you'd wanna come home 
Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar 
That ain't what's got me singing this song 
It's just nobody knows honey where love goes 
But when it goes it's gone gone 

When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you're alone 
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
