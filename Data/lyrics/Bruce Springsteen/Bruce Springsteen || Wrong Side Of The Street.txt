
Ah-One, two, three, four

Girl on the edge flippin' off the lamp
There'll be an end, darling, to your endless night
On the other side of the street
Yeah, light on portrait and the light in your face
And you'll be looking for another pretty place
Baby, this side of the street

Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true
If you can't take the heat, what can I do?

Well, you and your poetry and your cuckoo world
Behind your face hides the face of a modern girl
Yeah, on the other side of the street
Yeah, you've got the look as if you own the world
Therefore, you go out there and they say that you can earn
Baby, on this side of the street

Well, you're tired of everyday bringing the same and so you
Go out looking for some strange new games
Well pretty soon you don't know the score anymore
All right!

[guitar solo]

Oh, I know you danger that your desire brings
And I know the strangeness that you'll find
Waiting and you'll see straighter then for you and for me
Yeah
Well turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps
There'll be an end, darling, to your endless night
On the wrong side of the street

Yeah and everyday, well, it just brings the same
You started looking for some other strange new game
On the wrong side of the street
Well, your desires for your sweet confusion
I'll walk away then, I don't buy your delusions
I'll see, open your eyes and see, girl
All right
