He's lookin' down kinda puzzled pokin' that dog with a stick 
Got his car door flung open he's standin' out on highway 31 
Like if he stood there long enough that dog'd get up and run 
Struck me kinda funny seem kinda funny sir to me 
Still at the end of every hard day people find some reason to believe 

Now Mary Lou loved Johnny with a love mean and true 
She said baby I'll work for you everyday and bring my money home to you 
One day he up and left her and ever since that 
She waits down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny to come back 
Struck me kinda funny funny yea indeed how at the end of every hard earned day you can find some reason to believe 

Take a baby to the river Kyle William they called him 
Wash the baby in the water take away little Kyle's sin 
In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away take the body to the graveyard and over him they pray Lord won't you tell us, 
Tell us what does it mean 
At the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe 

Congregation gathers down by the riverside 
Preacher stands with his bible, groom stands waitin' for his bride 
Congregation gone and the sun sets behind a weepin' willow tree 
Groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly 
Wonderin' where can his baby be still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe
