
Took my baby to a picture show 
Found a seat in the back row 
Sound came up lights went down 
Rambo he was blowin' 'em down 
I don't need no gun in my fist baby 
All I need is your sweet kiss 
To get me feelin' like a real man 
Feelin' like a real man 
Well you can beat on your chest 
Hell any monkey can 
But you got me feelin' like a real man 
Oh feelin' like a real man 

Me and my girl Saturday night 
Late movie on channel five 
The girls were droppin' they're droppin' like flies 
To some smooth talkin' cool walkin' private eye 
I ain't got no nerves of steel 
But all I got to know is if your love is real 
To get me feelin' like a real man 
Oh feelin' like a real man 

Well you can beat on your chest 
Hell any monkey can 
Your love's got me feelin' like a real man 
Oh feelin' like a real man 

I ain't no fighter that's easy to see 
And as a lover I ain't goin' down in history 
But when the lights go down and you pull me close 
Well I look in your eyes and there's one thing I know 
Baby I'll be tough enough 
If I can find the guts to give you all my love 
Then I'll be feelin' like a real man 
Feelin' like a real man 
Well you can beat on your chest 
Hell any monkey can 
You got me feelin' like a real man 
Oh feelin' like a real man 
Yeah I been felin' like a real man 
Feelin' like a real man
