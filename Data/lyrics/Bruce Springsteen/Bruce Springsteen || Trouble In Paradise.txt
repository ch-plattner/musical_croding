
You do the drying, I'll do the dishes
Who'll do the crying when all the wishes don't come true
You do the washing, I'll do the folding
Whose heart is breaking
When whose arms are holding someone new
Sittin' on a peaceful lake sunnin'
Didn't hear the roar of the waterfall coming
When it's all a storybook story
When it's all so easy and nice
Here comes trouble in paradise

You did the dusting, I did the sweeping
You did the driving oh and I did the sleeping a little too long
On a picnic 'neath the sky so blue
We didn't see the rain and heartache coming through
When it's all an old black and white movie
And you're sure you've seen the ending twice
Here comes trouble in paradise

You said everything was fine
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't see the signs
Oh so beautifully you read your lines
But in a play where the hero has no vice
And love comes without a price
So does trouble in paradise

Don't matter who did the dusting or who did the sweeping
Who did the trusting or who did the cheating when it's all gone
Laying in a field on a summer's day
Waitin' for those gary skies to clear away
Knowing all love's glory and beauty
Can vanish before you think twice
Leaving trouble in paradise

Now we share the laughing, we share the joking
We do the sleeping with one eye open
