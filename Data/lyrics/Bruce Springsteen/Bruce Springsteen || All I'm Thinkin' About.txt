
One, two, three, four

Blind man wavin' by the side of the road
In a flatbed Ford carryin' a heavy load
Sweet thing sipping on a blueberry wine
On a flat black highway down in Carolina
Black bird slipping in a sky of blue

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
There ain't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Little boy carryin' a fishing pole
Little girl pickin' huckleberries from off of the vine
Brown bag filled with a little green toad
We hook him through the the lip and throw him off with a line
A sweet pair of legs got me feelin' so blue

And all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
There ain't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Black car shiny on a Sunday morn'
Mama go to church now
Mama go to church now
Friday night and Daddy's shirt is torn
Daddy's going downtown
Daddy's going downtown
Ain't no one understand the sweet thing you do

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Whoaaa

Field turned up, the seed is sowed
Rain comin' in from over across the road
Big black curtain comin' across the field
Blind will see and lame will be healed
Brown-eyed girl, turn my back on you
Now it's lonely

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
And all I'm thinkin' about is you
And all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
There ain't nothing in this world take away these blues
All I'm thinkin' about is you

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Well baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you
Yeah all I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Whoaaa
