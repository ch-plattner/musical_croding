
Do you still say your prayers little darlin' do you go to bed at night 
Prayin' that tomorrow, everything will be alright 
But tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one 
You wake up and you're dying you don't even know what from 

Well they shot you point blank you been shot in the back 
Baby point blank you been fooled this time little girl that's a fact 
Right between the eyes baby, point blank right between the pretty lies that they tell 
Little girl you fell 

You grew up where young girls they grow up fast 
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked 
but what they asked baby wasn't right 
you didn't have to live that life, 
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet 
These days you don't wait on Romeo's you wait on that welfare check 
and on all the pretty things that you can't ever have and on all the promises 

That always end up point blank, shot between the eyes 
Point blank like little white lies you tell to ease the pain 
You're walkin' in the sights, girl of point blank 
and it's one false move and baby the lights go out 

Once I dreamed we were together again baby you and me 
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be 
We were standin' at the bar it was hard to hear 
The band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear 
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four 
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor 
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow 
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go 

Well I saw you last night down on the avenue 
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you 
You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain 
You didn't answer when I called out your name 
You just turned, and then you looked away like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away 

Point blank, right between the eyes 
Point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell 
Point blank, shot straight through the heart, 
Yea point blank, you've been twisted up till you've become just another part of it 
Point blank, you're walkin' in the sights, 
Point blank, livin' one false move just one false move away 
Point blank, they caught you in their sights 
Point blank, did you forget how to love, girl, did you forget how to fight. 
Point blank they must have shot you in the head 
Cause point blank, bang bang baby you're dead.
