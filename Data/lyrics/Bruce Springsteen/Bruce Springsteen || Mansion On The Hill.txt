There's place out on the edge of town sir 
Risin' above the factories and the fields 
Now ever since I was a child I can remember that mansion on the hill 

In the day you can see the children playing 
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel 
Steel gates that completely surround sir the mansion on the hill 

At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride through the streets of a town so silent and still 
Park on a back road along the highway side 
Look up at that mansion on the hill 

In the summer all the lights would shine there'd be music playin' people laughin' all the time 
Me and my sister we'd hide out in the tall corn fields 
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill 

Tonight down here in Linden Town I watch the cars rushin' by home from the mill 
There's a beautiful full moon rising above the mansion on the hill
