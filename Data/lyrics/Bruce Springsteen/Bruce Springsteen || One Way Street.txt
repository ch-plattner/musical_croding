
If the sun should fall from the skytomorrow
If the rain brings the tears to your eye, I would share your sorrow
But you must go if you can't take the heat, our love was fine, our love was sweet
But we was walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street

Well I'm not with all those guys, who rode out in your eyes 
Sometimes, ya sometimes, I can't forget your lines
But hold the train, just come today, and for your wrong, well you must pay
And we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street

If I'm old my darlin' eye, I must confess
That this can't be love, no I must be a man possessed
When I look in your eyes so bright, your walkin' and your dress fits you just right
But we were walkin' on a dead end, runnin' down a one way street

Well their's a man, could change the things, he feels inside
If for once I, could turn and make it swallow some of my pride
But for the wrongs, oh yes we must pay, so its bye bye baby today
And we'll go walkin' on that wildside, runnin' down a one way street

Yeah when I think, of all the girls, that I have I missed
Well I know I, would give them up, for just one kiss
That's nn..we, we are the same kind, and to leave you baby, I have to go blind
Oh when we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
Oh oh yes we are, we'll keep walkin' on that badside, runnin' down that one way street
Ohh yes we will, we'll keep walkin' on that badside, runnin' down a one way street
