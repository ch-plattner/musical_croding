
Friday night's pay night, guys fresh out of work 
Talking about the weekend, scrubbing off the dirt 
Some heading home to their families, some looking to get hurt 
Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts 
I work for the county out on 95 
All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by 
In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss 
Someday, mister, I'm gonna lead a better life than this 

[CHORUS]
Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop 
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop 
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock 
Working on the highway, working on the highway 

I met her at a dance down at the union hall 
She was standing with her brothers, back up against the wall 
Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks 
One day I looked straight at her and she looked straight back 
So I'm... 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I saved up my money and I put it all away 
I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say 
"Son, can't you see that she's just a little girl 
She don't know nothing about this cruel, cruel world" 
We lit out down to Florida, we got along all right 
One day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black-and-white 
The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day 
And the judge got mad and he put me straight away 
I wake up every morning to the work bell clang 
Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang 
I'm... 

[REPEAT CHORUS TWICE]
