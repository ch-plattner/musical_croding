
We played king of the mountain out on the end 
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men 
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away 
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take 
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other 
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers 
Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away 
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make 
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray 
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay 
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover 
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother 

On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks 
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back 
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight 
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight 
I don't even know why, I don't know why I made this call 
Or if any of this matters anymore after all 

But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered 
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart 
My blood brother 

[Alternate last verse as performed July 1, 2000, at Madison Square Garden, New York:]
Now on out here on this road 
Out on this road tonight 
I close my eyes and feel so many friends around me 
In the early evening light 
And the miles we have come 
And the battles won and lost 
Are just so many roads travelled 
So many rivers crossed 
And I ask God for the strength 
And faith in one another 
'Cause it's a good night for a ride 
Cross this river to the other side 
My blood brothers
