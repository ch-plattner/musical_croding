You won't say nothing, nothing at all
You just sit there, you won't open that pretty mouth
I think you like keeping my back up against the wall
Wages of sin, you keep me paying
Wages of sin, for wrongs that I've done
Wages of sin, you keep me paying
Wages of sin, one by one

I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place
You're crouched in the corner with makeup running down your face
I don't wanna believe what my, what my heart keeps saying
You keep me on the line so you can keep me paying
Wages of sin, we keep paying
Wages of sin, for the wrongs that we've done
Wages of sin, yeah, we keep paying
Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun

Ah ah ah

I remember when I was a little boy out, out where the cottonwoods grow tall
Trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Baby all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real
I was running down that broken path with the devil snapping at my heels
I tried so hard, so hard in every way
Swore someday I'd grow up and just throw it all away
Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry
Stomached all my fears 'til they came rushing up inside
Darling I'm losing and it's a mean game
Still I play on and on just the same
Wages of sin, yeah, I keep paying
Wages of sin, for some wrong that I've done
Wages of sin, well, I keep paying
Wages of sin, one by one

Ah ah ah, ah
