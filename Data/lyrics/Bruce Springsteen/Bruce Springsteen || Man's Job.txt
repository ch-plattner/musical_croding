
Well you can go out with him 
Play with all of his toys 
But takin' care of you darlin' 
Ain't for one of the boys 
Oh there's somethin' in your soul 
That he's gonna rob 
And lovin' you baby lovin' you darlin' 
Lovin' you woman is a man's man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job baby 
Lovin' you's a man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job baby 
Lovin' you's a man's job 

Well now his kisses may thrill 
Those other girls that he likes 
But when it comes to treatin' 
A real woman right 
Well all of his tricks 
No they won't be enough 
'Cause lovin' you baby lovin' you woman 
Lovin' you darlin' is a man's man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job baby 
Lovin' you's a man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job baby 
Lovin' you's a man's job 

You're dancin' with him he's holding you tight 
I'm standing here waitin' to catch your eye 
Your hand's on his neck as the music sways 
All my illusions slip away 

Now if you're lookin' for a hero 
Someone to save the day 
Well darlin' my feet 
They're made of clay 
But I've got somethin' in my soul 
And I wanna give it up 
But gettin' up the nerve 
Gettin' up the nerve 
Gettin' up the nerve is a man's man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job baby 
Lovin' you's a man's job 
Lovin' you's a man's job woman 
Lovin' you's a man's job
