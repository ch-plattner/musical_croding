Woke up this morning my house was cold 
Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin' 
Went out and hoped in my old Ford 
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin' 
We've given each other some hard lessons lately 
But we ain't learnin' 
We're the same sad story that's a fact 
One step up and two steps back 

Bird on a wire outside my motel room 
But he ain't singin' 
Girl in white outside a church in June 
But the church bells they ain't ringing 
I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight 
But all I'm thinkin' is 
I'm the same old story same old act 
One step up and two steps back 

It's the same thing night on night 
Who's wrong baby who's right 
Another fight and I slam the door on 
Another battle in our dirty little war 
When I look at myself I don't see 
The man I wanted to be 
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track 
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back 

There's a girl across the bar 
I get the message she's sendin' 
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married 
And me well honey I'm pretending 
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms 
The music was never-ending 
We danced as the evening sky faded to black 
One step up and two steps back
