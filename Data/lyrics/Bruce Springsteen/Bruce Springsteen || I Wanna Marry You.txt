I see you walking, baby, down the street 
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet 
I see that lonely ribbon in your hair 
Tell me am I the man for whom you put it there 

You never smile girl, you never speak 
You just walk on by, darlin', week after week 
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world 
Must be a lonely life for a working girl 

Little girl, I wanna marry you 
Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you 
Yes I do 
Little girl, I wanna mary you 

Now, honey, I don't wanna clip your wings 
But a time comes when two people should think of these things 
Having a home and a family 
Facing up to their responsibilities 
They say in the end true love prevails 
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale 
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong 
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along 

Little girl, I wanna marry you 
Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you 
Yes I do 
Little girl, I wanna mary you 

My daddy said right before he died 
That true, true love was just a lie 
He went to his grave a broken heart 
An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard 

Oh darlin' 
There's something happy and there's something sad 
'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad, 
I wear my love darlin', without shame 
I'd be proud if you would wear my name
