And come spit on bridges with me, 
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me be.

I'll keep my jealousy close, 
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy, 
Then I'm not the only one lying.

Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret 
And your biggest mistake.
The hand behind this pen relives a failure every day.

So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down. 
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.
