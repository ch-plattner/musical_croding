Clap until your hands hurt,
Standing ovations or boos. 
Watch until we blur, walk off into the sunset. 
Tell rock n' roll I'm alone again.
I wanna put the mid-west home again.
Your time has passed, they say never means never
But so the fast stares won't last but never means forever.
Never means forever..

Alpha dog and omegalomaniac.
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo-
Welcome to the new déjà vu. 
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains. 
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac. 

We must have the best coats, 
tell the best jokes, 
we must make it look so easy 
doing something so hard.
You must see my way, 
that's when they look at me. 
I'm a, I'm a star,
I'm a, I'm a star. 
I'm a star.

Alpha dog and omegalomaniac.
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo-
Welcome to the new déjà vu.
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains.
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac. 

You're not the first or the last, 
but your possibly the prettiest. Whoa.
He's a fighter past his prime,
he's in the gutter waving his hand, 
I'm just fine.  
Not the first or the last, 
but your possibly the prettiest. Whoa.
He's a fighter past his prime, 
he's in the gutter waving his hand, 
I'm just fine. 

Alpha dog and omegalomaniac. 
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo-
Welcome to the new déjà vu.
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains.
