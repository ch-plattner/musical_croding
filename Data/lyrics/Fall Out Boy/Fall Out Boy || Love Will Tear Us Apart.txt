
When routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways,
taking different roads

Love, love will tear us apart again 
And love, love will tear us apart again 
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is this bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed,
our respect runs so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives

Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep?
All my feelings exposed.
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Love, love will tear us apart again 
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
