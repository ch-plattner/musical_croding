
Do you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to)
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to)

You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again, and again, and again
And you can get what you want but it is never enough

And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to

[iLoveMakonnen:]
You used to, used to every night
But you played me every time
How could I be so dumb
You said I was your favorite one
And now it's true
You don't really want me the way you used to
When I was always the one there for you
Like for your favorite records, I will spin for you
Oh, spin for you

You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again, and again, and again
And you can get what you want but it is never enough

And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to

I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yoooooou-oooh-oh
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, used to)
