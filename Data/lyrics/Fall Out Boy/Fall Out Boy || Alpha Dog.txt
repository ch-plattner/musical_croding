
Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or boos
Watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell rock and roll I'm alone again,
I want to put the Midwest home again
Your time has passed they say never means never
Solar flare stares won't last but never means forever
Never means forever

Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh oh mega mega low
Welcome to the new deja vu 
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains,
Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac

We must have the best coats,
Tell the best jokes
We must make it hard to look so easy 
Doing something so hard
You must see my wink
They squint when they look at me
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a star
Oh, I'm a star

Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh oh mega mega low
Welcome to the new deja vu 
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains,
Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac

You're not the first or the last
but you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand,
"I'm just fine"

You're not the first or the last
but you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand

Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh oh mega mega low
Welcome to the new deja vu 
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains,
Alpha dog and oh oh omegalomaniac

(whoaa, ohh, whoaa)
[Whispered:] Abracadabra
(whoaa, ohh, whoaa)
