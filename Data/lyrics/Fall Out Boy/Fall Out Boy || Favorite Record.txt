
Do you do, do you remember 
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced
To Rancid, and we danced, we danced

And I confessed, confessed to you 
Riding shotgun underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down, and we danced, we danced

(Spin for you like your favorite records used to…)
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to…)

You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I’ve ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it’s never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to

And I can’t, I can’t, I can’t remember
Just how to forget, forget the way 
That we danced, we danced
To Danzig, and we danced, we danced

And when you ask, you ask me how I’m doing 
Like you know, you know how much better off I am
And when we danced, we danced 
With windows down, and we danced, we danced

(Spin for you like your favorite records used to…)
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to…)

You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I’ve ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it’s never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to

I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yeah…

(Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to…)
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to…)
