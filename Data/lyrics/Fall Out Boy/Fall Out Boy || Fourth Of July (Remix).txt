You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire
(You are now listening when the [?])

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[OG Maco:]
From the last time we talking got me feeling defeated
Since the last time we talked your shit almost got deleted
It's nothin' personal, personally, just thoughts of you hurting me
I pushed [?] all the shit [?] of misery
[?] still got bitch
Let go of my white women and I still got licks
The sex was on fire, shit we still sexy
Them hoes was one too many, how they still your friends?
I'd explode from the pressure
Yeah, the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh Honey, you don't have to lie

Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[OG Maco:]
We were fireworks
On the fourth of July
Shining bright in the sky
We went off too soon, yeah
We were playing with fire
In the middle of June
It can explode from the pressure
Yeah the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
