Sometimes when I'm in heaven
I get forgetful of the Earth, woah
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is on, 
Fixed up and the shade is down

I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Box blondes have less fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

I've got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night times
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
Till Lakeshore Drive comes back into focus
I just wanna come back to love
Spark, oh can you hear me
Keep you warm enough

I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Box blondes have less fun, fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
