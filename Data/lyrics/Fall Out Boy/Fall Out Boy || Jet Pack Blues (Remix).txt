[Big K.R.I.T:]
I know you heard that I got nominated
Won't you walk the red carpet with it
With a dress I bought you, it's awful when I've been gone too long
And I call like it ain't been a while
That promise that I hold you down seem like a lyric from your favorite song
I'm not surprised if you step aside and get another
Way too hard to reach like a boy in a bubble
Always on a shuttle to another planet
It's crazy how my crash landed only leave you damaged
I just keep up all the pieces that I left you in
Hoping praying when I'm home I see you again
And you understand I'm being the man I need to be
To provide for the lives of you and me
Cause you know that

I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"

[Big K.R.I.T:]
I'm talking about another green room, another hotel
Doing what I'm doing a lot, doing it well
Maybe we should kick it next time, go out all the time
Bone appetite it's so bittersweet when I come around
Always on the phone texting and scrolling talking bout business
[?] when I visit
And that's the realest [?] you whispered in my ear
The last time you cried on the phone, I felt the tear, believe it or not
When I vamp, I give you all that I got
I do this for us so don't ask me to stop
The lights and glamour ain't the reason why I put in this work
I'm seconds from the stage but I'm putting you first
Despite my absence, words and closed captions
Read me like a simple I love you wrote on a napkin
This is more than just a fly by night action
You're the fuel everlasting to keep my jet packing

I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"
