[Verse 1]
I just want to fill you all with such dread
Let you suck it out, let you suck it out 'til I'm dry and dead
Now I've got love flowin' in my nightmare girl
Caffeine cold, caffeine cold and I can't see shit

[Hook]
Don't breathe life into a monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again
Don't breathe life into a monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again

[Verse 2]
Now I smell like cigarettes cause I love to breathe your smoke
I smell like alcohol cause I drink to believe in more
I have 3 drinks before I even start to count
I think I'm gonna move way down south

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm not a monster
Just really fucked up
I'm tired
I'll see you in hell
Are you judging me?
Don't laugh at me
Don't laugh at me
No seriously don't laugh at me
It's not funny
I'm not joking
It's not funny
I'm not laughing
