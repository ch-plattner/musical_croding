Yeah, what you critics said would never happen.
We dedicate this album to anybody, people said couldn't make it.
To the fans that held us down till everybody came around.
Welcome. It's here.

Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall we were a cover story "now in stores"
Make us poster boys for your scene 
But we are not making an acceptance speech 
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes 
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update 

So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 

So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am 
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife 
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 

So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45 

Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)

Long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life 
Fix me in 45
