Say my name, and his in the same breath,
I dare you to say they taste the same,
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames

Erase myself and let go,
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now

[Chorus:]
I don't care what you think,
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness, in misery
I said I don't care what you think,
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness, in misery

Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance,
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette,
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no

I'm the oracle in my chest,
Let the guitar scream like a fascist,
Sweat it out, shut your mouth,
Free love on the streets, but
In the alley it ain't that cheap now

[Chorus]

I don't care
I don't care

[Chorus]
