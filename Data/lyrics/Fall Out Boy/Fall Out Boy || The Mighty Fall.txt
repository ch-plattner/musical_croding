Oh God!

Fall Out Boy!

Did-did-did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh, ooh
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh,)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever, uh, uh, uh
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up?
Pretty pout, pout
(While you bottomed out out)
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
Uh, uh, uh, I'm singing

Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
B-baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
'Cause you think, you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing

Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

It's getting clear
You're never coming clean
So I'll lock you up inside
And swallow, swallow the key

[Big Sean]
Yeah. Hello?
Yeah, I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
Well, I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through
You know how we do
Some times I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A,
But the way we, the way we do is deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin' or workin', so the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well, hell, only when I'm missing you
And, hell, yeah, I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you

Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
