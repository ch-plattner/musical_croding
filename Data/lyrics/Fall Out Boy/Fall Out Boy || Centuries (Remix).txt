[Juicy J:]
Remix with the legendary Juicy J
Let's go

[Juicy J:]
With all this bread I need a bigger stomach
My name ring bells so you can here me coming
Made it all on my own, they ain't give me nothing
And I'm still standing like a set of crutches
Ain't no way they gon' forget my name
I'm a legend putting in work ever since I came
This is your umbrella, naw it can't stop my reign
You in the car pool, I'm in a different lane
I just wake up every morning and go get the change
Do my own dirty work and I won't get a stain
I'm too heavy in this game and you better know it
Hustle speaks for itself, I don't even gotta show it

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries (Let's go!)
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries (Forever!)
Hey, hey, (Yessir!) hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me (Always)
Remember me, for centuries (We ain't going nowhere)
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history (In history)
Remember me for centuries (Yeah)
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
(Real OG)

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
