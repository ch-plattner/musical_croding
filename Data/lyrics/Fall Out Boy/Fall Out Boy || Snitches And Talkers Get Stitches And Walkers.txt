Show me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid
I, I, I will break his jaw
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up
No-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
And I will save him from himself
Here's a picture with a note
"No, don't turn out like me"
It's only for your own good
No-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And haven't you heard
The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"
Get out into the sun,
Out from behind the gossip
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking
Keep this alive
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow

Hey, hey [x3]

Even when there's
N-n-n-n-nothing worth living for
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for
N-no one has to know-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
And haven't you heard
The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"
Get out into the sun
Out from behind the gossip
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking
Keep this alive
This story's getting old (This story's getting old)
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow

This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking
Keep this alive
This story's getting old (This story's getting old)
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
N-n-now, ow-ow, ow-ow [x3]

Stop!
