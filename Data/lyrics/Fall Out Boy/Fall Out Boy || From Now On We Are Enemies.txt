I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
A downward spiral just a pirouette
G-g-getting worse till there's n-n-nothing left
What good comes of something when I'm 
just the ghost of nothing (nothing)?

I'm just the man on the balcony singing:
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(for a)
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till
Till they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing: 
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"

Heralded as a king before I had a birthday
With double (double) digits (digits)
Fit the crown to my head but I was only a kid (yeah I was only a kid)
Yeah I was only a kid
(Hey)
I'm just the man on the balcony singing:
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(Oah)
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till
Till they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing:
"I only want what I can't have" [x3]
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"

I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I'm just the man on the balcony singing:
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
I'm just the man on the balcony singing:
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees

Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till
Till they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing:
"I only want what I can't have" [x3]
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"
