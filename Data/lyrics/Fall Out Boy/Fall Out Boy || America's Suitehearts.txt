You could have knocked me out with a feather.
I know you've heard this all before, but we're just Hell's neighbors.
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
In my dreams trees grow all over the streets.

But I don't know much about classic cars (cars),
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke).
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike,
Media Blitz

Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.

You can bow and pretend that
You don't, don't know you're a legend.
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet.
(..Sorry I just..) Let my love loose again.

I don't know much about classic cars (cars),
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke).
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike,
Media Blitz

Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.

You could have knocked me out with a feather
I know you've heard this all before

Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins.

Sweethearts 
Let's hear it for, let's hear it
Sweethearts 
Let's hear it for, let's
Sweethearts
