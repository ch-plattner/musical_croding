I could walk this fine line between elation and success,
but we all know which way I'm going to strike the stake between my chest.
So, "You have to prove yourself". 
You'll have to prove it to me.

So now you're waiting up for him... 
You're wasting time every time

Whoa, I can't do it by myself. [x5]

I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am:
A failure at everything... 18 going on extinct.
I know my place it's nowhere you should roam.

So now you're waiting up for him... 
Still wasting time, yeah, every time
Yeah

Whoa, I can't do it by myself. [x8]
