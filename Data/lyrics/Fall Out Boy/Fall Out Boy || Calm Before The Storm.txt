
I sat outside my front window...this story's going somewhere:
"He's well hung," and I am hanging up.
Well there's a song on the radio that says:
"Let's get this party started."
So let's get this party started.

What you do on your own time's just fine.
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.
What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted
All my oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance

You said, between your smiles and regrets: "Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone. Dead and gone.
Calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.

The next time the phone can wring my neck it gets no answer
and of the time that I've spent telling it my roots
I'm shaking in my boots
But still it looks at me like an old friend I've betrayed
the darkside of the doormat is the one your shoes have frayed

What you do on your own time's just fine. 
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.
What meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted 
All my oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance.

You said, between your smiles and regrets: "Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone. Dead and gone.
Calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.
