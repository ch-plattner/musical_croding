
Walking off that stage tonight
I know what you're thinking 
"He stands alone because he's high on himself"
But if you only knew..

I was terrified and would you mind if I 
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend 
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

The only girl who ever gave me the time 
was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
Knocking boots in the back,
How degrading is that?
I decline

I'm too terrified and would you mind if I 
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend 
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no, no
