
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Joey Bada$$:]
Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes

I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night until we're twins again
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble till find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you shrug

There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Joey Bada$$:]
Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes

A birth and a death on the same day
And honey I only appear so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day

[Joey Bada$$:]
Innie-minnie decisions who I choose to be with
Victim of superstition, won't see me in the pic booth
I'm under supervision would be damned if I slipped up
You knew my true intention but you want to keep pretending
Look I can't keep pretensin', can't even be present
Now you tryna [?]
Let the story fucking [?]
[?] go to heaven
I'm the room 47

There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
