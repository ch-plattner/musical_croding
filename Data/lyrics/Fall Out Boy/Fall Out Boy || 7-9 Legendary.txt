
I got that midnight tennis elbow
Got the solitaire rugburn
Took a turn 
An ace up my sleeve

I want to choke (u)
And get sick off of you 
Like secondhand smoke
Ya got me sweating like Calcutta nights
Such a sweet epiphany

I am a wing (wing)
I'm a prayer (prayer)
A thimble and an acorn
A promise from a poor apocathary- 
To an understudy in love forlorn

I'll give you heatstroke
I'm getting you and I'm losing me

We'd get legendary 
Tonight little darlin' 
Uh huh little darlin' 
But I've got a nomadic head
I love ya but I've caught the doom and the dread

We'd get legendary 
Tonight little darlin' 
Uh huh little darlin' 
But I've got a nomadic head
I love ya but I've caught the doom and the dread
