I am such a sucker
And I'm always the last to know
My insides are copper
And I'd kill to make them gold
Conversation got me here: another night alone in the city
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars that everything I wish for will never come true

When you go I will forget everything about you [2x]

I've seen sinking ships go down with more grace than you

Turn this up I'll tune you out
Another night alone in the city
Fake it like you matter, that's a lie we can both keep

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars that everything I wish for will never come true

When you go I will forget everything about you [2x]

I will forget (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
When you go I will forget everything about you
When you go (I will forget everything about you)

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars that everything I wish for will never come true
