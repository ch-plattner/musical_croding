
Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me, 
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me be.

I keep my jealousy close, 
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy, 
Then I'm not the only one lying.

[Chorus: x2]
Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret 
And your biggest mistake.
The hand behind this pen relives a failure every day.

And I keep my jealousy close, 
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy, 
Then I'm not the only one lying.

Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me, 
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me...

[Chorus x2]

So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down. 
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.
[x3]
[During 3rd repeat:]
(Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.)

[Chorus x3]
[comes back in during chorus 2nd time:]
(So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down. 
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.)
