
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and her boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Night's alright

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who will see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sip a little drink and shout, "She's with me"

A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Night's alright

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Night's alright
