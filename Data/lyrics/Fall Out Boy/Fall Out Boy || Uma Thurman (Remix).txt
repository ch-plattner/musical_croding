You already what it is

She wants to dance like Uma  Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman 
And I can't get you out of my head

The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh, hell, yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, oh, keep you like an oath
"May nothing but death do us part..."
I can move mountains 
I can work a miracle, work a miracle 
Oh, oh, oh, I can move mountains 
I can work a mira, I, I can move mountains

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman 
Bury me 'til I confess 
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman 
And I can't get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of a lamb
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains 
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, oh, keep you like an oath 
"May nothing but death do us part..." 
I can move mountains...
Uh, it's young Khalifa man, hehe
(I can work a miracle, work a miracle)
(Oh, oh, oh, I can move mountains)
Yeah
(I can work a mira, I, I can move mountains)

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Joint in my hand, rocking jewels 
My job, I do it too well
I take care of my crew well
I just cancelled that old show
I'm 'bout to get a new girl
My new girl is too dull
I'm Brad Pitt in The Cruel World
Ain't nothing left to do
But call your friends and bring 'em through
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
You be the teacher, I'm the student
And I can beat it up 
But just don't think that I'm abusive
I'm nothin' like her ex
I'm more exclusive than the fleshest
No bellugians, young khalifa, uh! Yup, yup, yup
Yup

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, oh,  keep you like an oath
"May nothinâ€™ but death do us part..."
I can move mountains 
I can work a miracle, work a miracle 
Oh, oh, oh, I can move mountains 
I can work a mira, I, I can move mountains

I can move mountains 
I can move mountains 
Work a miracle
I can move mountains 
Work a miracle
