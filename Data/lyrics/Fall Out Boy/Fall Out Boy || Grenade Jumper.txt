My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with.
living like life's going out of style.
And you came to watch us play...like a "Big shot talent,"
but at the end of the day you know where we come from
and where we call home.

Hey Chris, you were our only friend.
And I know this is belated, but we love you back.

They'll say it's not worth it.
So we'll leave this town in ruins.
living like life's going out of style.
And you came to watch us play...like a "Big shot talent,"
but at the end of the day you know those busted lips
we take back home.

Hey Chris, you were our only friend.
And I know this is belated, but we love you back.

I know you would be there either way.
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade.
So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me.
