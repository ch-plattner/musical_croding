[Hook x2:]
They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive

[Verse 1:]
If I was still around
Walk me through
I am your savior now
And I'm your secret too

Carry them alive
Fall off the case again
You're just a black widow
Who fell in love with herself

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
If it's never been broken
Can't believe in it
Now you're just a problem
For someone else to fix

If I was still around
If I'm near you
I am your savior, yeah
I am your secret too

[Hook]

Oh shitty crap shit...
