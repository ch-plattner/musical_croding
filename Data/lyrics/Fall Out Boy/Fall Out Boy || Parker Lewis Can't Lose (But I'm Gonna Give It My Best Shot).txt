You laughed off my affections
While I passed by your direction
I should have known from your walk, yeah
It was the end of you

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah

I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose

Taking back every step towards you
Still failing at everything I do
In the meantime just talking with my shoes
Converse with my Converse
At least they hear a word I say
And scrutinize it
Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at
Tied my tongue around my neck
For the last time

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Your quick wit lips, just tear me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah 

I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

This is the last song about you
This is the last song that I waste on you
