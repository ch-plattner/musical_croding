
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you

This is a black black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You, would never sing along
Cast them out because this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you

[UZI:]
Uzi, Fall Out Boy
Lately I've been cooking up the blue flame
And I'm hanging with the [?] do 'caine
They all tweaking at the [?]
I showed up to the party with the bling-bling
Got a new chain every single time the news change
I can never do [?] or it's too change
Judging how things turned out I'm guessing things do change
[?] like loose change
Niggas acting brand new off the new fame
Swear this shit is lame [?]
I've been getting twisted off the liquor and the champagne
Pirex [?]
All they do is ball, all you niggas small, small change
I stay with a brand new new and brand new and I'm ready to blaze

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you

Ooooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you
