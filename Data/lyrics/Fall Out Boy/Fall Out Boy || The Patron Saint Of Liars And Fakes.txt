I'm holding out and I'm holding on 
to every letter and every song.
I pulled myself out of the day we ever had to meet.
Are you through with me? 

So..

And when it all goes to hell, 
will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face.
[x2]

Let's Go!

I'm all ears and I'm all scars 
to hear you tell me "Boy's like you, you try too hard 
to look not quite as desperate". I'm hanging on. 
But I still know the way to make your makeup run.

So..

And when it all goes to hell, 
will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face.
[x3]

And when it all goes to hell, (Take this to your grave)
will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face. (I'll take it to mine)

And when it all goes to hell [x3]
And when it all goes.
