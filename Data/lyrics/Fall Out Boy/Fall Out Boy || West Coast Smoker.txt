
Wishes bounce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated
And this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right
The P.A. system keeps my heart heart beating tonight

Oh hell yes
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Come on in, the water's warm
Come on like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head
Like putting wings on lead
And your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind
And that's all that should matter t-t-to you

Follow the disorganized religion of my head
And we'll never get through customs
Let's just take off again instead
Got my degree in the gutter,
My heart broken in the dorms of the ivy league

Oh hell yes
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck huh
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset (The drugs just make me reset)
Knock once for the father (for the father)
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times
Three times for the holy ghost
