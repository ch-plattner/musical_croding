And join a monastery
Go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane (passenger plane)?

Permanent jet lag
Please take me back (please take me back)
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in (please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

It feels like fourteen carats but no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king
Goes to the desert the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said,
"We won, oh we won."

Permanent jet lag
Please take me back (please take me back)
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in (please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My, ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine now
Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine now

Only one book really matters
The rest of the proof is on the television, on the...

Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

Have you ever wanted to disappear?

[Spoken:]
It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my ego's in a sling
You said you're not listening and I said I'm wishing...
And I said... I said...
