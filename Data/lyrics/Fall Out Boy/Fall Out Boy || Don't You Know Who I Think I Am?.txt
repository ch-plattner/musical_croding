Oh oh oh oh

A penny for your thoughts but a dollar for your insights
Or a fortune for your disaster
I'm just a painter and I'm drawing a blank

We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get me just right

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

Oh oh oh oh

I could learn to pity fools as I'm the worst of all
And I can't stop feeling sorry for myself
Whoa

We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get (Get) us (us) right

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

We only want to sing you to sleep
(In your bedroom speakers, whoa whoa)
We only want to sing you to sleep

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank, and we walk the plank
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

Broken down on memory lane
Alone together, we're alone (Woah)
We're broken down on memory lane
Alone together, we're alone

Oh oh oh oh
