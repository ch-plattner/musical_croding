The king is dead (Long live the king)
The king is dead (Long live the king)
The king is dead (Long live the king)
The king is dead!

Yeah, I said lord be my savior
Please don’t, we’ve been doomed from the start
Now we’re so dismissive
So the king cannot play the part

Yeah, I said the king is dead (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said the king is dead (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah
Huh, huh

Huh

The may never think and wonder why, Dear Christ
Every time I see you I just want to paint the walls white

Yeah, I said the king is dead (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said the king is dead (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah
Dead
