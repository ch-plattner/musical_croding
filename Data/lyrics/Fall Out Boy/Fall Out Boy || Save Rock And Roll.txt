[Patrick Stump:]
Until your breathing stops (stops stops)
Until your breathing stops (stops stops)
Until your (your, your, your, your)
Forever, forever

I need more dreams
And less life
I need that dark
In a little more light
I cried tears you'll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'Yes'
I'm here to scream

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll

Until your breathing stops (stops stops)
Until your breathing stops (stops stops)
Until your (your, your, your, your)
Forever, forever

[Elton John:]
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence for the voice of our generation

[Patrick Stump:]
Whoa, how'd it get to be only me?
Like I'm the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes

[Patrick Stump & Elton John:]
I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
That we can't stop singing

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll

(Forever, forever)

[4x:]
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh

(Until your breathing stops, stops, stops)
(Until your breathing stops, stops, stops)
(Until your, your, your, your, your)
(Forever, forever)

[Elton John:]
You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'Yes'
I'm here to scream

[Patrick Stump & Elton John:]
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

[6x:]
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh

[Elton John 2x:]
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in, save rock and roll
