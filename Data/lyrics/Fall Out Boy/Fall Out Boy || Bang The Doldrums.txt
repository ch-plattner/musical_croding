I wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
When you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

[x2:]
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

This city says...

Come hell or high water
Well I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

[x2:]
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

The tombstones were waiting
They were half-engraved
They knew it was over
Just didn't know the date

And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers

Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

[x2:]
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
