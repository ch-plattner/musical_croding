But there's no one I'd rather waste 
My time with than all my best friends 
So start that car up

We'll all take turns, but not for the worst 
We're all has-beens and never-weres 
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne" 
Just watching life pass us by, pass us by

As if we cared enough to try to catch up 
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah

We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging around 
Tip your glasses to no direction, yeah 
Start the van up, get me out of this one horse town 
Waste this night

We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging around 
Tip your glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van, get me out of this one horse town 
Waste this night, waste this night

We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging around 
Tip your glasses to no direction
Start the van, get me out of this one horse town 
Waste this night
