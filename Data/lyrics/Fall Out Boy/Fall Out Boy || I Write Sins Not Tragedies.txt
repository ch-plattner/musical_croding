Well imagine,
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor,
And I can't help but to hear,
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:

"What a beautiful wedding! What a beautiful wedding," says a bridesmaid to the waiter,
"And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore."

I'd chime in with a,

I'd chime in, 
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"

With a sense of poise and rationality.
I'd chime in,
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of
Poise and Rationality!

I'd chime in,
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality.
I'd chime in,
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of
Poise and Rationality! Again...
