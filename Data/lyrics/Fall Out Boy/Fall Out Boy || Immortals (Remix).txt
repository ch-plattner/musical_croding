They say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t

Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t

Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals
And if we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down

[Black Thought:]
They got a lot of hate for me
They tryna keep heaven's gates open late for me
I see the way the wolves salivate for me
If I don't make it home, baby don't wait for me
Shit, there was a murder up in Harlem
I heard there was a riot down Georgia
Out in Michigan to Watts, California
God Bless Ferguson, Baltimore
Chaos and less order, we could be immortal
It's already gon' be another martyr
It's already gon' be another murder
The nature of the monster we're a part of
Say a little prayer for your son, for your daughter
Do a Hail Mary then run for the border
Where I come from, my whole life span shorter
I got stress disorder
Be immortal

Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals
