[2 Chainz:]
Yeah
Okay
Fire

Whoa

[Verse 1:]
Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Bridge:]
My songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus:]
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire [x2]

Whoa
In the dark-dark
Whoa
In The dark-dark

[Verse 2:]
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - 2 Chainz:]
Yeah
2 Chainz!
Light it up
I'm so hot, I'm getting head in a fire truck
She like when I buy her stuff
No strings attached, she want me to tie her up
She ask how much money I got
I told her "Not enough"
"Do Not Disturb" sign on my hotel
So many girls on my, on my coattails
I told them it's a new day, a new way to get it
I told them "Turn over, I got a new way to hit it"
You know I gotta get it, I ain't lying to ya
Stand close to me, I'll put fire to ya
Self-medication, I take one to the head
And I ain't chasing nothing

[Repeat Chorus]

Whoa

[Repeat Chorus]

Whoa
