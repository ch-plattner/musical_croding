
I'm so in love
I'm still in love

I've never been in love quite before
until I saw your face
and watching stars without you
my soul cries
my hething heart
is full of pain
when we're apart
the aching

I'm kissing you
I'm kissing you

You're my father
you're my soldier
you protect me, boy you save me
you're my best friend
you're my husband
you are my doctor, counselor,
provider, professor, my everything

And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I love you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you, with every ounce of me
Just teach me, boy teach me, just take me

When we make love I can feel all your spirits
deep inside of me
Baby you're so pure

I'm Kissing you forever, and ever, and ever
I love Kissing you (kissing you, kissing you)

Boy I love everything about you baby
it's been so many years since we fell in love
we got something special baby
we can cry together
we can grow together
be ourselves together
and I love you more than music
yes I love you more than music

I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you oh (kissing you, kissing you)
