Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

(Turn the lights on!)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

(Turn the lights on!)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain....
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Turn the lights out
