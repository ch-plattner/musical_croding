[Music video introduction (pilot):]
Flight controller is here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction

[Verse 1:]
Your love is bright as ever (ever, ever, ever)
Even in the shadows (shadows, shadows, shadows)
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Before they turn the lights out (lights out, lights out, lights out)
Your heart is glowing (glowing, glowing, glowing)
And I'm crashing into you (into you, into you, into you)
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Verse 2:]
We don't have forever
Ooh, baby daylight's wasting (wasting, wasting, wasting)
You better kiss me (kiss me)
Before our time has run out
Mmmhh yeah...
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Oh, baby, take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Hook:]
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me boy XO
You love me like XO
All that I see
Give me everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
