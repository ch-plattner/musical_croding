
I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."

[Chris Brown:]
Queen Bey I'm trippin'
Cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off
Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning
Know I do the same shit but girl it's different
And if I can, you can't fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras
You just love making me jealous
Hanging out with your girls all night
And staying out til tomorrow
Girl you got me all kinda crazy
Sippin' all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas
Girl I'm jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
