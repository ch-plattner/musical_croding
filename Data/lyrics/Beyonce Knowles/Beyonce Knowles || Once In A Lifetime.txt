
This is just another day that I would spend 
Waitin' for the right one. 
Staring at the night and wishin' I could be the one 
To feel the warm sun. 
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake 
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes 
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready) 
I could never need you more than now 

You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
Hold on to me tight 
For once in my life 
You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
This kind of love you'll only find 
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime 

Tell me that your living in a place 
Where no one else can find you. 
Tell me that your sanging out my name, 
Hoping that I'll hear you. 
Tell me "No" and I'll fade away, 
But this is lovin that I won't waste 
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready) 
I could never need you more than now 

You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
hold on to me tight 
For once in my life 
You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
This kind of love you'll only find 
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime 

What are the words, I'm needin' to hear 
How do I know if I'll ever love again 
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear 
And I will never be the same 

You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
hold on to me tight 
For once in my life 
You were worth waiting for 
You the one that I adore 
This kind of love you'll only find 
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
