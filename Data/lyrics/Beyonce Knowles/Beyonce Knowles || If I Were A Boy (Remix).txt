[Beyonce:]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted, and I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[R. Kelly:]
If you were a boy
Then, girl, you'd understand
You need to stop listenin' to your friends
Love, respect, and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out, as long as I'm comin' home to you
And give you the world

But you're not a boy
So you don't have a clue
How I work and pay the bills
How everything I do is for you
[Beyonce:]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Beyonce (R. Kelly):]
If I were a boy (If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone (I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone (Girl you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

[R. Kelly:]
But you're not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man
[Beyonce:]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed (Said I'm sorry)

[Beyonce:]
It's a little too late for you to come back
[R. Kelly:]
But I can't let you go, 'cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy...
