[Verse 1 - Beyonce:]
I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
You're still so fine
All mine...
All mine...
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh

Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far...
If we are...
We're taking this a little too far...
Baby if we are...
We're taking this a little too far...

With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...

[Hook 1 - Drake:]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
What's up

[Verse 2 - Beyonce:]
On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom...
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is...
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Hook:]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you...
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Let's get carried away...
Come right now you know where I stay...

[Hook 2 - Drake & Beyoncé:]
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
All I'm really asking for is you...
Your mine, your mine
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
Long as you know who you belong to...

[Hook 1 - Drake:]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
What's up

[Verse 3 - Drake:]
Oh... from 8 until late I think bout you
You're on my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way to deep and we should

[Pre-Hook:]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you...
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Let's get carried away...
Come right now you know where I stay...

[Hook 2 - Drake & Beyoncé:]
I just wanna say your mine, your mine

All dem fives needa listen when the 10 is talkin
Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all your friends and that's been a problem
You the one they hate this come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a runnin back
But that nigga came runnin back

Long as you know who you belong to...

[Outro:]
All I'm really asking for is you
