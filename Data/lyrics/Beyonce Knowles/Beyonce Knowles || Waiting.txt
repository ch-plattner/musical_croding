Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting ooh
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away

And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day

I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait

12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them
No

I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!

I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your aps in the bar is in my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting [x4]
I'm waiting

I'll be waiting
I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

I'll be waiting
I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I wait right here for you

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
