Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like you can touch it, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?

Grab a hold,
Don't let go
Let me know
That you ready
I just wanna
Show you now
Slow it down
Go around
You rock hard
I rock steady

[Hook:]
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Could you put it in your face
By the way if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls

[Hook]
So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady

Don't you know that I give you
The loving if you need it
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons
Growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls down
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now
Yes lord
Damn baby
You're driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that, daddy
Even though I've been a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me please
Punish me please
Daddy what you're gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face
Yeah, hell yeah
Love me so deep
Ooh my shit's so good it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy

We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures
Consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching (what about that, what about that ching, ching)
Baby boomers (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddammit I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're
Comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, skin
Rockets 'til waterfalls
