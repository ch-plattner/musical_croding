No shorty, it's Beyonce,
We gonna' party like, it's ya birthday,
We gettin' naughty like, it's ya birthday
So put ya drink up in the air if you look sexy!

I'm the chick with the hot ish, manolo blahnik,
Jimmy choo kicks, killin' it, who you with?
Me & my girls at the party with the diamonds and ice
I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body.
I'm that fly chick 5*6 Marc Jacob mini
Ghetto fabulous, glamorous, its effortless
Make up light, we with my pastel Louis
Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci

You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub,
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug,
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love,
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug.

My nails my hair my diamond rings,
Shining with all my fancy things,
My crib my car my clothes my jewels,
Why you mad? Cause I came up and I ain't changed.

I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls,
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Banks and Biddle
Ya feeling my style, ya feeling my flow
Hair sheek, smells sweet, like coco de fleur?
I'm the lady sipping baileys while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me I just send them a bottle
I know I got it but don't flaunt it even though brothers want it,
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirting, 'cause he' checkin' up on me.
