[Lil' Flip talking]
Ladies and gentlemen!
This is the remix, Houston's finest
Lil' Flip, Beyonce holla at 'em

[Lil' Flip]
Posted up in the back of the party girl
'cause I don't wanna good girl,I wanna naughty girl
I like ya style and ya body girl
And we can leave the spot in my Maserati girl
anything you need I got it girl
cause I'm connected my game perfected
I'm reppin Texas everytime I spitt
this ain't a one night stand I wanna make you my chick (yea)

[Beyonce]
You're sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
Feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel you're energy
You're vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythms got me feelin' so crazy babe

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Tonight I'll be you're naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
we gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Beyonce]
I'm feelin sexy I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I just might take you home with me
baby the minute I feel you're energy
you're vibe's just taken over me
start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythms got me feelin' so crazy babe

[Chorus]

[Beyonce]
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a tell you what I like,you can tell me what you like
'cause it ain't no thing for me to book you a flight(Uh)
or better yet we can charter a jet
I'll take you to foreign countries that you ain't been yet(Uh)
after a month I know ya feelings gettin stronger
'cause when we on the phone now we conversate longer
You know I want ya,I ain't playin wit ya mind
I just wanna spend time,if that's cool
I'm fighting Temptations cause ain't nobody like you
I like ya belly ring and that cute tattoo
I make moves like the boss on the low
so holla at Lil' Flip when you ready to roll (woah!)


[Chorus - repeat to end]
