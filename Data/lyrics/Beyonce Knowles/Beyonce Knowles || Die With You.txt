I don't have a reason to cry, and I have every reason to smile.
And I don't have a reason to lie, when you're already reading my mind.
And I don't have a reason to be, if I can't be with you.

And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can't sing your song.
No I don't need hands, if I don't get to keep you warm.
And I don't really need myself, if I don't need you.

'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,
I open my eyes so I can see with you,
and I live so I can die with you.

And I don't really need these fingers, if I don't get to touch your spine.
No I don't need these legs, if I ain't walkin' by your side.
And I don't really need to be, if I can't be with you.

'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,
I open my eyes so I can see with you,
and I live so I can die with you.

'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,
I open my eyes so I can see with you,
and I live so I can die with you.
