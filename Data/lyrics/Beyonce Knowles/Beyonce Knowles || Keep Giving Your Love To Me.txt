[P. Diddy]
Ay yo B This a good look right here Yeah Bad Boy baby Uh ay yo B

[Beyonce]
[Verse 1:]
I been wantin' to explain to you
what it is that you do to me
Got me open I am so in love with lovin' you
Touch in places no one else has 
ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me I feel sexy 
No one else like you

[Bridge:]
Got me goin' off all the love you give me (you give me)
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands alone run by me (touch me)
Please don't say your gonna stop lovin' me (so keep on)

[Chorus:]
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)
When you givin' yor love to me (oh)
It's like you makin' love to me (oh)
[Repeat]

[Verse 2:]
I loose all control when you are here
and baby it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy 
and love like you do
Baby do you understand the power that you possess over me
Can't escape this feeling and I don't think I want to 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

It's crazy how much I'm in love with you
It's all cause you love me the way you do
Don't want no other love but you 
Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good

[Chorus]

Makin' love to me 
Makin' love to me
Makin' love to me
Makin' love to me
Makin' love to me
Me 
Me
