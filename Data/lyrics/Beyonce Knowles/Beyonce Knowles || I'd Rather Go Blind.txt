Something told me it was over (yeah)
When I saw you and her talking.
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry, girl." (cry girl)
When I saw you and that girl walking around woo ooh.

[Chorus:]
I would rather,
I would rather go blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no, woo ooh.

So you see I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all I just don't,
I just don't wanna be free now, woo, ooh.

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed these tears that are all on my face, woo, ooh

And, baby, and, baby, baby,
I'd rather be blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away,
Walk away from me, yeah
[Repeat]
