Took me a while 
But I'm finally here 
So I just wanna testify 
Make it crystal clear 
See I've been picked out 
To be picked on 
talked bout outta me friends mouth 
I've been beat down 
Til he turned my life around 
(turn my life around) 

seems like I always fall short 
of bein worthy 
Cuz I aint good enough 
but he still loves me 

I aint no superstar 
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
(no no no no no) 
cuz I aint good enough 
but he still loves me 
Loves me 

I used to wake up somedays 
and wish i'd stayed asleep 
cuz i went to bed on top of the world 
today the worlds on top of me 
everybody's got opinions 
(they share) 
They aint been in my position 
(they don't care) 
that it breaks my heart when I hear what they 
have to say about me yeah 
(what they say) 

seems like I always fall short (fallin short) 
of bein worthy (Lord I aint worthy) 
Cuz I aint good enough (no no) 
but he still loves me (still loves me) 

I aint no superstar 
I wanna be for you 
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
(but i want to be for you) 
cuz I aint good enough 
but he still loves me 

I'm not perfect 
(I'm not perfect) 
Yes I do wrong 
(yes I do wrong) 
I'm trying my best 
(trying my best but) 
But it aint good enough 
(just aint good enough) 
Shunned by the world 
(shunned by the world) 
If I don't succeed 
Cuz I aint good 
But he still loves me 
(I just aint good enough) 

If you aint worthy just raise your hands 
And let me know that you understand 
That we are all so blessed 
To be loved, loved 

stand for him or fall for anything 
cuz through his eyes we all look the same 
What will we do 
Without out pain 

Feels like we always fall short 
Of bein worthy (we are not worthy) 
Cuz I aint good enough 
But he still loves me 
I aint no superstar 
(I aint no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord) 
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
Cuz I aint good enough 
(Oh) 
But you still love me 

I'm not perfect 
Yes I do wrong 
I'm tryin my best but 
(tryin my best) 
It aint good enough 
(I'm not good enough) 
Shunned be the word 
(shunned by the world) 
If i dont succeed 
(i dont succeed-ceed-ceed) 
Cuz I aint good enough 
But he still loves me 
(child sing with me) 
I'm not perfect 
Yes I do wrong 
I'm tryin my best but 
It aint good enough 
(But the Lord's been so good to me) 
Shunned be the word 
(Shunned by the world) 
If i dont succeed 
Cuz I aint good enough 
(I aint good enough) 
But he still loves me 
(The Lord still loves me) 

No I aint good enough 
But He still loves me 
(Raise your hands if ya understand) 
No I aint good enough 
(How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too) 
but He still loves me 
(even though I aint worthy) 
No I aint good enough 
(you aint worthy, He's there for you) 
but He still loves me 
(no matter what I do) 
No I aint good enough 
(I aint good enough) 
but he still loves me 
(but the Lord still loves me)
