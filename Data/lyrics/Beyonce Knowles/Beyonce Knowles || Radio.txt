I be on the hotline, like erryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh 
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room 
With the door closed we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go BOOM
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out of my window 
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
(With my stereo-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing OH!
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ
(Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart.....

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

I be on the hotline, like erryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh 
Turn up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Oh ooh whoa whoa...
Oh ooh whoa whoa...
Oh ooh whoa whoa, ooh.......
