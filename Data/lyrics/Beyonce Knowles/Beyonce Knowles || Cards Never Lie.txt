[Beyonce] - The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
and now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
and I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven

I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown of the ground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards
You might start
Returning to your vision

[Wyclef] - Oh Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, But you must fear divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind

Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

[Beyonce] - No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

[Rah Digga] - Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
and probably should be older

[Wyclef] - But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her time to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the light

[Beyonce] - This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

[Wyclef] - But when you finally rise
Then you'll realize

[Beyonce] - The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

[Wyclef] - Oh You could wish on the stars but they dead, just a light

[Beyonce] - But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
