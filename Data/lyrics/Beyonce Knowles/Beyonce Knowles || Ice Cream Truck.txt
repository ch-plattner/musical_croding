[Verse 1:]
Alright, Alright
Feel like I'm losing me mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe
You belonged to me, oh
And always through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish

[Bridge 1:]
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know you're not what I need
Let me go, let me do Bey

[Chorus:]
You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always outta love
And my heart just melts
[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Hey
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I caught up
I'm chasing you again, finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized your flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holding on
Looked and I was gone

[Bridge 2:]
The next time you drop on by
No matter hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know you're not what I need
Let me go, let me do Bey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You got me chasing you
I try my luck, I can't catch up
Cause you got me chasing you
My heart's melting, it's like ice cream
[x2]

[Bridge 3: Over chorus]
I've been chasing after you
Now it's time to let you go
Yes I tried time and time again
But you don't love me, it's go to end
I tried so hard, damn near lost my mind
Cause real love is hard to find
Now my heart can't take no more
Now I know boy you ain't mine
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
