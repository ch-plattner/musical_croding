Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same
As last night
And it just don't feel
Right anymore

That we should break up
There's no reason
To make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired
And I need a change

Sorry Boy But You've
Got me bored
And something
Cathing my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while

I gotta
Switch em out [4x]

Kick him out [4x]
Woahoooah, ooh

I know that you
Treat me right
But still I think I gotta
Make u my next ex

And I think you're nice
But I saw something else
That I like
I really think I gotta
Make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ooooh

You call me
Too frequently
I thought it was
So sweet
In the beginning
But now You're too clingy 
For me
You don't put the 
Seat down
You don't clean the house
How I like it,(tryfling)
That's reason enough
You're time's expired

Sorry Boy But you've 
Got me bored

Around

Gotta ring by now
