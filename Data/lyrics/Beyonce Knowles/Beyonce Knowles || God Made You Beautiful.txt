When you were born
The angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight

You took the breath
And the world was right again
Tears were shed
How we have been blessed

And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful
Beautiful, you're beautiful

Well look at me
You were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet
And watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes
The world stops in your eyes
I found love
I found peace with the purest kind

And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got that light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

Thank God
(I get on my knees and pray)
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
God made you beautiful

God made you beautiful
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
God made you beautiful
Beautiful, you're beautiful
