
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away

And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change

[Chorus:]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul

So let it show, So let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control [x8]

I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't relieve
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold

[Chorus:]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul

So let it show, So let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all

Control

Nothing ventured nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath you take me away

[Chorus:]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul

So let it show, So let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control [x8]
