[Intro: Beyonce]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook: Beyonce]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Hook: Beyonce]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (yeah)
I'm-a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
If you're thirsty and in love just hit your boy
I'm your milk man at your door
When you phone me I can see you with your cup
I'm just role playing
(Must be good to you)

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Interlude: Beyonce]
I'm about to get into this, girls
This is for all the grown women out there

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Ooh I've had a naughty thought today, baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Donâ€™t slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe
I know everything you want
I'm-a show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bring ya work home on top of me
I'm-a let you be the, be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

[Bridge]

[Pre-Outro:]
Je ne sais quoi
Cherie, m'vle-ou
Aswe ya ce net al kole!

[Pre-Hook + Outro Hook]
