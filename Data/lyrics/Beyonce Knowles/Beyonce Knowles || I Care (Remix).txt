[David Jassy:]
 Love is patient and kind.
Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude.
It does not demand its own way.
It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.
It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.
Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. 

[Beyonce:]
I told you how your hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
But you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care, well that's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la

Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour
You won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care? That's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you've just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[David Jassy:]
 Is it really love or is it just an illusion, or maybe you just going through a phase of confusion, 
baby i still care even though you showing me the opposite, 
I stay on top of it avoid the topic of apocalypse, 
I've been monogamous locked in like shellfish, 
while you've been acting like a fisherwoman...sell fish, 
uh you're so immune to my pain,
either that or you just playing the game
