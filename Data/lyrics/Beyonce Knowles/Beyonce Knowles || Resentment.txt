I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me

I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinking
What's up with b
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying
Can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
Look at what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
You lied
How could you lie
You lied
