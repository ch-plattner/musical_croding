
How you doing honey baby
You know I don't ask for much but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I hear a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

[Chorus:]
Is y'all alright 
I don't know but I know what's happening to me girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now

See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

Child, blow your horn now
Come on, Child, blow your horn now

So we shakin back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to, you got to keep on strumming babe
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time
We if there ain't nobody loving and you goin keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine

[Chorus]

I like this!
Uh, look it here...BRIDGE!

So baby hold me 
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy
Cause boy you working it out
Daddy you given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole bee hive
I'm gonna call you my sugar 
Cause I (I) had the sweetest time
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

I like it when the horn go [x4]

Ha! Austin better work it out
Ha! Foxy better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
