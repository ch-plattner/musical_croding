[Intro:]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1:]
I kiss you when you lick your lips, (I kiss you and you lick your lips)
You like it wet and so do I, (You like it wet and so do I)
No you never waste a drip, (No you never waste a drip)
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook:]
(Keep me coming, keep me going), keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning), keep me humming, keep me moaning
(Non-stop love until the morning), Non-stop love until the morning
(Non-stop screaming, freakin', blowin') Blow-o-o

[Hook:]
Can you eat my skittles
It's the sweetest in the middle
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle

I'm a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2:]
When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up till I'm empty baby
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, I'll fill it up to the top, baby
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

I'm about to get into this girls,
This is for all my grown women out there

[Bridge:]
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)

[Verse 3:]
Ooh I had a naughty thought today baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
You see it here, Lift it up toss it babe
I know everything you want
I'm a show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bring your work home on top of me
I'm a let you be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

[Bridge]

Je ne sais quoi
Ch√©ri, Mvlew
Aswe a, se net al kole
