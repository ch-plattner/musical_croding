
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed [x4]

I should've been there [x4]

All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed [x4]

I should've been there [x4]

I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed [x4]

I should've been there [x4]

I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be there
