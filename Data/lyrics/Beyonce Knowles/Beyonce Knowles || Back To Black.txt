[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oooh you
You and your head high and your tears dry
Get on without your guy and I, I, I went back to a new
So far removed from all that we went through
And you and you you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked, you'll go back to black

[Hook: Andre 3000]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to, (you go back to)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I, I loved you much, it's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

[Hook: Beyonce]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to, I go back to black
