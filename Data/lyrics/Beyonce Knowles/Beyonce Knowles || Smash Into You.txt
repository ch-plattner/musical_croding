
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
And smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
Cause' I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh...

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh......

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh...I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you
