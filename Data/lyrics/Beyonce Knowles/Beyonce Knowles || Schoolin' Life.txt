Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30 somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40 somethings
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50 somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby take it to the head

Mom and dad tried to hide the world
Said, the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made them want me more
At 14 they asked me what I wanna be,
I said "Baby 21, so I'd get me a drink."

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Schoolin' life...
Oh oh oh...
Schoolin' life...

This is for them pretty somethings
Living in a fast lane, see you when you crash babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get ya out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Schoolin' life...
Oh oh oh...
Schoolin' life...

You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshalls shut this sucker down

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Oh oh oh...
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember stay relentless... oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished, yeah yeah... yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Yea
Yea
Yea
