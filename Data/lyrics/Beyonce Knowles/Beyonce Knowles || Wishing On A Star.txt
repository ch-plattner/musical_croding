
Ooh
Ooooooh.
Star.
Star.
I'm wishing.
I'm wishing.
On a star.

[Chorus:]
I'm wishing on a star.
To follow where you are.
I'm wishing on a dream.
To follow what it mean.
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rains never comes.
And I'm wishing on the other things we never done.

[Verse:]
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be.
So far away from home.
So far away from me.
Just think of all the moments that we spent.
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant.
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know.
In the game of love, you reap what you sow.
(So-o-o-o-w)

[Breakdown:]
I feel it's time we should make up baby.
I feel it's time for us to get back together.
And make the best of things, oh baby.
When we're together.
Whether or never.
I feel it's time we should make up baby.
I feel it's time for us to get back together.
And make the best of things, oh baby.
When we're together.
Let's get together, baby.
Whether or never.

[Chorus 2:]
I'm wishing on a star.
To follow where you are.
I'm wishing on a dream.
To follow what it means.
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.
Hoping all the days to come and days to go.
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so.

[Bridge:]
Baby, forgive me.
Lets make up, I'm sorry.
Lets be together, breakup?
Never.
The love we have seems special so far
Til we get back from wishing on a star.
