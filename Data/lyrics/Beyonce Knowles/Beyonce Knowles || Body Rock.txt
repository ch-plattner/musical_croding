Turn the lights down low 
take your time with me put it on me deep or slow
lay back and let your hands find every secret spot of mine calling me
let the candles blow will I'm rocking your body from head to toe 
You can watch my silhouette flow on the wall it can be you private picture show  

(Body rock) Put it all on me!
(body rock) spread it all over yeah
(body rock rock rock) give it all to me
(body rock) baby bring it on
(Body Rock) put it all on me
(body rock) don't hold back on me boy
(body rock rock rock) don't leave me hungry 
body rock) baby bring it on

Baby hold me close
cause I wanna feel every move fa' sho 
the experience,
back to back [x3]
one, two, three, four, five
till I can't take no more
six then we move to the floor
seven, eight, nine, ten ooh.

(Body rock) Put it all on me!
(body rock) spread it all over boy
(body rock rock rock) give it all to me
(body rock) baby bring it on
(Body Rock) put it all on me
(body rock) don't hold back on me no
(body rock rock rock) don't leave me hungry
(body rock) baby bring it on

Oh Oh Oh [x4]
