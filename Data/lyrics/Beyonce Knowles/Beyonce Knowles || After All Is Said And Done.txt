[Beyonce]
Here I am
Looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer
I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh

[Marc]
There you are
Always strong when I need you
You let me give
And now I live, fearless and protected
With the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done

[Beyonce (Marc)]
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)
But now I'm not afraid to say

[Beyonce & Marc]
I need you, I need you so stay with me

[Beyonce (Marc)]
These precious (precious) hours (yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow

[Beyonce & Marc]
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done

[Beyonce (Marc)]
(Yeah baby) Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)

[Beyonce & Marc (Marc)]
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here

[Beyonce]
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on

[Beyonce & Marc (Beyonce)]
We found our happy ending
For there's only love (only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done

[Marc (Beyonce)]
Yeah baby after all is (all is)

[Marc & Beyonce]
All is said and done
