Hey Honey
Cat Got Ya Tongue 
Don't Look So Funny
Mr. Comedian Jokes On You And
You Good At Bet So Where's My Money
I Know You Bet That I'd Never Make Move
So Whys The House Empty 
Lights Off By The End Of This Week
I Leave Wit Wat I Came Wit Baby
I Take The Dogs You Keep The Mercedes

Cause I'm gone I'm not fazed 
I walk these roads with grace 
And I'll wave with you behind me 
With a new smile on my face 

Cause I'm walking in new shoes now 
I got a new song to sing 
When I walk in the room every head turns 
Every eye is on me 
To bad you're not here to see it 
And by the time you get this 
I'll be so long gone and far 
I'll send you a postcard 
Aaha I'll send you a postcard 

Hey baby 
You seen a ghost? 
This ain't yo lady 
This is the chick that you held back  
Now all of the things you've said were crazy 
I checked out my list and I feel good about it 
I got the new haircut 
The one that you said wouldn't look no good 
Took that job you said I could not get 
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit 

Cause you're gone and I'm great 
I got rid of your dead weight 
And I'll wave at you behind me 
With a new smile on my face 
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now 
I got a new song to sing 
When I walk in the room every head turns 
Every eye is on me 
To bad you're not here to see it 
And by the time you get this 
I'll be so long gone and far 
I'll send you a postcard
