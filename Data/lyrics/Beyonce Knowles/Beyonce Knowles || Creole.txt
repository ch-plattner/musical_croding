That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking

exotically tempting
familiar to me
That Creole Sexy it's all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor
and all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and call it Creole

Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good
whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE

And all of my red bones that make a good sauce
