[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Let me give you the 2014 talk, my girl like Beyonce, me too
This what me and her be doin in the back of the Maybach when we listenin to Beyonce
Listen!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)
Blind your rear view mirror with the end of my sleeves (Uh Huh)
The shit that's on my wrist you probably wouldn't believe (Uh Uh)
Every symbols of success levels you couldn't achieve (AHHHH!!!)
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)
I'm alarmed at how's she's lookin and she's startin to breathe
Threw my arm and grabbed my john and now she's startin to squeeze (WOO!)
She dropped to her knees (Uh Huh) fulfillin my needs (Uh Huh)
She swallowed my seeds (Uh Huh) she's ready to go (Let's go)
Partition is up (Uh Huh) the curtains is closed (Ok!)
Mami nice with it like she played for the pros (That's Right)
She gagged from her throat, while she breathe from her nose (Oh shit!)
She startin to choke (Uh Huh) she curlin her toes 
Look how she tryin to take it off now, come out your clothes (That's Right)
I waited for a second now I thought for a minute
Ain't no lovin good enough to give her while I'm up in it (Tell 'em B!)

[Interlude: Beyonce (Busta Rhymes)]
Driver roll up the partition please
Driver roll up the partition please (Azealia BANKS!)

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Stress leveled the sex better the sex wetter
Check chatterer etcetera etcete
Bet bet you could get seven then left at it
Slept slept and I crip crep in the six seven
These niggas be puffin they piff in the public
They diggin and lustin they filmin and struttin she hittin the button
I dip in the function I'm prissy I'm pumpin
The tit and the rump and I'm flippin I'm dumpin I'm trickin I'm trumpin them
But these niggas wanna spend they cheese, tell 'em hit up lil' Miss A.Z.
Very heavy headed to take heed, I'm a flip out if a bitch play me (If a bitch play me)

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Driver roll up the partition please
Driver roll up the partition please, I don't need you seein 'yonce on her knees
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinskyed all on my gown
Whoa there daddy daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh baby baby we better slow it down
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even 'gon make it to this club

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like is right here with me
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)

[Verse 4: Beyonce]
Driver roll up the partition fast
Driver roll up the partition fast, over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin, he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red whine drip we'll talk that trash, chauffeur eavesdroppin tryin not to crash
Whoa there daddy daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh baby baby we better slow it down
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even 'gon make it to this club

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like is right here with me
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)

[Bridge:]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire, I'activite' physique, le coit, Tu aimes ca?
Tu nu t'interesses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les feministes destestent le sexe mais c'est
Une activite tres stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like is right here with me
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)
