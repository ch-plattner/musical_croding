
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life,
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side,
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today,
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away.

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me,
I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today,
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.

From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee,
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston
To New York to L.A.,
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me,
I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today,
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me,
I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today,
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
