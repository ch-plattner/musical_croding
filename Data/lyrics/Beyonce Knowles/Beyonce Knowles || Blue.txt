[Verse 1:]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

[Hook:]
Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

[Verse 2:]
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's just live it up

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge 2x:]
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on, a hold on to me

[Hook]

[Outro â€” Blue Ivy:]
Hold on to me, hold on
Bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay
Mommy mommy mommy!
Can we see daddy?
Can we see daddy?
Miss you daddy...
