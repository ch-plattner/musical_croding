[Beyonce]
Sweetness flowing like a faucet 
Body bangin' no corset 
Brothas wanna toss it 
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit 
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse is 
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless 
I'll stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features 
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches 
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches 
I see you looking at, but what you looking at? 
You're in a bar and wanna twist me like a bottle cap? 

[Mos Def]
I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gon holla back 

[Beyonce]
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back 
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac 
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that 

[Mos Def]
But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering 

[Sarpong]
And I'm Nathanile

[Mos Def]
Mel Gibson 

[Sarpong]
Danny Gloverin' 

[Beyonce] 
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling 
See, I have dreams, and with a man, what will become of them? 
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe 
I should postpone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve? 
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down 

[Mos Def]
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial 

[Sarpong]
Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now 

[Beyonce]
Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style 

[Chorus] 
[Mos Def] - Ayo, I'm trying to get with you shorty 
[Beyonce] - But I'm not feeling you 
[Sarpong] - But I'm an officer shorty 
[Beyonce] - My looks are killing you 
[Mos Def] - Murder One will get you under the covers 
[Beyonce] - Game taller, manslaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas 
[Mos Def] - Ayo, I'm trying to get with you shorty 
[Beyonce] - But I'm not feeling you 
[Sarpong] - But I'm an officer shorty 
[Beyonce] - My looks are killing you 
[Mos Def] - Murder One will get you under the covers 
[Beyonce] - Game taller, manslaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas 

[Beyonce]
Eyes like the ocean 

[Mos Def]
Ma, I got some lotion 
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you 

[Beyonce]
Hair like forever 

[Sarpong]
Swear I do it better 
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta 

[Beyonce]
Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that cat... 

[Mos Def]
Don't waste your time, he ain't worth doing, he's just a Sergeant 
Passing out tickets for parking 

[Sarpong]
Chicken-heads clucking 

[Beyonce]
Pitiful bulls barking 
See, this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin 
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking 
Girls steady jealous, cause they men always hawkin' 
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind, too 
I wouldn't bless you, 
if your first name was hachoo on Sunday, singin' gospel 

[Mos Def]
You ain't a dyme, just a nickel actin' hostile

[Beyonce]
I'm headed for the big top and bouncin' on this side-show...
