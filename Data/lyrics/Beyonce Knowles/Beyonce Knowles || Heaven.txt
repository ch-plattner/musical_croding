[Verse 1:]
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

[Hook:]
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

[Verse 2:]
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

[Hook x2]

So go on, go home

[Outro:]
Padre Nuestro
Que est√°s en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen
[English translation:
Our Father
Who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it in heaven
Amen]
