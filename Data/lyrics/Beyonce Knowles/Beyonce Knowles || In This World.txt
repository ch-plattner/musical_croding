
In this world
Of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm so glad there is you

In this world
Of all the rated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This world so new
I'll walk you through with you to guide me

In this world
Where many people play at love
But hardly ever stay in
I'm so glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
