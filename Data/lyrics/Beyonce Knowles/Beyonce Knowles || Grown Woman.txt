I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me - I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run news (ahh)

'Cause I put it (down like that, down like that)
And I'm making (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm moving (round like that, round like that)
When I do it (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman
I do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman (grown woman)
I do whatever I want (I do whatever I want)

They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk
'Cause I ain't pretendin'
It took a while, now I understand
Just where I'm going
I know the world and I know who I am
It's 'bout time I show it (ahh)

I'm a grown woman (grown woman)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)
I'm a grown woman (grown woman)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)

I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long

I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want {whatever it is}

I'm a grown woman
And I know that I got it (got it got it)
I'm a grown woman
Ain't got no room in her pockets
I'm a grown woman
Look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause you got a cute face
And that booty so fat

Go girl (go girl)
She got that bum (that bum)
That girl can get whatever she wants
That girl (hey girl),
She got that tight (that tight)
Them boys,
They do whatever she like

I'm a grown woman
