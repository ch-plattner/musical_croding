[Verse 1:]
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you

The death of me
Must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss,
You're snatching every bit of strength

That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

[Chorus:]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2:]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat lines

Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?

How many doses am I needin' now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

[Chorus:]
Baby, you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 3:]
It's just not my body (oh),
It's my mind you don't know how many times I told myself this can't do (can't do)
And that I don't need you
(No, I don't need you, no)

It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus:]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't wanna do

You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
