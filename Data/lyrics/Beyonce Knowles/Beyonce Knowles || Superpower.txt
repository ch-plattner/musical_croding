[Verse 1:]
When the palm of my two hands, hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is, hmmm
And when my voice is screaming out, to my own ears, uh
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show ya
I guess I didn't see myself before ya
Moving forward

[Pre-Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
(Super power)
A subtle power
(Super power)
A tough love
(Super power)
Uh huh, like a shark
(Super power)
Ooh, Like a bear
A tough love

[Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve, without us
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2:]
And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
(Super power)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
(Super power)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

[Pre-Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
(Super power)
A subtle power
(Super power)
A tough love
(Super power)
Uh huh, like a shark
(Super power)
Ooh, too much to bear

[Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve, without us
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we've got plenty power
But nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

[Outro: x4]
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
