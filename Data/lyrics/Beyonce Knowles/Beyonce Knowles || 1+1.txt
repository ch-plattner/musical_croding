I got you
If I ain't got something (I don't give a damn)
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra (but I know)
One plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through ('cause baby)

We ain't got nothing without love
Darling you got enough for the both of us (so come on baby)

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all (right now baby)

Make love to me (me, me, me, me) oh, oh
Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns but I
I've been shot by you (hey)
And I don't know when I'm gon' die but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you (hey)
And I don't know much about fighting but I
I know I will fight for you (hey)
And just when I ball up my fist I realize
I'm laying right next to you baby

We ain't got nothing but love
And darling you got enough for the both of us

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all (help me let down my guard)

Make love to me (me, me, me, me) oh, oh
Make love to me (me, me, me, me)
