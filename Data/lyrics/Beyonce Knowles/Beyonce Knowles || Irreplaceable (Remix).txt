To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff yes
If I bought it nigga please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

[Beyonce]
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I could have another you in a minute
matter fact he'll be here in a minute baby
You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

[Beyonce]
So go ahead and get gone
And  call up on that chick and see if she is home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Ayo love you need to calm down over something small
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine
She a custie, word life, she love my ...
I know Keanu told worse, she saw us both in the whip
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ...
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'ma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got ... who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'ma do these dishes and wash my ... cus I ain't gotta lie to you

[Beyonce]
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I wont shead a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

[Hook]

[Chorus 2X]
