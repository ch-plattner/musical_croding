[Verse 1]
My body is magnified
In the sun set me alight
My body, and your delights
Burn me up, set me alight

[Bridge]
I can't deny, your desire
Feel like Iâ€™m on fire
When you touch me
I feel the flame, baking up my feet, ohhhhhhh

[Chorus]
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel it all over it
You and me, standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Make you feel all my good loving
You and me, standing on the sun

Standing on the sun 
Standing on the sun
Standing on the sun
Standing on the sun

[Verse 1]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
