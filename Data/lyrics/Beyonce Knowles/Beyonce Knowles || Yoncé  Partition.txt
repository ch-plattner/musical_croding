[Verse 1:]
See me up in the club with 50-leven girls
Posted in the back diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin' babe

[Breakdown:]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin' babe [x2]
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (how it's looking)
And tell me how I'm lookin', babe (lookin' babe)

[Verse 2:]
Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up, " I just go slower
High like treble, puffin' on them mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor [x4]
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor [x3]
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

[Beat switch]
Drop!

[Verse 3:]
Driver roll up the partition please [x2]
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Luwinski'd all on my gown

Whoa dere daddy, daddy didn't bring a towel
Oh, baby, baby we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook:]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

[Verse 4:]
Driver roll up the partition fast [x2]
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Hand prints and footprints on my glass
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip filth talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping tryin' not to crash

Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' on my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Hello!

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe. Je veux dire, l'activité physique.
Le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe,
Mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.
[English translation:]
Do you like sex?
Sex. I mean, the physical activity.
Coitus. Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
