[Verse 1:]
Babe
Gotta to know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A Girl like me see I don't play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me go all the way
Do what you got to do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake, tell me

[Chorus:]
What's good with you baby (wanna get to know me)
What's really good baby (do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
What's good with you baby (what's you good with you baby)

[Verse 2:]
Babe
You sittin over there tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, No Noo!
Where do we go
What this thing could be we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go, Tell me

[Chorus:]
What's good with you baby (wanna get to know me)
What's really good baby (do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
What's good with you baby (what's you good with you baby)

[Bridge:]
Don't try playin with my mind
Boy I don't have no time
For something that I know ain't good for me
Don't hesitate to say
You feel the chemistry
Wanna know should I take a chance with you

[Chorus:]
What's good with you baby (Ohh wanna get to know me)
What's really good baby (Heey do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
What's good with you baby (what's you good with you baby)

What's good with you baby (Ooh wanna get to know me)
What's really good baby (Ooh do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (Woo Ohh where you from and where you be)
What's good with you baby (what's really good baby)

What's good with you baby
What's really good baby
Been near the hood lately
What's good with you baby
