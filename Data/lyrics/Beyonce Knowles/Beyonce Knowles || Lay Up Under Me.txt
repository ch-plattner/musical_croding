Don't you worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you,
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face,
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend

Part of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Takin time out, starting with today,
For my babe!

[Chorus:]
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'm a DJ all of your songs
Don't you worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Eh, boy if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
It's just you and me all night,
Don't worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!
I'll model sexy pictures right on top of you,
Ten years together still feels like we're making love for the first time,
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend!

All of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today,
For my babe!

[Chorus:]
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'm a DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!
[x2]

Boy if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight,
Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uhu, just let me look at you!
Uhu, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!
All unwrapped and on it's way
When I'm groove with you
Oh, you'll feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay up under me!

[Chorus:]
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
I'm a DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
While I'm a DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!
