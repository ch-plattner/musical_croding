[Intro]
To be or not to be
Not

Hold Up, bring the beat back

Stop, I ain't ready yet

Wait, let me fix my hair (yes, yes)

Yes mam (yes mam) Yes

[Verse 1]
I think I'm ready
Been locked up in the house way too long,
It's time to get it,
Cause once again he's out doing wrong,
And my girls are so real,
Said it's been a minute since I had some
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one

(Oh) Cause when he acts wrong (Oh) that's when you put it on,
(Oh) Been on him up tight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Hold out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

[Chorus]
Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh Every woman got one Oh Shut it down when the time's come
Oh Pull out the big gun Oh and put your freakum dress on

[Verse 2]
Soon as you saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right
Short and backless (backless, backless)
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice
Little did he know, Ha my man gonna take it off tonight

(Oh) Cause when he act up (Oh) that's when you put it on,
(Oh) Been on him up tight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Hold out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

[Chorus]
Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh Every woman got one Oh Shut it down when the time's come
Oh Pull out the big gun Oh and put your freakum dress on

All the ladies (oh) you with this and you're dressed up in your dresses,and you're bestest with no reason?
Get ready to freakum dress em

When you put it on it's an invitation, when they play your the song get on up and shake it,
Work it out on your man you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and [2x]

(Oh) Cause when he acts wrong (Oh) that's when you put it on,
(Oh) Been on him up tight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Hold out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh put your freakum dress on Oh put your freakum dress on
Oh Every woman got one Oh Shut it down when the time's come
Oh Pull out the big gun Oh and put your freakum dress on

Ladies look here, when you been with your man for a long time (oh)
Every now and then you gotta go back in the closet and pull out that freakum dress (oh) uh,
