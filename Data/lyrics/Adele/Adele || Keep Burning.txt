
Better know that summer is over
I'm not gonna tell if you don't 
Rather wear the sea on my shoulders
Than trust my old umbrella and junk

As the pavement sinks
Autumn rings
Feel my limb 
Heart than sing

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep

Callin' for the winner coke find me
Ship me back to Florence tonight
Draggin' all my mirrors behind me
Which I will never get back inside

Where the lava lies
Watch it rise
Keep my eyes
Hypnotize 

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep
