
I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling so brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm sure of falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt devil, almost fall apart then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is seizing us

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave no
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no
