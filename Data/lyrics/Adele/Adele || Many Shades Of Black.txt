Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say it's been that way
No, in fact it's been wasted on you

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out, let it all out and say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream, and shout and say things that are, so unkind
Yeah
See if I care
See if I stand firm or if i fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue is the answer to you

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black

Ohhhhh

Yeah everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
Oh, you cannot take it back
Cause there's many shades of black
You have many shades of black
You have many, you have many shades of black
Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Ohhhh ohhhh
