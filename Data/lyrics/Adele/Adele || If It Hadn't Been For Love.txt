If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
Put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
Put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
