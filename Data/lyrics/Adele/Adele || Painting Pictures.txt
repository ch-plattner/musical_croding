
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me 
So scratch my itch and beat my drum 
So i can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories
