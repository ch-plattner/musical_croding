In the beginning there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And you came in, turned the lights on
And created what is come to be

Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Déployer les ailés

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Plumerai les ailés

Though I'm walking through the shadows
You were with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now, time for sleeping
But before that, would you raise on me?

Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

By a thread we're hanging on
And I hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me
Know I wanna go with you

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Déployer les ailés

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Plumerai les ailés

Alouette, déployer les ailés
Alouette, déployer les ailés
