
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made, yeah
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

'Cause hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
