
My heart was blowing in the hurricanes,
My heart was blowing in your love, in your love
My heart was flying in tornadoes,
My heart was flying in your love, in your love

You see, I tried. Baby, oh, did I try?
The more I get closer to you
The more I know you just won't do
You see, I tried, girl, you know I tried (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, you're a natural disaster

Oh whoa oh

My mind was frozen in the blizzards,
My mind was frozen in your love, in your love
My mind was burnin' in the (wild fire),
My mind was burnin' in your love, in your love

You see, I tried. Baby, you know I tried
But, girl, I hate myself when you're near
Honey, get up and get out of here
You see, I tried. Darling, did I try? (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, you're a natural disaster

My body was shaking in your earthquakes,
You had my body quaking (in your love) from your love (oh, in your love)
My life was drowning in tsunamis,
You pulled me under baby (in your love) with your love, (oh, in your love) with your love

I'm telling you I tried. Did I ever try?
But in the end I'm broken and hurt
Now I know it'd never work
You see, I tried. Honey, oh, did I try? (oh I tried)

My soul–it died in Armageddon,
My soul–it died from your love, from your love
You're bringin' these plagues on me,
You brought me to my knees from your love, from your love

You see, I tried. Lord, did I try?
But, girl, you're rainin' hell on my earth,
I pray to heaven if I'm real worth
You see, I tried. Baby, did I try? (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, you're a natural disaster,
You're a natural disaster, you're a natural disaster
You're a natural disaster...
