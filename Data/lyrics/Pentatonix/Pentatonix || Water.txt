It's 10 past 2, still up thinking of you
If I showed you all I really want to
Would you stay, dare to push me away
I just can't return anymore

Timid heart, hide my scars
Make me stronger

I can't take this any longer
I need, I need you like water
It's on the tip of my tongue
I'm not asking for much
Just your love and not another
Cause your embrace keeps me warmer
Could I tell you this time
How I wish you were mine

My voice cracks, I wait for it to pass
Heart beats fast for words I can't take back
And so I pray I don't drive you away
Cause I'm scared of what I have to tell you

Timid heart, hide my scars
Make me stronger

I can't take this any longer
I need, I need you like water
It's on the tip of my tongue
I'm not asking for much
Just your love and not another
Cause your embrace keeps me warmer
Could I tell you this time
How I wish you were mine

I'll take you higher, take you high
I can make you come alive
Open your eyes, change your mind
I'll take you higher, take you high

I can't take this any longer
I need, I need you like water
It's on the tip of my tongue
I'm not asking for much
Just your love and not another
Cause your embrace keeps me warmer
Could I tell you this time
How I wish you were mine
How I wish you were mine
How I wish you were mine
