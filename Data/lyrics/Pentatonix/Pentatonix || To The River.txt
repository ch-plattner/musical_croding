
Don't say you're sorry
You never had to be alone
I'm in on your actions
There's no hope for you to atone

You'll never know this pain inside
No lie
This heart will only heal in time
The clock is tickin' the fear away so

Take me to the river and run
I'm divin' in
You'll see where it begins
Your lost when I fall in
So leave me to the brim
Where my breaking point is thin
You're trying to pull me in
Like fire in the wind
But I
I'm deep in shallow waters
I feel it pouring over, over

Get lost in the karma
This fever's rushin' hot and cold
You're ripe for the harvest
You'll only reap just what you sow

You'll never know this pain inside
No lie
This heart will only heal in time
The clock is tickin' the fear away so

Take me to the river and run
I'm diving in
You'll see where it begins
Your lost when I fall in
So leave me to the brim
Where my breaking point is thin
You're trying to pull me in
Like fire in the wind
But I
I'm deep in shallow waters
I feel it pouring over, over

Wade in the water
Wade in the water
Wade in the water
For your sons and daughters
Oh I said wade in the water, yeah
Clock is ticking, I'm not afraid

Take me to the river and run
I'm divin' in
You'll see where it begins
Your loss when I fall in
So leave me to the brim
Where my breaking point is thin
You're trying to pull me in
Like fire in the wind
But I
I'm deep in shallow waters
I feel it pouring over, over

But I
I'm deep in shallow waters
I feel it pouring over
