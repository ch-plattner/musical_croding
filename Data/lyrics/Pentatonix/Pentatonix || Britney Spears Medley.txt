[Kirstie:]
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I think I did it again
I made you believe
We're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean
That I'm serious

Just lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
(Dum dum dum dara)

Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh baby baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Scott:]
Baby can't you see
I'm callin'
A girl like you
Should wear a worn men
It's dangerous
I'm fallin'

Too high, can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinning 'round and 'round (Hey!)
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride (Hey!)
You're toxic
I'm slipping u-under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Ah..ah..ah..ah..ah
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Ah..ah..ah..ah..ah
Don't you know that you're  toxic?

[Mitch:]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the cloud somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Me me me me
It's Pentatonix

[Mitch, Kirstie, Scott:]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
No-no-now
Now
Drop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Ah...
Nananananananana

Oops! I did it again
Tell you oh,
Get lost!
Eighties game oh baby
(Yeah!)

With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
I'm addicted to you
Would you hold it against me?
