(Hey!)

Ooo, huh huh, yeah yeah
Come on girl

When I had you to myself, 
I didn't want you around
That pretty face has always 
made you stand out in a crowd
(I want you back)
Oh baby give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(Ah ah ah ah ah)

I want you back, oh now

A, B, C, it's as easy as 1, 2, 3, 
It's as simple as Do, Re, Mi.
A, B, C. 1, 2, 3, baby you and me girl

You and I must make a pact, 
We must bring, salvation back.
Where there is love, I'll be there
(You've got a friend in me)

Dancin' Dancin' Dancin'

And shout, (Shout) 
Shake your body down to the ground

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til ya

I wanna rock with you (I'll rock with ya), all night
Dance you (I'll dance with ya) into the sunlight 

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my

They told him don't you ever come around here.
Don't wanna see your face you better disappear.
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So Beat it, Beat it

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
Got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
Got to be startin' somethin'

Lookin' out yeah, across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
If they say Why, Why?
Tell 'em that it's Human Nature
Why, Why

'Cause this is Thriller, Thriller night
So let me hold you tight and make a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

I just can't stop lovin' you

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender Lovin' Care
And I'll take you there

You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come, on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)

The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now (You lift me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are)

I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways (No no no no no)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then 

Dirty Diana, Woah
Dirty Diana, Woah

Annie, are you ok?
Annie, are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A Smooth Criminal

I took my baby
To a Saturday bang (Saturday bang)
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles, and a miracle
Has happened tonight

'Cos if you're thinkin' 'bout my baby
It don't matter if you're Black Or White
(Na na na na na na)

Remember the Time

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place, could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
(You are not alone)
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a 
Better place

(Yeah) Hold me, like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend (You are my ooh)
Carry me, like you are my brother 
(You are my brother)
Love me like a mother
(Like my mother)
Will You Be There?

There are, ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and
For me
