
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
The beautiful sight, we're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married? We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kid is knockin' him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry be happy now

Don't worry
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Don't worry, 'cause we're walking in a winter wonderland
