Way Up High
There's a Land that I heard
Once In A lulla...

... Shatter every window til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Blown Away
(Falling from cloud 9)
Shatter every window til it's all blown away
(Letting go tonight)
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli
Lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli
Lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli
Lollipop
Lollipop

Shoes, shoes
Don't want no short, short men
Let's get some shoes, shoes
Don't want no short, short men
I got my ticket for the long way round
Two bottles of whiskey for the way
And I Sure Would Like Some Sweet Company
And I'm leaving tomorrow
What do you say
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess It made
It usually doesn't rain in
Southern California
Much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears
But boy they Bawl
When I'm thinking about you
You know, know, know
I've been thinking about you
You know, know, know
I've been thinking about you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, Do ya do do do
Do do you got a first aid kit, handy
Do do you know how to patch up a wound
Tell me, a-a-a-are you are you patient, understanding
Cause I might need some time to clear
The hole in my heart and I
I tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me
Damaged, damaged
I thought That I should let you know
That My Heart is Damaged
So damaged

And you can blame the one before
I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I cannot be
I knew you were trouble
When you walked in
So shame on you now
Took me to places I've never been
You're just a lion on the cold hard ground

(Oh hey oh hey oh hey he-e-e-ey he-e-e-e-y) [x3]
I'm living in the emerald city please
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters
Got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero needs his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock ticking
I just count the hours
Stop tripping
I'm tripping off the power

21st century schizoid man

Don't want no money
I like your beard
Just want those shoes
Ain't no wizard that can save you
From the witch of the west side
I'll get you and your little dog too
Cause there ain't no place you can hide
Show me your feet
Show them to me
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
"I'm going home
To the place where I belong"
Home sweet home
"Where your love has always been
Enough for me"
It will all be clear
Don't pay no mind to demons
They fill you with fear
And just know you're not alone
I'm gonna make this place our
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna go home
And now I'm on my way
I'm On My Way
Home sweet home
Tonight
Tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

Somewhere over the Rainbow
