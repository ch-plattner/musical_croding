
Do you really love me?
Do you really care?
Do you really want me?
Do you really.. at least pretend to love me girl
I don't care if that love is real

They say you're the baddest girl around
You take your men and then you shoot them down
They tell me to get out while I can 'cause she ain't good
For you man so I listened, and ran
But your body's got me thinking twice
Your reputation do not matter with those eyes
Don't care if you lying from the start
J-just take my heart and break it

[Bridge 1:]
Cause I am ready for you, take me on a ride
Baby, you never know if something's good until you try (oh, no)

[Chorus:]
Do you really love me? (Tell me that you love me, say it)
Do you really care? (I won't hold you to it, put me through it)
Do you really want me? (Don't worry, my heart is made of steel)
Do you really.. at least pretend to love me girl
I don't care if that love is real

Woah, woah, don't care if the love is real
Don't care if the love, love, don't care if the l-l-l-love

They say you're the baddest girl around
A heart that's breakin' is your favorite sound
Don't even know what you gon' put me through
You're having deja vu, just another man down so

[Bridge 2:]
I am ready for you, take me on a ride
Baby, you never know if something's good until you try

[Chorus]

You are the girl of my dreams
I know this love ain't real, but make believe is good enough for me
And if you give me a chance, somehow I'll change your mind
Though I know you know I know I'm wasting my time

Do you really love me? [X4]
(Do you love me? Put me through it, put me through it
Tell me do you love me? Please? Please?)
Love me, love me

[CHORUS]
