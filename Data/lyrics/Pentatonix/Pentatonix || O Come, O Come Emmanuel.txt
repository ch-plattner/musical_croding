
Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel
Oh, come, our Wisdom from on high
Who ordered all things mightily
To us the path of knowledge show
and teach us in her ways to go
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel
Oh, come, oh, come, our Lord of might,
Who to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times gave holy law
In majesty and cloud and awe
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel
