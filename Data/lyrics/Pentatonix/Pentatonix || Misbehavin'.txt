
A million miles away and I'm still thinking 'bout my baby
Ain't misbehavin', no, you don't need to worry
I'm having a good time, oh oh
And I've had one too many
But you're the only one on my mind

3 am, my phone is dead, I'm acting like a dang fool
We're singing We Found Love
And jumping in a swimming pools
Yeah, I had a good time, oh oh
And I've had one too many
But you're the only one on my mind

Oh but I know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh but I never lie
'Cause I'm yours, you're mine
But I ain't misbehavin', no
I ain't misbehavin' tonight

Everyone around me is just kissin' on somebody
But I'm just dancing by myself around the lobby
I'm having a good time, oh oh
And I've had two too many
But I'm just doing this to pass the time

Oh but I know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh, but I never lie
'Cause I'm yours, you're mine
But I ain't misbehavin', no
I ain't misbehavin' tonight

But I wonder, are you out there thinking of me?
Is it stupid that I'm asking "Do you miss me?"
Are you behavin'? Cause I'm savin' all my love for you
And I'm having a good time, but I'd rather be with you
A million miles away but I'm still thinking 'bout my baby
Ain't misbehavin', no, you don't need to worry

Oh but I know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh, but I never lie
'Cause I'm yours, you're mine
And I ain't misbehavin', no
I ain't misbehavin'
Told ya I ain't misbehavin', no
I ain't misbehavin'
I've had way too many
And you're the only one on my mind
