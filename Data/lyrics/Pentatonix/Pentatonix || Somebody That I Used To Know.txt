Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believin' it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
