
I want you!
I got one less, one less prob-prob-prob
I want you!
I got one less, one less (listen to me), oh!

Hey, baby, even though I hate ya!
I wanna love ya
I want you!
And even though I can't forgive you
I really want ya
I want you!

Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you!

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya!
Oh!
One less problem without ya!
One less!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you!
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you!
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you!

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya!
Oh!
One less problem without ya!
One less!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less (Tell 'em, Mitch)

Smart money bettin'
I'll be better off without you
In no time
I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Mitchy, Mitchy
To biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go
Let you back
I finally learned my lesson!
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems
But you won't be one
Like what!

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya!
Oh oh!
One less problem without ya!
One less oh!
One less problem without ya!
One less, one less problem

One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you

I got one less, one less, ooh!
