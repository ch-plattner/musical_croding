Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

He's making a list,
Checking it twice;
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa is coming to town

He's making a list,
Checking it twice;
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
