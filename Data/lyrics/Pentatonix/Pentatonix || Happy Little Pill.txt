
In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock afloat
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
Iâ€™ll take a dip into the unknown, unknown

Blazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping live from bottles, bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Ooh, Ooh...

My happy little pill
(Blazed eyes, empty hearts)
Take me away
(Buying happy from shopping carts)
Dry my eyes
(Nothing but time to kill)
Bring colour to my skies
(Sipping life from bottles)

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Ooh, Ooh...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes...
