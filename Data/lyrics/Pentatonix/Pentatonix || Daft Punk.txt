Like the legend of the phoenix (Yeah)
All ends with beginnings (Ohhh)
What keeps the planets spinning (Ahhh)
The force from the beginning (Oooooo)

We've come too far,
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

Say
We're up all night till the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're all up night till the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night – all night to get – up all night to get, get, get lucky

Last night I had this dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
There's nothing wrong with just a little bit of fun
We were dancing all night long

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I hope this dream comes true

One more time (Hey)
We're gonna celebrate
Oh yeah, all right
Don't stop the dancing
One more time
We're gonna celebra-a-a-a-a-ate

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after
Our work is never over

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after
Our work is never over

I'm a work it harder, make it bett-
Do it faster, makes us
More than ever hou-hour after
Ou-our work is never over

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever hour after
Our work is never over

Television rules the nation, oh yeah
Television rules the nation

Music's got me feeling so free
