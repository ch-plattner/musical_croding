
Uh-huh
Yeah!
Tell me am I going crazy? (Uh-huh)
Tell me have I lost my mind? (Yeah!)
Am I just afraid of lovin'? (Uh-huh)
Or am I not the lovin' kind? (Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight
Movies on a late night
Gettin' old
(Uh-huh)

I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot
But it's just cold
(Yeah!)

Somebody wake up my heart
Light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah (Uh-huh)
Cause' I can't do it anymore (Yeah!)

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love
(Yeah!)

Maybe I'm too picky, honey (Uh-huh)
But I'm not in the world you're in (Ah, ah)
I'm not in it for the money, ooooh
I'm here looking for the real thing
(Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight
Movies on a late night
Gettin' old, yeah
(It's gettin' old!)

I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot
But it's just cold
(So, so, so cold!)

Somebody wake up my heart
Light me up
Set fire to my soul (To my soul, to my soul, to my soul.)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, noo

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love
(Yeah!)

Oh, I'm tired of dreaming of no one (I'm tired)
I need some body next to mine (I'm, I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone (give it to someone...)
Because I can't do it anymore!

Oh! Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day (about all day)
The kind that keeps me up all night (keeps me up all night)
Gimme that can't sleep love
(Yeah!)
