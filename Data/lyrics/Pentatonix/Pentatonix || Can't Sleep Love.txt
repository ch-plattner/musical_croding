
Uh... huh
Yeah!
Tell me am I going crazy? (Uh... huh)
Tell me have I lost my mind? (Yeah!)
Am I just afraid of lovin'? (Uh... huh)
Or am I not the lovin' kind? (Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight,
Movies on a late night,
Gettin' old.
(Uh... huh)

I've been there, done that.
Supposed to be hot,
But it's just cold.
(Yeah!)

Somebody wake up my heart,
Light me up,
Set fire to my soul, yeah. (Uh... huh)
Cause' I can't do it anymore. (Yeah!)

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day,
The kind that keeps me up all night.
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)

Maybe I'm too picky, honey. (Uh... huh)
But I'm not in the world you're in. (hah, hah, hah)
I'm not in it for the money, ooooh
I'm your looking for the real thing.
(Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight,
Movies on a late night,
Gettin' old.
(It's gettin' old!)

I've been there, done that.
Supposed to be hot,
But it's just cold.
(So, so, so cold!)

Somebody wake up my heart,
Light me up,
Set fire to my soul. (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul.)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, noooo...

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day,
The kind that keeps me up all night.
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)

Oh, I'm tired of dreaming I'm no one. (I'm tired.)
I need some body next to mine. (I-I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone, (give it to someone...)
Because I can't do it anymore!

[Tink:]
Rejected, heart is like a veto
We can't last if your love is incognito
A bit of time, that's all that I ask
You know you leave me out to long and I'll go back
Verbatim, I'm hot as a volcano
You want a taste you better be bringing more to the table
Speaking of, I want your love sweeter, sweet and low
Come set me on fire
You gotta be the man of my desire
Yes I'm yearning butterflies returning
To get the usual
Get deep as a swimming pool
Yea yea
Bottled up with all of these emotions
You know I got to pour this out to someone
My sweet love

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day, (about all day)
The kind that keeps me up all night. (keeps me up all night)
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)
