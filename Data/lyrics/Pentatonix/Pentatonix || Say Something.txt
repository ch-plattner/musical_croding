[Kirstie:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere, I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

[Kirstie and Scott:]
And I...
Am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

[Kirstie and Mitch:]
And I...
Will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

[Mitch, Scott and Kirste:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Mmmm...
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Oh, no...
Anywhere I would have followed you
Ohhh...
Say something, I'm giving up on you

[Avi:]
And I...
Will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Whoa oh oh...

[Kirstie:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you

[Mitch:]
Say something...

[Avi:]
Say something...

[Kirstie:]
Say something...
I'll be the one if you want me to

[Avi:]
Whoa oh oh...

[Mitch:]
Say something

[Scott:]
Say something

Say something, I'm giving up on you

[Scott and Avi:]
I'll be the one if you want me to

[Scott, Avi and Mitch:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you

[Scott, Avi, Mitch and Kirstie:]
I'll be the one if you want me to

[Kirstie (Scott, Avi and Mitch underneath):]
Say, say something, I'm giving up on you 
(say something, I'm giving...)

Oh whoa...
(...up on you, whoa I'll...)

I'll be the one if you want me to
(...be the one if you...)

Oh whoa...
(...want me to, oh, say something, I'm giving up on you)

Say something, I'm giving up
(whoa oh oh...)

(I'll be the one if you want me to)

If you want me to, oh, if you want me to
(whoa oh oh)

[Scott, Avi, Mitch and Kirstie:]
Anywhere, I would have followed you
Whoa...

[Kirstie (Scott, Avi and Mitch underneath):]
Say something
(say something)

Say something
(say something)

Say something
(say something)

[Scott, Avi, Mitch and Kirstie:]
Ahh, ooh...

[Kevin:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Oh whoa...
