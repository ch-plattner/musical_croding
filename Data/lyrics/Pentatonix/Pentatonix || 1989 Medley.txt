
Yeah
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Whoa

Nice to, meet you, where you, been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my god, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space babe
(And I'll write your name) 

You got that James Dean
Day dream, look in your eyes
And I got that red lip, classic, thing that you like
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style 

Are we out of the woods yet? 
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet (good)
Are we out of the woods yet? 
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?

Stay, hey
All you had to do was stay, hey
Had me in the palm of your hand, well
It could've been easy, oh
All you had to do was

I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
Thats what people say, mhm
Thats what people say, mhm. Hey!
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, shake it off

I wish you would come back, wish I never, hung up the phone like I did I,
Wish you knew that, I'll never forget you as long as I live and I,
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good,
I wish you would, woah

Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know we used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby now we've got bad blood

Say you'll remember me, standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (I want you for worst or for better)

This love is good,
This love is bad,
This love is alive back from the dead

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I 
You stand with your hand on my waist-line
Good to see that we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
(Take me home) 
I got a blank space babe,
(I've been waiting for you) 
Are you out of the woods yet? Are you out of the woods yet?
(Day-dream look in your eyes)
Welcome to New York
I've been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
