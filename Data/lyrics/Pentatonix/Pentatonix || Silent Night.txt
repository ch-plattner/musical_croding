Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace

Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace

Sleep Sleep...

Silent Night, Holy Night (Sleep Sleep)
Silent Night, Holy Night (Sleep Sleep)
Silent Night, Holy Night
Silent Night, Holy Night
