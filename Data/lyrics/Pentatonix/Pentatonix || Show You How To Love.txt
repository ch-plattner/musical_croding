
This girl's got me falling in love
And out of my mind
My heart is racing, I'm out of breath
And I'm wasting my time
She's looking at me like she's never seen me running round her head, oh yeah
So will you dance with me,
Or do I have to show you how to love instead?
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
Gimme one chance and I promise that I'll show you the way, oooh
I'll take you far from here and show you how the night turns to day
I can love you better than that other guy who broke your heart
Tell me, tell me, do you love me baby?
This party's about to start, start, start, start
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
This party's about to start
Start, start, start
This party's about to start
