It doesn't matter if your days are long (Sing!)
It doesn't matter if your night's gone wrong (Sing!)
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet and sing it (Whoa, sing!)
It doesn't matter if he let you go (Sing!)
It doesn't matter if she hurt you so (Sing!)
Get up and dance, just feel that beat and sing it (Whoa, sing!)

I don't know what you've been told
But music make you lose control

Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it out as hard as you can
Make 'em hear ya from LA to Japan
Don't let 'em bring you down
This is how we do it now
Go and roll them windows down and
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it with your hands in the sky
Light it up like it's the 4th of July
Don't let 'em bring you down
You know what I'm talking 'bout
A little bit louder now

It doesn't matter if you're way off track (Sing!)
Feel like you're headed for a heart attack (Sing!)
Just raise your voice and bring the noise and sing it (Whoa, sing!)
Sing for your mama, sing for your daughter (Sing!)
Sing for you sisters, misters, best friends, brother (Sing!)

Cause I don't know what you've been told
But music make you lose control (Sing!)

Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it out as hard as you can
Make 'em hear ya from LA to Japan
Don't let 'em bring you down
This is how we do it now
Go and roll them windows down and
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it with your hands in the sky
Light it up like it's the 4th of July
Don't let 'em bring you down
You know what I'm talking 'bout
A little bit louder now

Sing it for your mama, ay
Sing it for your papa, ay
Sing it for the whole world
For your boy or girl, for your #1 bae
KO on the beat, okay?
I'm the human 808
Go ahead, go sing it, don't talk
Cause the beat won't stop
No way, way, way, way

Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it out as hard as you can
Make 'em hear ya from LA to Japan
Don't let 'em bring you down
This is how we do it now
Go and roll them windows down and
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing it with your hands in the sky
Light it up like it's the 4th of July
Don't let 'em bring you down
You know what I'm talking 'bout
A little bit louder now
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Sing a little bit louder now

Ooh [4x]

Let me hear you sing
