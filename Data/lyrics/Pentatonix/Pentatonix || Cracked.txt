
I broke something I'll never get, I'll never get back
Brought me to my knees
A head like steel and a soul of gold
And a heart that's made of glass

But mine's cracked, whoa!
Well, mine's cracked! Whoa!
Well, mine's cracked
No idea where I'm going
(No idea where I'm going)
But there's no looking back
'Cause I'm cracked! Whoa!

You stole something I'll never get, I'll never get back
You left a hole in me, oh lord!
Your halo's gone and all I see is horns
And a heart that's still intact

But mine's cracked, whoa!
Well, mine's cracked! Whoa!
Well, mine's cracked
No idea where I'm going
(No idea where I'm going)
But there's no looking back
'Cause I'm cracked! Whoa!

Fire, fire rising inside me
Liar, liar, treat me so bad
My, oh my, you hurt me so gladly
Why, oh why you do me like that
Fire, fire rising inside me
Liar, liar, treat me so bad
My, oh my, you hurt me so gladly
Why, oh why you do me like that
Fire, fire rising inside me
Liar, liar, treat me so bad
My, oh my, you hurt me so gladly
Why, oh why you do me like that!
Whoa-oh-oh!

OOOooouuwo-oh-uh

Mine's cracked! Whoa!
Well, mine's cracked! Whoa!
'Cause I'm cracked!
No idea where I'm going
(No idea where I'm going)
But there's no looking back
I'm cracked, whoa!
'Cause I'm cracked! Whoa!
I'm cracked, whoa!
Eh! No idea where I'm going!
(No idea where I'm going)
And there's no looking back
I'm cracked, whoa!
Sing it with me now! Whoa!
