Oh, friend of mine
Will you be mine?
Please don't be so...
It's OK to be terrified (terrified)
Please don't be so shy

So will you never be my lover or my Valentine
Never be a friend of mine
Never see my better side
Baby, you'd be terrified
Of all the secrets you were wishing you won't ever find
'Cause deep inside me
And I don't wanna hide me

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love

Yeah, pick it fast like a flight far away from here (fly away)
Although I know I feel at home whenever you are near
Live my life, like you better cold cut to this
I wish you'd hold me open just to see your vision clear

'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
About my love
About my love
About my love

Oh, friend of mine
Will you be mine?
Please don't be so...
It's OK to be terrified (terrified)
Please don't be so shy
