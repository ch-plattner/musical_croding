
All of my life been running,
Paying the price for nothing
How do the young survive?
We're never satisfied,
Only if I could listen.

When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I run to?
When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I hide?
When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I run to?
When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I hide?

(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

(ohohohohoh)
In the middle of the night,
I'll be running, running, running
(ohohohohoh)
And I'm on my way (I'm on my way) home.
(I'm on my way)

All that imprides of ruin,
It's in our design so human.
How do the young survive?
(How do the young survive?)
We're never satisfied,
(we're never satisfied)
I really wish I could listen.

When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I run to?
When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I hide?

(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

(ohohohohoh)
In the middle of the night,
I'll be running, running, running
(ohohohohoh)
And I'm on my way
(I'm on my way)
Home.
(I'm on my way)

Lights go down,
Where will I run to?
Lights go down,
Where will I hide?

Lights go down,
(All my life, I've been running, running, running, oh)
Where will I run to.
Lights go down,
(All my life, I've been running, running, running, oh)
(On my way)
Where will I hide.

When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I run to?
When the lights go down in the middle of the night, where will I hide?

(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(ohohohohoh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

(ohohohohoh)
In the middle of the night,
I'll be running, running, running
(ohohohohoh)
And I'm on my way (I'm on my way) home.
(I'm on my way)

All my life, I've been running,
Running and I'm on my way.
All my life, I've been running.
