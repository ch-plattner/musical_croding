Novocaine to make me numb
Don't you worry 'cause the night is young
Dance until the morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning, morning, morning-ning-ning-ning-ning-ning

I am at a loss for words
Can't believe I let you pull me down to this place
You stole my heart and soul
Just to think that I had dried those tears from your face
I've played such a foolish game
Feeling you were everything to me and more
I don't mean to point the blame
But baby you have hurt me to my very core

You don't know why
You don't know how
You don't know when to love again
You let me in then shut me out
You have to learn to love again

Learn to love again [3x]
Ah

Take me away from here
To a place where my feelings don't go to waste
We were in the atmosphere
Flying high above the stars that shone on his face

So I'm running running baby from this hurting that you've given me
All through the night
Are we dancin' baby dancin' so your pretty face is hard to see
Tonight, tonight, tonight (dancin' through the night)

You don't know why
You don't know how
You don't know when to love again
You let me in then shut me out
You have to learn to love again (work!)

Imma teach you how to love
Imma teach you
Imma teach you how to love
Imma teach... (work!)

Learn to love again (Imma teach you how to love)
Learn to love again (Imma teach you)
Learn to love again, love again, love again (Imma teach you to love)

Taste the pain right on my tongue
Novocaine to make me numb
Don't you worry 'cause the night is young
Dance until the morning sun

Taste the pain right on my tongue (you don't know why, you don't know how)
Novocaine to make me numb (you don't know when to love again)
Don't you worry 'cause the night is young (you let me in then shut me out)
Dance until the morning sun (you have to learn to love again)
Morning sun (love again)
Morning sun (love again)
Morning, morning sun (love again, love again)

Imma teach you how to love

You don't know why
You don't know how
You don't know when to love again
You let me in then shut me out
You have to learn to love again
