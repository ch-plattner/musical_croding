You get the best of both worlds
Chilling out take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know you got the best of both

Everybody makes mistakes
HEY
Everybody has those days
Sometimes I'm in a jam
I gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it

Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
Again and again till I get it right
Nobody's perfect

I've got my sight set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will, never be tamed
I knew you were something special, when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

The seven things I hate about you
Your vain
Your games 
You're insecure 
You love me you like her 
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which, side to buy

Boom clap 
Boom de clap de clap
Boom clap 
Boom de clap de clap 
Zigzag across the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One foot in 
180 twist 
Do the Hoedown Throwdown

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming
But there's a voice inside my head saying you'll never reach it
There's always gonna be another mountain always gonna wanna make it move
Ain't about what's awaiting on the other side it's the climb

Bada ba ba bada bada ba
I hopped of the plane at L.A.X. 
With my dream and my cardigan
Welcome to land of fame excess whoa am I gonna fit in
My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turn on the radio 
And a Beyonce song was on 
And a Beyonce song was on
And a Beyonce song was on
So I put my hands up they're playing my song and the butterflies fly away
E-yeah e-yeah e-yeah e-yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A. 

I go through guys like money flying of a hand
They try to change me but they realize they can't
Every tomorrow is a day I never planned
If you're gonna be my man understand
I can't be tamed
I can't be saved
I can't be played
I can't be 
I can't!1 I can't!! 

Sup everybody we can do what we want
It's all fine we can say what we want 
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss if we want
We can sing what we want
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cos we came to have much fun now
And somebody here's gonna have so much fun now
So ladadadi
We like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house 
This is our rules
We can't stop
We wont stop can't you see it's we who own the night
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life
E-yeah yeah

We clawed 
We chained 
Our heart in vain, we jumped never asking why
We kissed I fell under your spell, a love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away, I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was
Wreck me

Boy I adore you
Boy I adore you

It's the climb 
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it (chilling out take it slow, then you rock out the show)
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain you're games you're insecure (e-yeah e-yeah e-yeah)
My best friend Mitchie says it's just him and Scotty
We can't stop 
You wrecked me
(ohhh) and we wont stop
You wrecked me
We can't stop
We wont stop
E-yeah e-yeah
