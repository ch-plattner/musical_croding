I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one, not one, not one, not two, not two, not three, not three problems!
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

Were going up! On a Tuesday! Got your girl in the club and she choosy.
Hey! Were going up! On a Tuesday! 

I'm in love with the coco! I'm in love with the coco!
I'm in love (I'm in love) I'm in love (I'm in love) I'm in love with cocaine! 

Blame it on the goose. Got you feeling loose. Blame it on patron.
Got you on the zone. Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol. Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol. 

Bitch better have my money! (you don't know me well enough)
Bitch better have my money (please don't call me on my bluff)
Pay me what you owe me. Give me all your money. 

I never f*cked Wayne. I never f*cked Drake.
All my life, man (f*ck sake) if I did I'd Minaj with'em AMD let'em eat my ass like a cupcake!
Look at me now, look at me now, look at me now, I'm getting paper! 

I'm getting high with my baby (just left the mall) I'm getting fly with my baby (I'm in the kitchen) cooking pies with my baby. 

Pills and potions, we're overdosing, can't stand it but I still love you.
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove. 

I don't f*ck with you! I don't f*ck with you! You little stupid ass bitch (no,no,no) I ain't f*ckin' with you! 

Cause your a good girl and you know it. Yeah, you act so different around me.
Oh, 'cause your a good girl and you know it, you know it (I know, I know) I know exactly who you could be. 

This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles,
D*ck bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel.
Real country ass dude, let me play with his rifle. 

Oh, my anaconda don't, my anaconda don't (want) want none!
