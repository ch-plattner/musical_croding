
I counted the stars tonight,
Oh how they shine so bright,
I gather them all, so we perfectly align
While we gaze from far away.
And separately watch the day
Come rising across the horizon in our minds.

But now I know,
My heart is strong,
Where you belong
Is by my side.
So will you hold,
'cause time is cold,
But in your soul
I'm standing by.

Ohohohohohoh ohohohohohoh

I have waited a thousand years,
And now that tomorrow's here,
I will shout from the mountain top
Our hearts belong near.
And we've traveled land and sea,
Our beacon the love we keep,
But when we unite,
This will all have been our dream.

And now we know,
Our hearts are strong,
Where we belong
Is side by side.
And so we'll hold
Each other close,
And in our souls
We're standing by.

Ohohohohohoh ohohohohohoh
Ohohohohoh ohohohohoh
Ohohohohohoh ohohohohoh
Ohohoh ohohohohohohoh ohohohohohohoh ohohoh

And so we'll hold
Each other close
And then we'll know
We're standing by.
