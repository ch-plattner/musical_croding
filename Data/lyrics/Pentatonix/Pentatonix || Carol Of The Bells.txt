Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling. (Oh! Oh! Ahh)

One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere (From everywhere)
Filling the air

Oh how they pound, (Oh how they pound)
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale. (Telling their tale)

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas, (Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas. (Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)

On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong

La, da, da, da, da,
La, da, da, da, da,
La, da, da, da, da...

Hark how the bells, (Hark how the bells)
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say, (All seem to say)
Throw cares away (We will throw cares away)

Christmas is here (Christmas is here)
Bringing good cheer (Bringing cheer)
To young and old (To the young and old)
Meek and the bold

Oh how they pound, (Oh how they pound)
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale (Telling their tale)

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
(Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
(Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)

On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home

Ah! Ah! Ah!

La, da, da, da, da,
La, da, da, da, da,
