
Just for now...

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know?
Is what I always wanted
Can never have had too many of these
Quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying
Somebody make her shut up
About it
Can we settle down, please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Bite. Tongue. Deep. Breathes
Count to ten. Nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alone
Whoever put
On this music
You better quick
Sharp the move it
Pour me another
No don't wag your finger at me

That time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me outta here [x3]
Get me outta here [x3]
Won't you get me outta here
Get me outta here [x2]
Get me outta here [x3]
Just for now...
