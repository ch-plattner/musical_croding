
Started like a movie scene
Once upon a London street
Tried to play it like James Dean
Cigarettes in my sleeve

Like a myth, the story of our lives
Couldn't fit in only black and white
If it's true that legends never die
Me and you could stand the test of time

We could be timeless, we could be classic
We could be stars, we could be rose gold, rose gold
We could be diamonds, we could be an anthem
We could be stars, we could be rose gold, rose gold

Driving up the coast somewhere
Salt water in your hair
Too many people on this road
We could take the canyon home

Like a myth, the story of our lives
Couldn't fit in only black and white
If it's true that legends never die
Me and you could stand the test of time

We could be timeless, we could be classic
We could be stars, we could be rose gold, rose gold
We could be diamonds, we could be an anthem
We could be stars, we could be rose gold, rose gold

Like a myth, the story of our lives
Couldn't fit in only black and white
If it's true that legends never die
Me and you could stand the test of time

We could be timeless, we could be classic
We could be stars, we could be rose gold, rose gold
We could be diamonds
Yeah, we could be rose gold, rose gold
