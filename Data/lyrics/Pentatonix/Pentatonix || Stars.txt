If you believe in what you wanna see
One day your pain will be your blessing
In every fall's a lesson
Face the insecurity

Cause everyone feels it, knows it
Tries not to show it
Search for the lion inside yourself
The universe is here to own
Let your place in the world
Be a place you can go

We're all made of stars (made of stars)
We're all made of dreams (made of dreams)
Just use your spirit and heart
You can go where you want, do what you like
Be who you wanna be

We give it away with nothing left to lose
Got the strongest heart but still the skin can bruise
Only the climb will get you higher
Defeat will make a fighter
Stare into the face of the truth

Cause everyone hears it, fears it
Never goes near it
Search for the lion inside yourself
The universe is here to own
Let your place in the world
Be a place you can go

We're all made of stars (made of stars)
We're all made of dreams (made of dreams)
Just use your spirit and heart
You can go where you want, do what you like
Be who you wanna be

Courage can shelter your heart and mind
From the pain and the misery, that's where I wanna be
We're not stopping or wasting time
This is how it was meant to be, a life of discovery

I regret every single day I
Waited for the world to be mine
Look to the sky we're reaching
Higher than high
Mile after mile

We're all made of stars (made of stars)
We're all made of dreams (made of dreams)
Just use your spirit and heart
You can go where you want, do what you like
Be who you wanna be

We're all made of stars (made of stars)
We're all made of dreams (made of dreams)
Just use your spirit and heart
You can go where you want, do what you like
Be who you wanna be

Be what you wanna be (be what you wanna be)
Be what you wanna be
