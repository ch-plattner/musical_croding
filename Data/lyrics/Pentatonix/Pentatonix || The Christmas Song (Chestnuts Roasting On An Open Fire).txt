
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols
Being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep, tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And every mother's child
Is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly...
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, to you
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And every mother's child
Is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly...
So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two...
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, to you
Merry Christmas
