Now watch me whip, now watch me nae nae
(So fun!) Now break your legs
And break your legs

Fire up the loud, another round of shots
Turn down for what, for what, for what?
Turn down for what?

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

You used to call me on my cell phone (cell phone)
Late night when you need my love
You used to call me on my cell phone (call me on my cell phone)
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling, bling, bling, bling
That could only mean one thing

Mitch caught a body 'bout a week ago
Hmmmmmmmmm

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed

To the window, to the wall,
'til the sweat drops down my baaaa

I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
Tryna take away from me
(I've) I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
(Got enemies) Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
Tryna take away from me

Pour it up, pour it up
Watch it all fall out
And pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Turn up the lights in here, baby
(Fast cars, shooting stars, all of the lights)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
('til it's Vegas everywhere where we are, all of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love you when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah

If you feelin' like a pimp, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
People are crazy, don't forget that boy, told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder, brush it off
