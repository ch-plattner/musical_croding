My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah

She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but
I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Well she walks like a model
She grants my wishes
Like a genie in the bottle
Saying yeah, yeah
I'm a wizard of love and I got the magic wand
And all these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

Do you need me?
Tell me do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection [x7]

Right there, right there, when I need her
Right there, right there, when I need her [x5]

Do you need me?
Tell me, tell me tell me
Do you think I'm pretty?
Tell me, tell me tell me? [x3]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Da da, da da, da da, da da

Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Ooh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
