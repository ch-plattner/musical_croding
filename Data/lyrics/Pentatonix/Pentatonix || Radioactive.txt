I'm waking up to ash and dust,
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,
I'm breathing in, the chemicals.
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, woah.

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

I'm breaking in, shaping up, 
then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, woah.

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

All systems go, sun hasn't died.
Deep in my bones, straight from inside.

I'm waking up, I'm waking up, I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
