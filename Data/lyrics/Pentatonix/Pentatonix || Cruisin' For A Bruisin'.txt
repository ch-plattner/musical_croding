Here we go!
You better run, run, run 
'Cause here we come 
Revving our engines under the sun 
'Cause we're cruisin' for a bruisin' 
Keeping me cool! 
Smooth and steady! 
Slicked back hair 
Man, things are getting heavy! 
And we're cruisin' for bruisin' 
Two wheels and an open road 
Wrapped in leather 
And ready to go! 

So don't stop, stop the music! 
We ride fast like a bullet 
We do anything we want, anytime we want 
Oh yeah, oh yeah! 
We just ride, ride, ride all day! 
We're not gonna live any other way! 

Bubblegum cherry pop 
Go to the hop 
Hanging with my brother 
'Cause his friends are so hot 
While they're cruisin', for some bruisin'! 

Alright, 
I went to the drive in and what did I see? 
A hundred little betties all staring at me! 
I was cruising for some loving! 
I got these two wheels and an open road 
So just pop that clutch, I'm ready to go! 

So don't stop, stop the music! 
We ride fast like a bullet 
We do anything we want, anytime we want 
Oh yeah, oh yeah! 
[x2]

We just ride, ride, ride all day! 
We're not gonna live any other way
