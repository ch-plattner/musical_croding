But that's when you rise to the challenge, 'cause it's your time, your moment, and nothing can stop us now!

PTX, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit.
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweatergang nope nope y’all can’t copy
Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
Ha! and we do it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record
And yep yep yep yep I’m on
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T cause ha,
Chasing dreams since we were 14
With the four track
Bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack,
Fat cat, crushing

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us,
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
We put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. yeah I'm so dang grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Texas raised you
Y’all can’t stop me, go hard
Like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat
Like I gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week
Oh, raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility keep marching

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us,
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Pa ra rap pa pa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa paaa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa pa
(Pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa
(and so we put our hands up)

(Oooh whoa!)
Pa ra rap pa pa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa paaa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa pa
(Pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa
Let's go!

[3x]
Nana nana nana nana
Oh
(and so we put our hands up)

Nana nana nana nana
Ooh Whoa whoa!!!!

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us (like the ceiling can’t hold us)
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
We put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
