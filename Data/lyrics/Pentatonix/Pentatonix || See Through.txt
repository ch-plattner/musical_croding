World under my skin
There for you to find 
All I've kept within
Lay before your eyes

I can't afford to lose
Another second with you
I've been waiting a long time
Can't afford to lose
Another second with you
I am yours and you are mine

I am see through, baby
So take a look inside
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide
For the very first time, 
for the very first time
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide

Stripped down to my heart
Naked to the core
All of me uncharted
Begs to be explored

Can't afford to lose
Another second with you
I've been waiting a long time
I can't afford to lose
Another second with you
I am yours and you are mine

I am see through, baby
So take a look inside
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide
For the very first time, 
for the very first time
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide

Take a look inside
I'm not gonna hide
Who I am inside

I am see through, baby
So take a look inside
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide
For the very first time, 
for the very first time
I am see through, baby
And I don't wanna hide
