
Maybe I got just a little too much pride
To let you back into my life
You think I miss you
Not yet, not yet
Maybe you thought about what you put me through
A sorry is long overdue
You want it again
I bet, I, I, I bet

So cry, cry baby, I already let you go
Bye bye, baby, I don't mess with you no mo'
Nah, nah, baby, just because I'm movin on

Don't you 'member back in the day
When all you had to do was say yes
But you walked away
You made your bet, you know the rest
Now you want me to say yes
Did you right, but you went and left
You think this is a game
You ain't gon' win cause I'm the ref

Did it all, all because of your ego
You thought that you was irreplaceable, yeah
There's a couple things that you can't erase
You learn your place from your mistakes

So cry, cry baby, I already let you go
Bye bye, baby, I don't mess with you no mo'
Nah, nah, baby, just because I'm movin on

Don't you 'member back in the day
When all you had to do was say yes
But you walked away
You made your bet, you know the rest
Now you want me to say yes
I did you right, but you went and left
You think this is a game
You ain't gon' win cause I'm the ref

I bet you're thinking that I will take you back
Just like I did the last time, ain't havin' that
I won't be taking you back, matter of fact
You messed up the winning game
Ref, play it back

Don't you 'member back in the day
When all you had to do was say yes
But you walked away
You made your bet, you know the rest
Now you want me to say yes
Did you right, but you went and left
You think this is a game
You ain't gon' win cause I'm the ref

Play it back
Won't you play it back?
Ref, play it back
