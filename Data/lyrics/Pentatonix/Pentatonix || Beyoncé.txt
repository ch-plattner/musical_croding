Mama said, "You're a pretty girl.
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth.
What you wear is all that matters."

Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
It's the soul that needs the surgery

(Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?)

What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
You must be hauntin'

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, in love
In love
We be all night, in love
Love

- then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good

Can you eat my skittles
It's the sweetest in the middle

I'm a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin' babe 
Just tell me how it's lookin' babe 
(Drop!)

Oh, there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby be better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Forget what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless

I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us

I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
Blue

You love me like XO
(Blue)
You love me like XO
(Blue)
You love me like XO
As long as you know who you belong to

I remember being young and so brave
(Pretty hurts)
I knew what I needed
(We shine the light on whatever's worst)

We'd be alright
In love
Promise, I'm keeping mine

You love me like XO
(When you're lying in your bed)
You love me like XO
(Are you happy with yourself?)
Baby, put your arms around me
(Are you happy with yourself?)

Yeah

(Uh huh huh)

... Surfboard!
