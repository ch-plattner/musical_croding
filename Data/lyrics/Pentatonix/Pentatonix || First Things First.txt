
Telling me that you ain't fly
Unless you own a private jet
Telling me you ain't worth it now
If you ain't made a million yet
Fame, money and the finer things
Found your worth in the following
Addicted to that quantity
Want that international love

Don't you know that everything you've ever wanted doesn't have a price tag on it?
Earn it first, don't have to flaunt it
What you've got is something flawless

Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first
Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first

Hold up, slow down, take a breath
Running and you don't know why (why)
Once you learn how to build your own track
It'll take you to the finish line
Fame, money and the VIP (VIP)
That don't mean nothing to me (nothing on me)
Not saying you should work for free
Just don't forget how to love

Don't you know that everything you've ever wanted doesn't have a price tag on it?
Earn it first, don't have to flaunt it
What you've got is something flawless

Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first
Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first

First things first, you need love, humility
Take away all the animosity
First things first, you need love, humility
Take away all the animosity
First things first, you need
All you need is love, love and humility
Take away all the animosity
Wait a minute

Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first
Wait a minute, first things first
Take a second, first things first
