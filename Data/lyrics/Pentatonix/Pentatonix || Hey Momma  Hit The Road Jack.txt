My independent women, let me see you
All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you

Hey mamma, I don't want no drama
But the way you look be makin' me smile
Hey baby, I know you are a lady
But your moves, your dress
Girl I'm likin' your style

I know that you don't wanna be bothered
But baby, you (but you) make me wanna holler
You know that I am into you
Why you got to say

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more

All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you
All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you

Hey mamma, I know you got a problem
'Cause the men back then had been all wrong
Hey baby, I know I'm kinda crazy
But beside me's right where you belong

Just to let you know I'll make you feel better
Make you up, be the only one forever
Take me back a chance, let me be your man
Why you got to say

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more

(That's right, ah)
Don't you come back no more
(Boy, tell 'em, ah)
Don't you come back no more
(That's right, ah)
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more

Oh woman, oh woman, don't you treat me so mean
You're the meanest little woman that I ever did see
(I don't care, I don't care)
What you mean you don't care
(You know exactly what I mean)

Baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
I'll be back on my feet someday
(Yeah right, every man say)
Oh there ain't nothin' you can say

I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go

Hit the road, hit the, hit the road, Jack
Hit the road, Jack, never comin' a-back
Hit the road, hit the road

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more

(That's right, ah)
Don't you come back no more
(Boy, tell 'em, ah)
Don't you come back no more
(That's right, ah)
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more

All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you
All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you
