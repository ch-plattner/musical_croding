Tonight, the apple falls in Time
We'll sing along with Auld Lang Syne
And throw confetti high up into space
Tomorrow morning when we wake
This town will be a different place
And the past will wash away like coffee stains

We could be kings of the world
On top of the nation
It's a celebration of the moments to come
The city's on fire
We're holding up lighters
Raising them higher and we've only begun

Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
Let's kiss the past away
Like New Year's Day
Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
It's time to celebrate
Like New Year's Day

Another year will dim devine
We'll play it back in slow rewind
And laugh about the cold and bitter nights
We're route our way on maps of stars
Hold on tight to fragile hearts
And keep our friends forever by our side

We could be kings of the world
On top of the nation
It's a celebration of the moments to come
The city's on fire
We're holding up lighters
Raising them higher and we've only begun

Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
Let's kiss the past away
Like New Year's Day
Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
It's time to celebrate
Like New Year's Day

Morning breaks, take my hand
Wide awake with arms wide open
Catch your breath, walk this way
No regrets on New Year's Day
Morning breaks, take my hand
(Kings of the world, top of the nation)
Wide awake with arms wide open
(It's a celebration of the moments to come)
Catch your breath, walk this way
(City's on fire, holding up lighters)
No regrets on New Year's Day
(Raising them higher, we've only begun)

We could be kings of the world
On top of the nation
It's a celebration of the moments to come
The city's on fire
We're holding up lighters
Raising them higher and we've only begun

Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
Let's kiss the past away
Like New Year's Day
Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
It's time to celebrate
Like New Year's Day
