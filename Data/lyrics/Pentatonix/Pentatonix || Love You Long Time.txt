Nobody ever loved me
Quite like you do.
(Your love is like...)
Got a real girl and she loves me alot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I
I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'ma love you long time.
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
OH!
Let me, let me love you!
Let me, let me love you!
Let me, let me love you.
I
Never knew someone like you.
Oh no
Oh no
And I never felt the way I do
Before
Before
Before
I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left baby
I swear I would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting foolish
Nobody ever loved me quite like you
Got a real girl and she loves me alot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I
I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'ma love you long time.
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
This is the sweetest thing I know
For sure
For sure
And you
You give me reason
To
Hold on
I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left baby
I swear I would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting foolish
Nobody ever loved me quite like you
Got a real girl and she loves me alot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I
I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'ma love you long time.
I'ma love you a long time
I'ma love you a long time
I'ma love you a long time
Whoa
I'ma love you a long time
I'ma love you a long, long, long, time
Whoa
Let me
Let me love you!
Let me
Let me love you!
OH
Let me
Let me love you!
Baby
Got a real girl and she loves me alot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I
I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'ma love you long time.
