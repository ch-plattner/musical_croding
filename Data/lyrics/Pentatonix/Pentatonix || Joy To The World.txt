Joy to the world! Oh woah

Joy to the world! The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world!
Joy to the world! Oh

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

Joy to the world then we sing,
(Let the earth receive her King!)
Joy to the world then we sing,
(Let the angel voices ring)
Joy to the world then we sing,
(Let the men their songs employ)
Joy to the world then we sing,
(And repeat the sounding joy)

Ohh
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove (and makes the nations prove)
And glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

And wonders, wonders of His love

Joy to the world then we sing,
(Let the earth receive her King!)
Joy to the world then we sing,
(Let the angel voices ring)
