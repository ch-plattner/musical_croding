
You gotta let it go
'Cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you?
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now
Of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot

You never let me go
Got me chained to your touch
Like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true
Afraid to let you go
'Cause without you I'm lost
And no matter the cost
I'm standing next to you

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot

My back's against the wall tonight
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights out
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
I see the fear that's in your eyes
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
Go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
