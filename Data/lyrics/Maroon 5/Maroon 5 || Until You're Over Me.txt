[Verse 1]
This relationship is over,
though my stomach still hurts.
And now I'm gonna live alone,
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup,
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize I've made a big mistake.

[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

[Verse 2]
I never meant to keep you waiting,
and now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.
And now you stand in front of the table,
And say you never look back.
Your super stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad.

[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

No more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.

[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care.

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care.

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
