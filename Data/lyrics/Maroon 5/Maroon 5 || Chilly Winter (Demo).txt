
You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

Baby it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

I get so hungry
But what I got is not enough
Don't got any money
No fancy car and no sexy scars 
But I, Do have something
That you want
And I'll love you till I crumble to the ground, Ooooh!

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

Baby it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York, Oh!

[Solo]

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

Baby it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York, Oh!
