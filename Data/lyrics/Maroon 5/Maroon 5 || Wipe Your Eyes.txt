
I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right I don't wanna fight you

[Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah
'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah

When did we cross the line?
How could we forget?
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

[Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
