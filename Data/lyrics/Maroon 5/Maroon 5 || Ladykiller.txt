
Baby it's not alright
The second that you turn your back she'll be outta sight
Baby she'll break your heart, the second that you spend the night apart
How could you do it? Oh, how could you walk away from everything we made?
How could you do it? Oh, you better watch yourself
I think that girl's insane

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Baby she'll eat you alive, as soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive, before she makes you her latest slaughter
How could you do it? Oh, just come back to me, baby I'm begging please
How could you do it? Oh she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill.

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Instrumental]

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
