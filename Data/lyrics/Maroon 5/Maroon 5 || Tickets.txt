But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu-fu-fucking snob that you'll never know the truth

You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart,
Your perfect little body makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la laaaaaa

I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to get you off

You're perfect on the outside but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart,
Your perfect little body makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la laaaaaa

[Girl singing]
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
La la la la la la la laaaaaa

Yeah...

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la laaaaaa
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
