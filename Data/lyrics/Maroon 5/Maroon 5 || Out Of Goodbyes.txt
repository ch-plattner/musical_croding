[Adam Levine:]
Tell me "action", speak louder
But there's somethin about her words
That hurt

[Lady Antebellum and Adam Levine:]
Closing up, it's so late and
I'm the last one still waitin for you to lock the door

[Lady Antebellum:]
On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
[Lady Antebellum and Adam Levine:]
Only veiled by a thin disguise

[Adam Levine:]
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
[Lady Antebellum and Adam Levine:]
Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes
Out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same
About me
I wonder does your man still shudder
When you touch his hand
Like this man

On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes...
