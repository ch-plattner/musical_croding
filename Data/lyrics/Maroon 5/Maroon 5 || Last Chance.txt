
I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

Oh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (to love you)
Oh oh oh

Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause your the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more

Oh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (to love you)
Oh oh oh

Oh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense

This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh

Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

Oh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance?
Cause this may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)

Oh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me
Oh, oh, oh

Cause this may be the last chance that I get to love you
Oh, oh, oh
To love you
Oh oh oh
