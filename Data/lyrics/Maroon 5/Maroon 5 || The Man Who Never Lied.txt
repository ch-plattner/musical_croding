In the middle of, Hollywood boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, oh, oh, oh, can't take it anymo (oh), oh, oh.
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, oh, oh, oh, it isn't funny anymo (oh), oh, oh.

I was the man who never lied,
Never lied until today.
But I just couldn't break your heart,
Like you did mine yesterday.
I was the man who never lied, oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo.
I was the man who never lied, oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo, yeah.

Sometimes honesty, is the worst, policy.
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, oh, oh, you never need to know, oh, oh.
I don't wanna be, picking up, all of these, tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your hea-a-art. Won't do it anymo (oh), oh, oh.

I was the man who never lied,
I never lied until today.
But I just couldn't break your heart,
Like you did mine yesterday.
I was the man who never lied, oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo.
I was the man who never lied, oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo.

I was the (I was the)... yeah... yeah-aaah... ohh... ohh.

In the middle of Hollywood boulevard,
What am I doin, Hollywood boulevard,
In the middle of Hollywood boulevard,
Screaming at each other, screaaam.

I was the man who never lied,
I never lied until today.
But I just couldn't break your heart,
Like you did mine yesterday.

(I was the man) I was the man who never lied,
(Yeah, I was that man) Never lied until today (Oooh)
But I just couldn't break your heart, (Oooh)
Like you did mine yesterday (Yeah, yeah)
I was the man who never lied (yeah, I was that man), oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo
(I was the man)
I was the man who never lied (I was the man), oooOOOooo oooOOO OOOooo
(Yeah)
