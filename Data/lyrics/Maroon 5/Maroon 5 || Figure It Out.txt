
I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed 
Her need- celophane 
I'm happy you like to play games 
Why did you run away?

We could spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And i can see your getting it
So lets figure it out let's go. 

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that your passionate
Im happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last 
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice its gotta be

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And i can see your getting it

So figure it out lets go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me 
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy your going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard 
Scream loud as we come apart

We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And i can see your getting it
So figure it out lets go

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And i can see your getting it
So figure it out lets go
Figure it out lets go
Figure it out lets go
Figure it out lets
Go
