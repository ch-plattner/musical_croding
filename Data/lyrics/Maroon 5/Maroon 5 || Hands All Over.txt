Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me (x2)
(Put your hands all over me)

I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay and she got up and ran away
Well now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up

Chorus
Put your hands all over me please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away

(Put your hands all over me) ooh oh!

Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough

Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset

Chorus
Put your hands all over me please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
All over me

So come down off your cloud
Say it now say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl come make my day

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Yeah (All over me)

Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me
