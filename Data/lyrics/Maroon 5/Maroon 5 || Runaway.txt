
What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified

What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
'Cause at 4am, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life?
Oh

[Chorus:]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and
I don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
It's my twisted way of keeping you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or do you get along on your own?

[Chorus]

And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?

[Chorus x2]

Runaway, runaway
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway

Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway
