Yeah...oh

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I have been there before and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them, oh

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be, oh
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me?

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you-you-you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

If I ain't got you with me baby
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world, doesn't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby

[Spoken:]
We love ya Alicia Keys.
