
I'm not a fortune teller
I won't be bringing news of what tomorrow brings
I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller
Don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future
Can't see nothing at all

It doesn't mean I'm afraid
Of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by
No matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I'll never know
How the future will go
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change,
But I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller

I don't like watching TV
I don't know what it all means
And your american dream,
Baby, it just isn't me
I know that what I'm thinking
May not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing
Is not your favorite kind

It doesn't mean I'm afraid
Of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by
No matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I'll never know
How the future will go
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change,
But I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller

This feeling keeps growing,
These rivers keep flowing.
How can I have answers when you drown me in questions?

I'll never know
How the future will go
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change,
But I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller

I'll never know
How the future will go
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change,
But I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm not a fortune teller
