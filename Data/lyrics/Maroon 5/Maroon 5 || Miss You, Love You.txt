This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you.

going south, kiss your mouth, lick my lips
Grab your hips, cant remember why I fell in love with this.

But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time 'cause oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again
'cause I don't need you

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face,
So don't go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, your love's not real
'cause the love that I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel

But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time 'cause oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again 'cause oh no
I don't need you tonight

It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
got bills to pay, get out my way it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time 'cause oh no
You beg me you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'cause oh no, I don't need you
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time 'cause oh no
You beg me, you ask me to
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'cause oh no, I don't need you tonight
