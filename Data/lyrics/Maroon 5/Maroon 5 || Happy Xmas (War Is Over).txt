
So this is Christmas, and what have you done?
Another year over, a new one just begun
And so this Christmas, I hope you had fun
Near and the dear ones, the old and the young

A very merry Christmas, and a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one, without any fear

And so this is Christmas, for weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones, the world is so wrong
So happy Christmas, for black and for white!
For yellow and red ones! Let's stop all the fight!

A very merry Christmas, and a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear

And so this Christmas, what have we done?
Another year over, a new one just begun
And so happy Christmas, we hope you had fun
Near and the dear ones, the old and the young

A very merry Christmas, and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear!

War is over, if you want it
War is over now
