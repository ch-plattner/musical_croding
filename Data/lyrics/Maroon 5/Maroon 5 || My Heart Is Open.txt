I know you're scared, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that, too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it (no)

One more no and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say "No", say "No" to me

It won't take me long to find another lover but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

You don't have to say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say yeah
'Cause my heart is open
Now ya gotta say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say, wanna hear ya say, wanna hear ya say

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if ya do I know that I won't let ya down (no)

Ya so hand it over trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I see your face

Oh, and I don't need time to find another lover but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

You don't have to say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say yeah
'Cause my heart is open
Now ya gotta say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say yeah
Wanna hear ya say, wanna hear ya say, wanna hear ya say

Yes yes yes
Yes yes yes
