
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

Hazel eyes I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realized

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always youu
Youuu
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you always you

All my hidden desires finally came alive
No I never told a lie to you so why would I start tonight

Hazel eyes I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realized

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always youu
Youuu
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you always you

Ahhhhhh oooooo
You ou ou ou ou (repeat)
Ahhhhh oooo
You ou ou ou ou (repeat)

Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always youu
Youuu
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you always you
