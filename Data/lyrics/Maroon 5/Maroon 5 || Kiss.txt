You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me (Yeah)
You can't be too flirty, mama
And I know how to undress me (Yeah)
I want to be your fantasy
And maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
See act your age not your shoe size
(Not your shoe size)
An I could show you how to do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
Just leave it all up to me
My love will be your fool
Yeah

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
