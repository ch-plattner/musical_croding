
Feeling mighty blue
By myself
One ol' lonesome shoe
By myself
Now that love's behind me
You'll find me
By myself

I just sit and stare
At the floor
Just don't seem to care
Anymore
Since my baby's gone
Got a padlock on my door

That old black cat
Keeps hangin' 'round
But I ain't blaming him
'Cause things are bad
It ain't his fault
I've gone and lost
The only love
I ever had

Love
Love
I miss him so
It's no lie
And I'm so "double o"
I could die
So I'll be
Just me here
By myself
