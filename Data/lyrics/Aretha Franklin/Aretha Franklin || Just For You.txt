
I’ll say goodbye to all that old friends
Just for you, just for you
If we can be together, just we two

I’ll stay at home all week and weekends
If you’ll be there with me
Our lust will be a drift, you just wait and see

I’ll forget the old days
When running around was fun
Through the years and always
You’ll be the only one

I’ll save my love and my affection
Just for you, I’ll be true
As long as I may live, I’ll live just for you
