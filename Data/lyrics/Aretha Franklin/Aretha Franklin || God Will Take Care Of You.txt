
Be not dismayed whatever betide you, you need to know
(God will take care of you)
Beneath His wings of love abide you, you need to know
(God will take care of you)
Through days of toil when heart does fail
When dangers fierce your path assail, you better remember

[Chorus:]
God will take care of you,
Through every day (through every day)
All of the way
God will take care of you; He will take care of you

All you may need (all you may need) He will provide,
(God will take care of you)
Nothing you ask, my friend, will be denied,
(God will take care of you)

No matter what (no matter what)
May be the test (may be the test)
Lean, weary one (lean, weary one)
Safe in his rest (safe in his rest)
And you just remember that you know

[Chorus]

Through your trials and through your storms
When it seems you can't hold on
Trouble is on ever side, cried so much you just can't cry no more
They can talk about you, laugh about you, say that it's over
But it's not over until God says it's over
Remember that he is always faithful
You serve a God who's able to take care of you

[Chorus x2]
