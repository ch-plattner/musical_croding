Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Sister, think

Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Brother, think

But don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

He sees every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Are you sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
You'd better think

Are you sure
Real sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
Brother, think

Don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
