My darling, oooo darling
How long I have waited for you
Need your touch
Love me? How much?
Just trust me
We both knew this would be

Darling, ohh darling
Darling, you are first
Your touching, ohh I'm blushing
You're my water that quenches my thirst

I felt you near, and now you're here
Kissed from above
Darling, this is our love
My open arms
I'm waiting here, to be held close
Let go of all of your fears

My darling, ohh darling
Honey, you are first
Your touching, ooooo I'm blushing
You're my water that quenches my thirst

I know who you are
I understand
I love what I see
A prince, and king of a man
Unopened doors
Darling, if you're mine, I am yours

My darling, oooo darling
How long I've waited for you
I need your touch
Love me? How much?
Just trust me
We both knew that this would be

We're holding on
Darling, be strong
A mountain climb
Can be rocky sometime
An equal love
We hold so dear
It is real my love
oooo I wish you were here
My darling ooo darling
You are, you are, worth waiting for
With every taste I want more
You sho' make my life sweet,
This is no trick
Ooooo I am your treat....
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah I am, oooo I am your treat....

Love you deeply, so completely
Stop risking everything....baby damn
You don't have to,
It's beneath you
You don't realize
You are and I am
ummm you are and I am
Darling darling oooo darling I'm so glad you're here.
