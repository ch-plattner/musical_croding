
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out of the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out
And I'll lay your ship bare
See how I will leave with every part of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out of the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking we almost had it all
The scars of your love, it keeps me breathless
I can't help thinking

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have
No story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me
In the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking we almost had it all
The scars of your love keep me breathless
I can't help thinking

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Yeah, but you played this to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand, boy
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Ah, but you played this to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
To the beat, beat, beat, beat

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasure gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You know that there ain't no mountain high enough)
I'm still in love with you, oh, boy
(Ain't no valley low enough)
You're one and only, you are my heart
(Ain't no river wide enough)
(To keep me from getting to you)
There ain't no my mountain, it ain't no, yeah, yeah

(You know that there ain't no mountain high enough)
There ain't no mountain high enough
(Ain't no valley low enough)
If you go to trouble
(Ain't no river wide enough)
I'll be there, oh, baby
(To keep me from getting to you, babe)
Yes I will

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, bro
But you played this to the beat
(Rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Honey, honey, honey, yeah, yeah
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I'm still in love with you, yeah, I'm trying
(You're gonna wish you, rolling in the deep)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
