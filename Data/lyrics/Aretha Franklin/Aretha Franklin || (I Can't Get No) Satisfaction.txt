I can't get no satisfaction
And I try
I tell ya, I try
Believe me, I try
I sure enough try
But I can't get no
I can't get no
No

When I'm drivin' in my car
And a man comes on the radio
Tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
That's supposed to power my imagination
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, what I say, yeah
Aw, baby, that's what I say
Yes, it is
Hey-hey-hey
Aw, baby, that's what I say
Sure enough
I tell you that 
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try
Baby, I try
Yeah, believe me I try
Sure enough try
But I can't get no
I can't get no
No

Well, I don't know what I can do
When I just can't do no more
Each thing new and different  I try
Seems to turn out to be one big bore
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, yeah-yay-hey
Oh, baby, that's what I say
Said I'm fed up
Hey-yeah-yeah
Oh, that's what I say
Yes, it is
I can't get me no satisfaction
All I need is some social reaction
Yeah, yeah
Ohh-ah-yeah
Hey, I can't get no satisfaction
I need social reaction
Yeah-yay
Ohh-ah-yeah
