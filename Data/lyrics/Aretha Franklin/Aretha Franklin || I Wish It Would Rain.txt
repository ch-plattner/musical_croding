Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside 
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain, 
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face 
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying, 
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears, 
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride 
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.
