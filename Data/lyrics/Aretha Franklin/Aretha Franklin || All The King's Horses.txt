
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
I woke up this mornin' that this is what I found.
You had gone and left me,
Any you never even made a farewell sound.

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
I asked my friends about you and this is what they said,
"She can live without you, 
She's gonna find a man with money instead."

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
Someday you will know, the meaning of a love that's true.
But when you find out I won't be around to share it with you.

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
