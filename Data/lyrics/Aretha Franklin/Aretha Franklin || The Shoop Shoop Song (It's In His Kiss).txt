I wanna know!
How can I tell if he loves me so?

(Is it in his eyes?)
Oh no! You'll be deceived!
(Is it in his size?)
Oh no! He'll make believe!
If you wanna know,
If he loves you so,
It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)

(Oh yeah! Or is it in his face?)
No girls! It's just his charms!
(In his warm embrace?)
No girls! That's just his arms!
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)
Yeah! It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)

Oh, oh, oh, hold him, 
Squeeze him tight!
Find out what you wanna know!
Promise love, and if it really is,
Well, it's there in his kiss!

(How 'bout the way he acts?)
No no no! That's not the way!
You're not listenin' to all I say!
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!) 
Oh, yeah! It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)

Oh, oh, oh, hold him, 
Squeeze him tight!
Find out what you wanna know!
Promise love, and if it really is,
Well, It's there in his kiss!

(How 'bout the way he acts?)
No no no! That's not the way!
You're not listenin' to all I say!
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!) 
Oh, yeah! It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)
Mmmm! It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is) 
Mmmm it's in his kiss
