I know the Lord
Will make a way
Yes, He will
I know the Lord
Will make a way
Yes, He will
He'll make
A way for you
He will lead you
Safely through
I know the Lord
Will make a way
Yes, He will

I have a Savior
Who I can tell
All my troubles to
When I'm burdened
And don't know
What to do
I can go to Him
In secret prayer
And I can leave
All my burdens
There
I know the Lord
Will make a way
