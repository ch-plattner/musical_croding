
This is my same old coat, these are my same old shoes;
It was the same old me, with the same old blues...
Oh, then you touched my life just by holding my hand,
And when I look in the mirror, I see a brand new girl, oh, man!

Just because of you, boy;
Just because of you... whoa, oh, oh...
Just because of you, boy;
Just because of you...

I got the same old friends, and they've got the same old sins;
I tell them the same old jokes, and I get the same old grins...
But now the joke is on you - It happened somehow with you;
Everyday of my life, I'm as fresh as morning dew!

Just because of you, (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, whoa, oh, oh, oh...
Just because of you, boy, (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you...

I go to the same old places, I see the same old faces;
I look at the same old sky, see it all in a brand new light...
I got a brand new boy, and I got me a brand new smile;
Since I found you, baby, I got me a brand new style!

Just because of you, boy! (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! I feel good...
Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! I feel good...

Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Hey! Just because of you! Yes, I do...
Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! It feels good...

Just because of you, boy, yeah, just because of you, ah...
Just because of you, boy, just because, because, because of you...

(Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...
Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...
Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...)
