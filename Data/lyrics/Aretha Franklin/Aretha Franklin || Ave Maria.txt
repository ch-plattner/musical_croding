Ave Maria, maiden mild
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer
For thou can't hear amid the wild
This thou, this thou can't save amid, despair

We slumber safe until tomorrow
Though we by man outcast relieved
Oh, maiden, see a maiden's sorrow
Oh, mother, hear a suppliant child
Ave Maria

Ave Maria, gracia plena
Maria, gracia plena
Maria, gracia plena
Ave, ave dominus

Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu in mulieribus
Et benedictus
Et benedictus fructus ventris
Ventris tuae, Jesus
Ave Maria
