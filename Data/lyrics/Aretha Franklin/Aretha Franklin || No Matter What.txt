
It's funny how 
We've wasted our time 
On so-called friends 
Who are really not on our side 
We've always got something to say 
About us and how we are 
Spending our days 
They're trying to confuse us 
With their lies and deceit 
And they don't care if we 
Live or die on these streets 
But you and I 
We both know the truth 
That we will prevail 
As long as God sees us through 

No matter what they do 
You need to love me 
I ain't out there cheatin'
All on you, you need to trust me 
Wanna see you happy, never blue 
You need to love me 
And just love me 
And just love me 
No matter what your friends 
Are telling you, you need to love me 
'Cause from me 
You'll always hear the truth 
You need to trust me 
I ain't mad at you for being you 
You need to love me 
'Cause I love you 
So just love me 

I wish they would 
Leave us alone 
And let us be together 
Boy, you can't fall victim 
To those fools 
Telling you whatever 
You hear about me on the streets 
And it'll only make you weak 
And put a damper on our situation 
They're trying to tear down our 
Foundation sick and tired of 
Hateration but we gone make it 
As long as we stay patient 

No matter what they do 
You need to love me 
I ain't out there cheatin'
On you, you need to trust me 
Wanna see you happy, never blue 
You need to love me 
And just love me 
And just love me 
No matter what your friends 
Are telling you, you need to love me 
'Cause from me 
You'll always hear the truth 
You need to trust me 
I ain't mad at you for being you 
You need to love me 
'Cause I love you 
So just love me

Why do we waste away our lives 
Playing simple games 
Telling silly lies 
How far will they go 
Till they realize 
What goes around comes around 
We got a love you can't 
Break down

No matter what they do 
You need to love me 
I ain't out there cheatin'
On you, you need to trust me 
Wanna see you happy, never blue 
You need to love me 
And just love me 
And just love me 
No matter what your friends 
Are telling you, you need to love me 
'Cause from me 
You'll always hear the truth 
You need to trust me 
I ain't mad at you for being you 
You need to love me 
'Cause I love you 
So just love me [Repeat]
