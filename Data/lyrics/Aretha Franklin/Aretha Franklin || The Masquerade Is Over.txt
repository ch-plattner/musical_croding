
Your eyes don’t shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I’m afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your kiss don’t mean what it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now it’s just another routine
I’m so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I’ll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown’s disguise
And then I’ll learn to laugh, laugh like Pagliacci, oh, with tears all in my eyes

Hey baby, your kiss don’t mean what it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now it’s just an everytime routine
I’m so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
