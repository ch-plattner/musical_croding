Boyfriend I'm true to you, don't make me blue
I thought we had together and that everythin' was going okay
But than you started showin' me another side of you
I've never seen before

Nothin' that I would do was ever enough for you boy, ooh baby
And that you're drivin' our Mercedes Benz
Loaned you a little cash to spend
But still that just wasn't enough, oh no

'Cause what you see always seems to be what you sweat
Ooh, you're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better, yeah
That's the way you are, wantin' more and more and more

My friends all think I'm crazy after everythin' that I know about you
I'm still havin' mixed emotions boy, they just don't wanna fade away

Nothin' that I would do was ever enough for you boy, ooh baby
I let you cruise in my Mercedes Benz
Loaned you a little cash to spend
Still that just wasn't enough, oh

What you see always seems to be what you sweat
Ooh, you're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better, yeah
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, always wantin' somethin' better, yeah

He's sweatin', he's got to conquer, he's sweatin' by the hour
He's sweatin', he's got the taste, still sweatin' on the flower
He's sweatin', he can't stand it
He's makin' moves that's how he planned it
He's not satisfied with the best, he' got to check out all the rest

Nothin' that I would do would ever enough for you boy
You wanna have my Mercedes Benz
Gave you a little cash to spend
Still that just wasn't enough, oh no

What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, always wantin' somethin' better

What you see, you're never satisfied
Always wantin' somethin' better
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
Always wantin' somethin' better
