
Maybe I'm a fool
For loving you so
And maybe
Maybe I'm a fool
I don't, I don't really know
But I can't
I can't stop loving you
Darling, oh yes
Though I tried, oh yes

And maybe
Maybe your goodbye was so mean
So mean and unfair
Though you made me cry
My love's still there
And I know, I know
That I'll long for your kisses, oh
Until I die
Oh yes, until I die

Well, I said all of my friends
All of my friends have told me
They said
"Aretha, why don't you find
You really need to find
Somebody new"
Yeah, oooh yeah
But what they don't know
What they just don't know
Is in my heart
I'd missing, oh
That that someone was you

So, oh, it's all for you to decide
If you should decide
To trap me once more
All you got to do
All you got to do is knock on my door
And I'll say
I'll say that I've taken you back

Yeah, taking you back would be folish
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'm a fool
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
