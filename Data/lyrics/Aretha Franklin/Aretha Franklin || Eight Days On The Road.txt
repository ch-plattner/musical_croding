Sugar baby, be my saviour
‘Cause I’m tired, I’m tired, I’ve been eight days on the road, eh (that’s right?)
That’s right, yes it is, eight days on the road
Travelin’ through the night
There ain’t no town, there ain’t no town
There ain’t no rest tonight, yeah (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

I’m in and busted, standing on the county line (it does)
And that’s why, yeah, that’s why I’ve been eight days on the road, yeah (eight days on the road)
Now, that’s right, yes it is, eight days on the road (it does)
Travelin’ through the night
There ain’t no town, there ain’t no town
There ain’t no rest tonight (eight days on the road)

I’m here out thinkin’, thinkin’, I’m thinkin’ ’bout of what I’ve done (what I’ve done)
And that’s why, yeah, I’ve been eight days on the road, ah (eight days on the road)
That’s right, oooh, eight days on the road
Travelin’ through the night
I’m comin’ my home, It won’t be long
I’ll make Birmingham tonight (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Yes I will, yes I will (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

I’m makin’ it back to you, baby, come on (anymore)
I’m makin’ it back to you, baby, yeah (anymore)
I’m makin’ it back to you, baby, no way (anymore)
I’m makin’ it back to you, baby (anymore)

Oooh, eight days (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Eight days on the road, uuuh
Yeah, that’s right, yes it is (eight days on the road, uuuh)
I’ve been eight days on the road, yeah
Ooh, I’ve been sucked (sucked)
I’ve been eight days on the road, uuuh (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Oooh, yes it is, I’ve been eight days on the road (eight days on the road, uuuh)
