
At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street

I know that time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
But tonight we will meet at the dark end of the street

They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me

And when the daylight roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me

They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
