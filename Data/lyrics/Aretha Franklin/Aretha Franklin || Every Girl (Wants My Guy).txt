Every girl wants my guy (My guy) 
And I can understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they ain't never gonna get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

Oh, I'm hot tonight like dynamite
So I know I can keep that man
When it comes to love I'm a cut above 
Any other woman
I'm a rough and tough and ready girl (Ow)
So don't you even try it
He can never find any love like mine
So don't you know you're wasting time?

Every girl wants my guy (My guy) 
And I do understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they ain't never gonna get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?
Every girl wants my guy (My guy) 
And I do understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they ain't never gonna get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

When they see my guy walking down the street
The other guys are mesmerized
He's the kind of guy that they wanna be
But they know not to even try
He's a rough and tough and a ready guy (Ow)
So I don't even worry about
Any girl who thinks she can turn his eye
I feel bad for her when she finds out

Every girl wants my guy (My guy) 
And I do understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they ain't never gonna get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?
Every girl wants my guy (My guy) 
And I do understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they ain't never gonna get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

Check it out. Dig on it, dig on it.

[Spoken] Hello? Hey, Kitty Girl. What's happenin'
Oh, same old thing. Girls trying to jerk me for my man.
Um hmm. Oh yeah, Mm hmm. Miss Thang is really after him.
Uh huh. Yeah, but you know, I'm going for a black out with him.
Oh yeah, girl, he's been snatched by me now.
We are full search, for sure
He is so totally tubular. (We want your guy)
Who is... who is that? Who else is on the line?
Kitty, do you have a party line? Well, let me tell you all something.

I'm hot tonight like dynamite
So I know I can keep that man
When it comes to love I'm a cut above
Ooo, any other woman
I'm a rough and tough and ready girl (Ow)
So don't you even try it
He can never find any love like mine
So don't you know you're wasting time?

Every girl wants my guy (My guy)

[Spoken] And as for you, as for you, Dolly Poo... 
Don't even worry about it. Have you looked in your mirror lately?
You better dust it off because you are r-u-i-n-g. Ha ha.
