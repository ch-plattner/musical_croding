But you can't beat me
I'm a roadrunner honey
But you can't beat me
Bye,bye, my baby
Baby, baby, you will see
I'm a heart for you baby
But your out of my class
I'm a heart for you baby
But your out of my class
Bye, bye my baby
Baby, baby, you will see

I'm a roadrunner honey
But you can't beat me
I'm a roadrunner honey
But you can't beat me
Bye,bye, my baby
Baby, baby, you will see
I'm a heart for you baby
But your out of my class
I'm a heart for you baby
But your out of my class
Bye, bye my baby
Baby, baby, you will see

I'm a roadrunner honey
I'm a roadrunner honey
I'm a roadrunner honey
I'm a roadrunner honey
Bye, bye, bye baby
Baby baby you will see
