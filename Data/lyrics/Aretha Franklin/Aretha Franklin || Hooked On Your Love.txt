Your tender smile gives me happy thoughts of you
You got me so close to my dreams now they have to come true
Ooh baby, nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope lovin' you don't confuse you
Ooh baby baby, I don't wanna lose you

And when we touch our hearts move at a steady pace
I'm tryin' hard not to show the blushin' over my face
Ooh yeah yeah, you bring out the woman in me
What can I see that you can't see?
I like the way we carry on
Hope you understand my feelings got me just a reeling

What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love
What can I do with this sweet feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love, ooh

Your eyes within me, they send me just a starin' me down
I'm so turned on in time and child, I got to move around
Ooh yes I do, over and over you astound me
I take pleasure to have you around me
My lovin' arms would love to squeeze you
Ooh baby take it, I don't want to tease you

What can I do, ooh with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can I do?
What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
Ooh

Nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope lovin' you don't confuse you
Hope you understand these feelings me got me just a reeling

What can I do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love, love
Oh what can I do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love

What can I do?
What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love

What can I do?
What can I do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can I do with this feeling?
