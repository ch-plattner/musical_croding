
Ooh, hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas

Oh, the fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a, a very special Christmas for me, yeah, yeah

Oh, presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you, this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do, this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a, a very special Christmas for me, yeah, ooh

Merry Christmas
Shake your hand, shake your hand, yeah, ooh

Oh, the fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a very special Christmas for me, oh

Shake your hand, shake your hand, yeah
Do you feel [?] all over the world
Shake your hand, shake your hand, yeah
All over the world, Merry Christmas
