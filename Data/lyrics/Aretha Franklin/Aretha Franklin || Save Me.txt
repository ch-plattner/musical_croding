
Save me, somebody save me...
Save me, somebody save me... yeah...

Promised myself after the first romance,
I wouldn't give ya a second chance...
They say if you seek, you're sure to find,
But the closer I get to you, baby, you drive me stone outta my mind...

Save me! Oh, yeah...
Save me! Yeah, yeah...

Those who love always give the most;
We're cryin' together from coast to coast...
Love leaves us cold and hurt inside,
These tears of ours, unjustified...

Beggin' you to save me! Yeah, need somebody to
Save me! Yeah... hey, hey, hey...

Yeah... Mm-hmm... 
Yeah... Mm-hmm...

You lied and said you needed me!
You abused my love, set me free...
You didn't need, you didn't want me;
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me!

I'm beggin' you to, oh, save me... hey...
Please, save me...

Callin' the Cape Crusader, Green Hornet, Kado too;
I'm in so much trouble, I don't know what to do...
If you think anything about me, save me! 
Oh yeah, yeah, c'mon...
Understand! Save me! 
Anybody! Save me!
Whoo! Oh, oh, oh, save me!
Whoo! Oh, oh, oh, save me!
