Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing. 
If you should loo-oo-se me, 
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing. 

You know I love you, 
Do anything for you. 
Just don't mistreat me, 
An I'll be good to you. 
'Cause if you should loo-oo-se me, 
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing. 

I'm givin' you one more chance, 
For you to do right. 
If you'll only straighen up, 
We'll have a good life. 
'Cause if you should loo-oo-se me, 
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing. 

This is my last time, 
Not asking any more. 
If you don't do right, 
I'm gonna march outta that door. 
And if you don't be-lee-eeve me, 
Just try it, daddy, 
An you'll lose a good thing. 

Just try it, daddy, 
An you'll lose a good thing. 

Just try it, daddy, 
An you'll lose a good thing.
