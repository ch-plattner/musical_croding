There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

I see your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together
Together, baby, together, together, together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing
