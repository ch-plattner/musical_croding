It's time to jam, y'all 
Freaks, get up against the wall 
And let's rock, hey 

Ooh, ooh, yeah 

No longer will I do all 
The things that I used to do 
Stood by your side in innocence 
For my love was just for you 

Well, I'm a big girl now 
With big needs and desires 
So don't you come around 
If you can't take me higher 

I like to rock a lot 
Throw my love away 
On on only one boy 
I like to rock a lot 
That's how it is of lately 
Hey, hey, yeah 

I like to rock a lot 
I'll take a path and stay 
Yes, I will now 
I like to rock a lot 
Big boy, ooh 

Rock, rock, rock... 
Oh, yeah, I like to party 
Yeah, ooh... 

I think it's my turn this time 
Not a soul gets by 
Games never had no place with me 
Jamming is my concern 

Just give me one good man 
To keep me satisfied 
Have you gone underground 
And if so, where will you hide 
Sweet thing, hey 

I like to rock a lot 
Throw my love away 
On on only one 
I like to rock a lot 
That's how it is of lately 
Yeah, baby 

I like to rock a lot 
Take a path and stay. oh, baby 
I like to rock a lot 
Big boy, I am, ooh 

Rock, rock, rock... 

It's time to rock with Rebe 
Yes, it is 
Rocking is my soul's desire 
And I'm gonna set you on fire 

Oh, oh, oh... 

I like to rock a lot 
Throw my love away, oh, baby 
I like to rock a lot 
That's how it is of lately 
Oh, yes, it is now 

I like to rock a lot 
Take a path and stay, oh, yeah 
I like to rock a lot 
Big boy, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah 

Rock, rock, rock... 

Step on the funk now 
Well, well 
Freeze the funk, y'all 

I tried to warn you 
I tried to warn you 
Yeah, yeah... 

Rock, rock, rock... 

I like it, I like it 
I like it, I like it...
