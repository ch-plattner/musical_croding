In this world it's hard 
You know 
Lovers come and lovers go 

People never seem to hold on to what they've got. 
Some they never stay together 
You and I will be no better 

We can make it last forever 
We can keep this love alive. 

Through the storm 
Through the tears 

You and I 
I know we can survive. 
To the day 
Through the night 

If we try we can keep it alive 
We can keep it alive. 

I know sometimes it's been so tough 
We've been so close to giving up 
But our love's so strong and we keep holding on 

Yeah 
To what we got. 
It's easier to walk away 
It takes a lot of love to stay 

We've got all the love it takes 
We know there's a brighter day. 

Through the storm 
Through the tears 

You and I 
I know we can survive. 
To the day 
Through the night 

If we try we can keep it alive 
We can keep it alive. 

We just gotta be strong 
We just gotta be strong 

We just gotta be strong together 

We just gotta hold on 
We just gotta hold on 

We just gotta hold on and go through the storm. 

Through the storm 
Through the tears 

You and I 
I know we can survive. 
To the day 
Through the night 

If we try we can keep it alive 
We can keep it alive. 

Through the storm 
Through the tears 

You and I 
I know we can survive. 
To the day 
Through the night 

If we try we can keep it alive 
We can keep it alive
