Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm gonna miss you, but believe, while I'm away...
That I didn't mean to hurt you;
Don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself, I'd hurt myself...)

Baby, baby, baby (baby), think of me sometimes (baby);
Because if loving you was so wrong (baby), then I'm guilty of this crime...
(Guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty...)
I'm bewildered, I'm lonely, and I'm loveless,
Without you to hold my hand (Reach out for me, boy...);
If you'd just understand... (Reach out to me, right now...)

Those that we love, we foolishly make cry,
Then sometimes feel it's best to say goodbye, goodbye...
But what's inside can't be denied;
The power (power of love), power of love (power of love) is my only guide...
Baby! (Oh...), Baby! (Oh...) 
Baby (Oh...), baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
Just how much I'm really gonna miss you, but believe, while I'm away,
(I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you...)
That I really didn't mean, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to hurt you;
Don't you know that, that I'd rather hurt myself? (I'd hurt myself...)

Baby... I need you, I need you, I need you (I need you, I need you, I need you...)
If I did you wrong, if I did you wrong... (I'd hurt myself...)
I need you, I need you, I need you (I need you, I need you, I need you...)
If I did you wrong... (I'd hurt myself...)
