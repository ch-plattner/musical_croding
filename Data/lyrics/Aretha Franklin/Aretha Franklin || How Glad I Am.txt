My love has no beginning, my love has no end,
No front no back, my love won't bend,
I'm in the middle, I'm lost in a spin
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love won't drop
I'm in the middle, and I can't stop
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

I wish I was a poet, so that I could express,
What I, what I like to say,
I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today

My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love wider than wide,
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide,
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
No you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am
