I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes, I am
I'm never a loser and I'm never a quitter yet, oh, no
'Cause I take what I want, baby, I want you, yeah, you

I've been watchin' you walk by and I haven't said a word, one word
But now I'm ready to get you and I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl
'Cause I take what I want, baby, I want you, yes, you

Gonna pick you up now, carry you away
So you better pack up now, baby, pack a bag today
Here I come, just a big bad man
When I walk away, baby, you'll be holdin' my hand

I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes, I am
I'm never a loser and I'm never a quitter yet, oh, no
'Cause I take what I want, baby, I want you, yeah, you
'Cause I take what I want, baby, I want you, yeah, you

Nobody but you, baby, nobody but you, baby
To be by my side, nobody but you, baby
Tell you what I want, girl, I want you

I'm your lovin' man
I'm your lovin' man
I'm your lovin' man
I'm your lovin' man
