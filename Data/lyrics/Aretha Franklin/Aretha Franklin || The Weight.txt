
I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No," was all he said.

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "Well I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

Go down, Moses, there's nothin' that you can say
It's just like ol' Luke waitin', waitin' on Judgement Day.
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favour, stay an' keep Anna Lee some company."

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

Catch me a cannon ball, now take me on down the line
My bag is sinkin' low, and I believe that it's about time.
To get in touch with Annie, you know she's the one.
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone?

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.
