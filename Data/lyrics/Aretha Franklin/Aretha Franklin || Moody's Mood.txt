There I go, there I go, there I go
There I go,
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave

You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave

Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you

Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away

There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain

I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And give a relief from this awful misery?

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me?
Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without
And never knowing what love's about

James Moody, you can come on in man
And you can blow now if you want to

We're through.
