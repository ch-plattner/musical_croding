
Tell me if you love me
Right now
Tell me if you want me
Right now
You make me think you like it
When we kiss
But still you never say so

So if you're only playing
LetÂ´s stop
Cause you're nearly blowing my top
And if you can say you do
But if you don't
Baby tell me right now

You've got a smile I love
And you've a style I love
And your caress
Is all my heart is dreaming of

But if you keep stalling
By the time we click
I'll be turning gray
And you'll be walking
With this trick

So if we're gonna make it
Let's start
Cause you're overworking my heart
I confess that I'm with you
And you with me
But tell me right now

You've got
You've got a smile I love
And God knows you've the style I love
And your caress
Is all my heart is dreaming of

But if you keep stalling
By the time we click
I'll be turning gray
And you'll be walking
With this trick

So if we're gonna make it
We've got to start
Cause you're overworking my heart
And you're the guy that I love
That I can't deny
And all you ever give me
Is just an alibi
And baby I've decided
Now it's do or die
So tell me if you love me
Oh tell me if you love me
I wanna know now
I wanna know now
Yes right now
Hmmm
