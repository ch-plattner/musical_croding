
Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory

Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes I did
I escaped (ahaha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh huh

With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet

And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me (oh)
I knew you were waiting (hey)
Knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
Ooh, boy (ooh)
I know this love we share was meant to be (oh)

Knew you were waiting (Ooh, yeah)
Knew you were waiting (I knew you were waiting)
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (I didn't falter, no)
I still believed (When the valley was low)
It didn't stop me (Nothing can stop me, no)
I knew you were waiting (No I)
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (When the mountain was high)
I still believed (Oh, when the valley was low)
It didn't stop me (No, it didn't stop me, no)
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (Oh, oh yeah)
I still believed (I still believed)
It didn't stop me (You know it couldn't stop me now)
Knew you were waiting
Someday (Someday), somehow (somehow)
For me

I didn't falter (When the valley was low)
I still believed (I still believed)
He didn't stop me (No, he didn't stop me, no)
No way
