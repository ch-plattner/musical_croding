You told me that you would leave me here in tears.
Now you're gone and hours seem like years.
So darling, I sing my song.
Your leaving makes my heart beat slow and slow
Now I'm wondering where did you go.
Please tell me, tell me what is wrong.

I still love you, 
Won't you please come back to me?
Come back where, where you ought to be. 
Don't stay away from me
Cause you'll always be my own,
We'll be together for eternity.

You told me that you would leave me here in tears.
Now you're gone and hours seem like years.
And you left me singing a song,
I'm just singing a song,
You left me singing a song...
