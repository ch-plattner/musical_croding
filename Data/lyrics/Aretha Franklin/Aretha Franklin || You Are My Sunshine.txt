Some rain has sure got to fall
Oooh, they tell me here, that everybody
Has sure, has sure got to cry sometime (cry)
And, oh, if some rain (some rain)
If some rain has got to fall (some rain)
On everybody, and I’ve had enough rain in my life
Then I’m so glad right now

To keep the rain off my head, yeah, yeah
And I believe it’s, I believe it’s
I believe it’s because (tell me what do you believe)

On the other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you, I held you in my arms, yeah
But when I woke up and found out I was mistaken, yeah
You know that I hung my (you know that I hung my)
Hung my head and I cried (head and I cried)

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby)
You are my sunshine (baby)
You sure make me happy, baby, oh, when the skies are grey
And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don’t want you to take my (oh baby, don’t you take my)
Take my sunshine away (shining away)

You told me once, you did it, that you really loved me
And no one else could ever, could ever come between, yeah
But now you’re thinking about to leaving me (leaving)
For another, yeah (leaving)
If you do you know you’re gonna shatter
Shatter every one of my dreams (all of my dreams)

Because, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby)
You are my sunshine (baby)
You sure make me good and happy, oh, when the skies are grey
And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you (how much I really need you)

Baby, don’t you take my (oh, baby, don’t you take my)
You promised me (oh, baby, don’t you take my)
That you’ll never, never, never, never leave me
You promised me (sunshine, shown off)
That you’ll never, never, never deceive me (sunshine, shown off)
Good God almighty, don’t let him (sure enough)
Don’t let him take it away (oh, baby, don’t you take my)
Hey, baby, good God almighty (oh, baby, don’t you take my)
