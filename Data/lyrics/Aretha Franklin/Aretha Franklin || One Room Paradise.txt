I don’t need no diamonds (she don’t need)
And I don’t need no money (she don’t need, she don’t)
Some people live in castles with sixty or seventy rooms (she don’t)
Some people dream about a penthouse doll or a mansion on the moon
But I got me a little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And that’s all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Some girls are crazy about diamonds (diamonds)
Some go wild about perls (go wild)
Some girls go for a lot of loot from a check book that ain’t hers (sho’ ain’t hers)
But I got me a little one room to paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And that’s all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Now, if one day he lucks up on a magic pot of gold (pot of gold)
I wouldn’t mind a little diamond ring or a fur coat for the cold  (ooh)
But if it meant I had to lose just what I’ve got right now (right now)
Then I don’t need no gold anyhow (no, no, oh)

I can’t make love with no diamonds (diamonds)
Give them all to somebody else (anybody)
And what good is one hundred rooms if you’re debtor by yourself (yes, you)
So I’ll take me my little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
Well, that’s all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

I don’t need no diamonds (she don’t need no diamonds)
Said I don’t need no money (she don’t need no money, she don’t)
