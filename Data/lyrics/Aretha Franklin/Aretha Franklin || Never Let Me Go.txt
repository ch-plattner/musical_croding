Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling won't
You hold me tight
And never let
Never let me go

Cry your eyes
No tears no sorrow
Cling to me
With all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more
We said we'd never never never never part
Ah but lately
Lately I find
That you're a stranger
A stranger in my heart
Give me give me give me

Give me the night
In summer or in springtime
To tell the world
That you're the you're and you're everything of mine
And you'll never
Oh never let me go
No
You'll never let me go
