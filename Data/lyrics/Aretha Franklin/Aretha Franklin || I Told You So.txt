
I hate to say, I told you so
Though you deserve it, because you know
You left me crying for someone new
But all the heartache came back to you
Now you’re begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

When you were king and ridding high
You thought your new love would never die
While you were laughing, I cried alone
You wouldn’t hear from me a bomb
Now you’re begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

I think you’re so, I know you should’ve reap
I told you so, I told you so
You are alone and look before you leap
I told you so, I told you so
You can’t win when you’re a jumpin’ jack
I told you so, I told you so

I hate to say, I told you so
We lived in closely and said it slow
When you were leaving I told you then
You’re needing ever come back again
So let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
So let me, let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
