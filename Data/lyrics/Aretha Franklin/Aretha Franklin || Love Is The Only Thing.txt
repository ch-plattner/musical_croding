I love and you love
We love
Sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I kiss and you kiss
Each kiss sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I'm lucky
And you're lucky too
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

I give and you give
We live for love
Each night
Each day
We love sweet love
Cause ain't it so?
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all
