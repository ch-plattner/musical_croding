I've looked around all over town
And I'm so lonely and so blue
I've looked around and all over
But I can't find nobody like you, you, you, yeah

Now, it's all so lonely since you went away
And I don't know what to do
I've looked around all over, over
I just can't find nobody, nobody like you

Tears seem to fall when I'm away, oh, when I'm away from you
And I've tried to understand the reason why
And now I know it's all, it's all because I love you, I love you so much
My heart is yours until the day that I die

And oh, why don't you hold me
Hold me and never, never let me go?
Why don't you, why don't you love me, love me
And vanish all thoughts of sorrow?
I love you, I love you, just can't find nobody like you
