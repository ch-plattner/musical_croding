
Two sides
Two sides of love can make me wonder
Can lift me up or pull me under
The different ways that you can be bother me

Cause there are sometimes
You treat me nice and whisper so sweetly
You make me feel you’re mine completely
And when you hold me like you do then I love you

But then there goes times
You smile at girls
Start me wonder if worth being fail and so down
You make me feel you don’t want me around

You’re making me a girl with two sides
One part of me can never, ever trust you
The other part keeps wanting just you
So if you find I’m acting strange
Then you’re the one who made me change

You’re making me a girl with two sides
One part of me can never trust you
The other part keeps wanting just you
So if you find I’m acting strange
Then you’re the one who made me change, ah, ah

You took my love and you tore it all apart
Took my heart right from the start
You’re making me a girl with two sides
Look at me, I’ve got two sides
