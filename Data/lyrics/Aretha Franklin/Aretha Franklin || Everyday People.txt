
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
(Yo Gang, let’s kick the ballistics)
Let’s party big time, oh
Get up everybody, Oh whoo yeah
Uh Huh Uh Huh Uh Huh

Sometimes I'm right, I can be wrong 
My own beliefs are in my song 
A thinker, a banker, a drummer and then 
Makes no difference what group I'm in 

I am everyday people, yeah yeah 

There is a blue one (uh-huh) that don’t accept the green one (what you say)
Crackin’ on the fat one (uh-huh), like I’m about to be a skinny one (oh) 
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so 
Scooby dooby doo-yaa-doo-yaa-doo
Oh sha sha - we got to live together 

I am no better and neither are you 
We’re basically the same whatever we do 
First you love me and then you hate me, you think you know me and then 
You can't figure out if (in-audible) 

I am everyday people, yeah yeah 

There is a cone head (uh-huh) that don't accept the dome head (what you say) 
Sisters and brothers (uh-huh) let's be cool with each other (oh)
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on
Etcetera, etcetera 
Oh sha sha - we got to live together, yeah

This track is killin’ me 
Lord have mercy

Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul

There is a yellow one (yellow one) 
That ain't into the red one (red one)
We don't about the black one (black one) 
Ha, What about white one y'all? (white one)
Different lengths don’t come with no dress
And so on and so on 
Scooby dooby doo-bee-doo-yaa-doo

I am everyday people, yeah yeah 
I am everyday people, yeah yeah 

Wanna take you higher
Higher, Higher

I am everyday people, yeah yeah
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
