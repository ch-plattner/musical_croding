
Mmmm, my darling, my darling,
Oooh, darling, o-o-o-oh.

Now I know that you've been staying at home, baby,
yeah, all alone,
and I've been working day and night, baby
(just working day and night)
I know that you've been tired of hearing the same old song,
(Baby, I don't really blame ya),
for feeling all that you feel.

It seems we've got a problem,
I sweart I'll compromize,
I've been working really hard just to make it right,
so I never gonna leave you again,
I'll never leave you again.

Ooooh,
It's been a long long time since I've seen your smile,
since I felt your touch,
Oooh, I miss you so much,
I've been gone for so long,
And I know I were wrong,
So I never gonna leave you again,
I'll never gonna leave you again.

And some times I get caught up in things that I do,
And boy, I never pay attention at time,
(It passes so fast)
Although I call you on the phone,
Honey I get a thing,
Only one thing about reality,
I feel like a fool, and I do.

You could be spending time with somebody else,
But instead you're still at home,
All alone night and day,
So I'm never gonna leave you again,
I'll never leave you again.

Ooo-hooo,
sha-bi-du-day, wee-woo-bi-du-du-woop-du-du-doo
Wa-di-du-du-du-dub-di-du-du oh oh
Zip-zipn-zip-du-du-zipn-zipn-dip-yeah yeah
Wab-web-wab-web-wa-waa-waaaa

I'll promise that I'll never leave ya,
Hoping and now I'm trying,
And if you ever have a problem call my name and I'll be there,
All I want is you to let me back into your arms,
And I'm staying by your side,
Give me a chance.

It seems we've got a problem,
I sweart I'll compromize,
I've been working day and night just to make it right, baby
Never gonna leave you again,
I'll never leave you again., wo auuh,
Well, I never gonna leave you again,
I'll never leave you again, oooh ooh, yeah, eeih yah,
I'm gonna be right by your side, oh baby, yeah
I ain't going nowhere, hey yeah,
Dip-di-du-du-du-du-du....
