
Here in my book of memories
each page remembers you and me.
running in the rain, laughing in the sunshine
we used to share our kisses and dreams.

Now you´ve gone to some distant shore,
what happend to the boy next door?
Wherever you are I wonder if you´d cherish
the special joy we shared yesterday.

Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender,
dind´t we have something after all?
Do you still remember?

Come here and let me breathe you in
oh you´ve haven´t lost that same old grin.
I know what you want and I´ll confess to one thing
I´ts never been as good as it was then.

Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender,
dind´t we have something after all?

Why we fought each other?
I will never know.
But I can´t seem to shake the past.
If we had another chance to make it go
I wonder could we make it last?

Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender,
dind´t we have something after all?

Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender,
dind´t we have something after all?

Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender,
dind´t we have something after all?
