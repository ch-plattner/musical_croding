
That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...

All I want is a little bit of love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you... (Still!)
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky,
A kiss, and no goodbyes - That's all I want from you...

Don't let me down, oh, show me that you care;
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come (may not come!), when dreamers dream (may not come!) too late...

A little love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you...

Don't let me down! Show me that you care!
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come... (may not come!) Dreamers dream... (may not come!) Late...

A little love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you... (Still!)

Baby, that's all! (That's all, that's all I want from you...)
Baby! (That's all, that's all I want from you...)
(That's all, that's all I want from you...)
Ooh, baby! (That's all, that's all I want from you... slowly, slowly...)
