Says you gotta tell me something

Sure, you're in love again
You never sure he's gonna be the one
'Cause on the first night he didn't try to get the ooh-wee
Just 'cause he kissed you on the cheek and called you baby
It doesn't mean he's running no game

Oh, could you listen for a minute?
You ain't the one who's in it
Yeah, I know I'm getting twisted, I ain't hating
'Cause I been there and I've done that
I'm just watching you play

Lemme put you up on game
Every man is different but the game won't change
Lemme put you up on game
So you don't make the same mistakes I made

Lemme put you up on game
Players make the players and the players play the game
So before you go and you take his last name
Lemme put you up on, up on, up on game

Oh, I understand what you're saying
And I know you tested the waters in your days
And you been through some things
He might just be the one, [?]
There's somethin' 'bout him so different

Yeah, to know yourself a little better
I'm trying to help you, girl, for what it's worth
'Cause you done been there and done that
No, I won't go out like that, no, hey

Lemme put you up on game
Every man is different but the game won't change
Lemme put you up on game
So you don't make the same mistakes I made

Lemme put you up on game

So before you go and you take his last name
Lemme put you up on, up on, up on game

I don't wanna see him hurt you
Oh, don't worry about me, I'll be okay
I done said the same thing before
But that was way back in the day

Sometimes you think
That you know but you don't
So follow my advice, don't let it happen twice
You gotta look around

Lemme put you up on game
Every man is different but the game won't change

Listen to the voice of experience
