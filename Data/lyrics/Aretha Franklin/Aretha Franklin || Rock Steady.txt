Rock steady baby!
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is

Step n' move your hips
With a feelin' from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride

And while you're movin'
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)

It's a funky and low down feelin'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is
Is I might be doin'
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Let me hear ya gotta feelin' in the air)
Oh!
(Gotta a feelin' an ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady........ rock steady baby
Rock steady........ rock steady baby

[Instrumental]

Step and move your hips
With a feelin' from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
While you're movin' rock steady
Rock steady

Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)
It's a funky and low down feelin'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is - is I might be doin'
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oooooooooooooh
(Wave your hands up in the air
Got the feelin' an ain't got a care)
Oooooooooooooh
(What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady baby
Rock steady... woo!
Rock steady

[Instrumental]

(Rock.... steady!... rock... steady!)

(What it is)
It's a funky and low down feelin'
(What it is)
In my hips from left and right
(What it is)
What it is
Is I might be doin'
This funky dance all night

Oooooooooooooh
(Wave your hands up in the air)
Oooooooooooooh
(Got a feelin' an ain't got a care)
Oooooooooooooh
(What fun to take this ride)
Oooooooooooooh
(Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady
Steady it baby!
Rock....rock steady baby

[Fades]

Baby

Baby baby
(What it is)
Baby
(What it is)
Baby...
