
All this time
I couldn't shake your memory
And I never knew the
Sweetest love was the first

So what am I supposed
To do about this curse
Oh, baby, I've got you to blame
And I'm calling
Calling out your name

Oh, he was so fine
Jimmy Lee, oh, he was so fine
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee

(Jimmy Lee)
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
(Jimmy Lee)

Find me rushing off
To school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy, always laughing
When I'm running
Cause I knew you'd meet me
When I got there

Stealing kisses in the hall
Before the first bell
You smelled so fine
Though we'd just met
I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heartline

(Maybe he knew his stuff)
Well, just between you and me
(Maybe you weren't enough)
He was the first one

(Maybe he'd seen enough)
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always remember
History, biology
And that magical December

Ooh, boy
Jimmy Lee, where can you be
If this song ever finds you
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me behind you, yeah

(Jimmy Lee) Jimmy

On the average twice a week
I think I see you
On some avenue
Someone laughs or shakes his head
They way you used to
I guess I got myself a loose screw

I grew up and
Had my share of adventure
Well, I've had some fun
But you never need
To question my intentions
Cause each guy is just another rerun

(Maybe he knew his stuff)
Well, just between you and me
(Maybe you weren't enough)
He was the first one

(Maybe he'd seen enough)
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always remember
Hey, Lord, history, biology
And that magical December, ah hah

Jimmy Lee, where can you be
If this song ever finds you
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me behind you
Oh, yeah

(Jimmy Lee) Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy Lee (Jimmy Lee)
(Jimmy Lee)

(Maybe he knew his stuff)
Well, just between you and me
(Maybe you weren't enough)
He was the first one

(Maybe he'd seen enough)
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it, yeah

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always, always remember
History, biology
And that magical, oh, December

Jimmy Lee, where can you be
If this song ever finds you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me, oh, behind you

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me...
