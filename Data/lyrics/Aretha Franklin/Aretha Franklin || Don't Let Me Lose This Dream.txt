If I lose this dream (this dream!), I don't know what I'm gonna do...
If I lose this dream (this dream!) I'm dreaming about for me and you...

If it goes away, I might as well hang it up, 'cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind to make it true, to help it grow,
And I only know, I only know, I only know...

If I lose this dream (this dream!), it's goodbye, love and happiness, yes...
You're the one I need - I don't want a love that's second-best...

There been things all of my life I wanted to do that made me blue;
Help me hold onto this dream, for sometimes, dreams often come true,
And they'll come true, they'll come true, for me and you...

(Wait a minute, baby!)

Don't let me lose this dream!
Baby, baby, hold on!
Don't let me lose my dream!
Baby, baby, be strong!

You say that-a you believe that what I say is true (Hey, hey, hey!),
And that I'm the one and only girl for you - (Wait a minute, baby!) Just tell me...
No matter what the people say, (Hey, hey, hey!) Say that 
You're in my corner all the way, 
And I won't lose this dream... 
Baby, baby, hold on!
Don't let me lose my steam! 
Baby, baby, be strong!

Don't let me... ooh, baby;
Baby, baby, hold on!
Don't let me... oh...
