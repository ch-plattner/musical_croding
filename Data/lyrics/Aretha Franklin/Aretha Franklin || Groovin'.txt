On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Instead of groovin'

Groovin'
On a crowded avenue
Groovin'
Anything we like to do

There ain't no place I'd rather be
Imagine all the people that we'd like to see

Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon

Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
I couldn't get away too soon, baby

Oh darling, you send me
You
You
