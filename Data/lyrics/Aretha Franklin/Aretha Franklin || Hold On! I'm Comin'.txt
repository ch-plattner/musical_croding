Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

I'm on my way, your lover
If you get cold, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry, 'cause I'm here
Don't have to suffer, baby, 'cause I'm here

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

Reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name for quick reaction
Baby, baby, yeah

Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, 'cause I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

Just hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on, hold on
