
Each place I go only the lonely go
Some little small cafe
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be

The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless, hopeless game that only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere, you’ll find a love that used to care

And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be that one time
That a hopeless, a hopeless little dream like that comes true

If you find love hang on to each caress
And never let love go
Oh, you will know, you’ll know the loneliness
The heartbreak that only the lonely know
