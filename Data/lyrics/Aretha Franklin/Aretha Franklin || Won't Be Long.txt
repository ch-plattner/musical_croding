Baby, here I am
By the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
'Cause he's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long

I've been so lonesome
Since the man has been gone
There ain't a thing worth mentioning
Nothin' been going on

And that's why I know
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

My daddy told me
When he said goodbye
Yes, he did
"I'll be back, baby
Baby, by and by,"

And that's why I waited
So doggone long, yeah
Can't you see how happy I am?
Because the man is coming home

So now, here I be
By the railroad tracks
Oh, waiting for my baby
He's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
Yeah, and it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

I ain't had no loving
Since you know when
He's a long-gone rooster
And I'm a lonesome hen

And that's why I'm sure
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

Mmm, and I'm so excited
My knees are shaking, yeah
Mr. Engineer
Don't you keep me waiting!
You hear me?
Telling you:
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

Baby, here I am
Oh, by the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
He's coming back

Coming back to me
Lord, on the 503
Yeah, and it won't be long
No, it won't be long

Ahh, yeah, I know
When the whistle blows
Hey, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
I don't know about you, but
I know, yeah, I know
That it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
Said it won't be long
No, it won't be long...
