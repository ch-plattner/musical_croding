Someday, Someway You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes Darling, you're going to need me again
It's just a matter of time
Go on, go on Til you reach the end of the line
Cause I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
Remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time

Words are spoken with chords played
Someday and Someway
Girl you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes Darling, I know you gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time
