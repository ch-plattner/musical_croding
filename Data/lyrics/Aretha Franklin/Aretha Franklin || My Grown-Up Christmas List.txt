
Do you remember me? I sat upon your knee
And I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now, still need help somehow
Not for myself but for a world, a world in need

No more lives torn apart
And wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never ever, ever end
This is my grown up Christmas list
My Christmas list

As children we believe
The grandest sight we'd see
Was something pretty
Wrapped beneath the tree

And heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Could never, ever, ever heal
A human soul

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal, heal
All broken hearts

Every, everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

What is this illusion
Called the innocence of youth
Maybe in our blind belief
We can only find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
Time, time would heal
All broken hearts

Everyone would have a friend
And love would never end
And right would always win

This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list
My grown up Christmas list
I wish I found a [?]
