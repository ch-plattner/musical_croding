Woke up this mornin' to a perfect day 
I opened my window, heard a sparrow say {Tweedle dee dee dee} 
Positive thoughts are runnin' through my mind 
Nothin' is wrong, feelin' real strong 
'Cause a new day is comin' 

The sun is shining 
No clouds in view 
Lovers are holdin' hands 
The world's brand new 

Everybody's smiling 
Summer's comin' through 
But the only thing that's missing is you 
{Only thing that's missing is you} 

I-I-I-I see your smile through your photograph 
{Through your photograph} 
The thing that you said still makes me laugh {Laugh} 
Deep inside I'm on the edge of tears 
But I can't be cryin', sittin' around sighin'
Just 'cause you're not here 

The sun is shining (Sun is shining) 
No clouds in view (Ooh, yeah) 
Lovers are holdin' hands 
The world's brand new 

Everybody's smiling 
Summer's comin' through 
But the only thing that's missing is you 
{Only thing that's missing is you} 

Baby, baby, show me what do you do when love is gone 
You count your blessings and you move on {And you move on} 
{No, I ain't lonely} No, I ain't lonely, this ain't no 
sad song 
There's just one contradiction, I can't stand to be 
alone 

The sun is shining (Oh, come and get me, baby) 
No clouds in view (In view) 
Lovers are holdin' hands (Lovers are holdin' hands) 
The world's brand new (Yeah, the world's brand new) 

Everybody's smiling (Everybody's smiling) 
Summer's comin' through (Summer's comin' on through) 
But the only thing (The only thing) that's missing is 
you (The only thing, only thing, yeah) 
{Only thing that's missing is you} 

The sun is shining 
No clouds in view (In view) 
Lovers are holdin' hands (Lovers are holdin' hands) 
The world's brand new (The world's brand new) 

Everybody's smiling (Everybody's smiling) 
Summer's comin' through (Summer's comin' on through) 
But the only thing that's missin' is you 
{Only thing that's missin' is you} (Only thing that's 
missing, baby) 

But the only thing that's missing is you 
{The only thing that's missing is you}
