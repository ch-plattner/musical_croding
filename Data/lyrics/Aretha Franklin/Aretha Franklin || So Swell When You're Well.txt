
You know I love you, baby, from A to Z,
But something about you keep a-worryin' me...
Sometimes you love me, and sometimes you don't;
Sometimes you will, and then, sometimes you won't...

Oh, you're so swell, baby, when you're well;
You're so swell, baby, when you're well...
You're so swell, baby, when you're well,
Oh, but you just stay sick so long...

Keep on connivin' and your jivin' too;
True love ain't never gonna smile on you...
You pace the floor, honey, you sit and cry;
Pull out your hair, and then you wonder why...

It's 'cause you're so swell, baby, when you're well;
You're so swell, baby, when you're well...
Yeah, so swell, baby, when you're well,
Oh, but you just stay sick so long...

You build me up, and then you let me down;
Gimme little smile, but then you change it to frown...
Yeah, if you love me like you say you do,
How could you love me after you've been too?

You're so swell when you're well;
You're so swell, baby, when you're well...
Do you know that you're so swell when you're well?
Oh, but you just stay sick so long... Yeah, yeah...

Fool that I am not to put you down;
Gimme little smile, and then you change it to a frown...
Yeah, if you love me like you say you do,
Tell me, how could you love me after you've been too?

Oh, ho, ho! When you're well...
You're so swell, baby, when you're well...
Can I hear? So swell, baby, when you're well...
Oh, but you just stay sick so long... 

Do you know that you're ha, yeah... so swell, when you're well?
You're so swell! So swell, baby, when you're well,
Let me hear you now!
Oh, but you just stay sick so long...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Uh-huh... you're so swell, baby, when you're well,
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah!
Oh, but you just stay sick so... 

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! So swell, when you're well...
You're so swell, baby, when you're well...
So swell, baby.. when you're well,
Oh, but you just...
So sick, so sick, uh-huh, yeah!

Do you know, ah, hah?
But you just stay sick so... So sick, so sick! Yeah-heah, yeah-heah!
