April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools...)

In an April dream, once you came to me,
You smiled, I looked into your eyes, and I knew I'd be loving you, and,
Then you touched my hand, and I knew April dreams could come true...

Are we just April fools, who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? I don't care, true love has found us now... 
(April fool, true love's found us now...)
Whoo! Yes, it has!
(April fool, true love's found us now...)
Uh-huh...

Little did we know where the road would lead;
Here we are, a million miles away from the past, travelin' so fast, and,
There is no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last...
