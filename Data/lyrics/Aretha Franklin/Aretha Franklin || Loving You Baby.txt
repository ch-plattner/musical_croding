Brings a chill right down my spine, yes it does
You give me so much joy
Your love’s kinda hard to define
All my love is yours
Ooh, I confess, you’re so smooth, ooh, ooh
Love me all the time
Ooh, sweet baby, you’re so cool, ooh, ooh

Loving you baby
Don’t make it hard when we’re trying and making
Our love so satisfying
Love standing side by side
So much faith, so much pride
Loving you, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, baby
Loving you

Don’t leave me, oh
Don’t leave me alone in trouble
Just call my name
And you know I’ll be there on the double
Dancing on the floor
Take me out, everything’s cool, yes it is, ain’t it now?
You might be the one
Just remember, sparkles, no fool

Loving you baby
Don’t make it hard when we’re trying and making
Your love so satisfying
Love standing side by side
So much faith, so much pride
Loving you, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, baby
Loving you, oh, ooh

Doo do do doo do
Doo do doo, do do do doo, do do
Doo do, doo do
Do do doo do
Doo do doo, do do do doo, do do
Ooh ooh, ooh, yeah
Sweet baby
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh yeah

Loving you baby
Don’t make it hard when we’re trying and making
Your love so satisfying
Love standing side by side
So much faith, oh, so much pride
Loving you, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, baby
Loving you, oh, ooh

Lovin you baby  (loving you)
Loving you, ooh, ooh  (loving you)
Lovin you baby  (loving you)
Hey baby, loving you, ooh, ooh, ooh  (loving you)
Loving you  (loving you)
Ooh, ooh, loving you
