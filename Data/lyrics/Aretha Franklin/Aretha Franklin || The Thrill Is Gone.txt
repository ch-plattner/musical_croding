I have had my fun if I never get well no more.
All of my health is failing;
Lord, I'm going down slow,

I'm going down slow.
Please write my father and tell her the shape I'm in.
Please write my father and tell her the shape I'm in.
Tell him to pray for me,
Forgive me for my sin,
For all of my sin.

Early one morning, look for my clothes back home.
Early one morning, look for my clothes back home.
'Cause all of my health is failing;
Lord, I'm going down slow,
All he can do is moan.

All of my health is failing;
Lord, I'm going down slow,
I'm going down slow.

Early one morning, Im coming home and I believe that Im gonna make it there
Early one morning, Im coming home and I believe that Im gonna make it there
If he doesnt see my body
Lord, I'm going down slow,
