
If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your arms red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

And if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
Just how I'd leave in autumn, I never, never would know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

Oh would I leave you running merrily, merrily, merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow?

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in springtime
Knowing how in springtime I'm bewitched, bewitched, bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
If ever I would leave, leave you at all
