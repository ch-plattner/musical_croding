
My soul can't last, my soul can't last

Once in a while I will dream dear
Knowin' dreams will seldom come true
Yes, but once in a while I will dream dear
And I hope you'll be thinkin' of me too

Yes, I must confess that I will miss you
Like the stars would miss the sky
Like a whale would miss its water
If it should ever happen to run dry

Although I cried when you left me
Yes, I cried for a year and a day
You know my soul can't last, my soul just can't last
Please answer me right away

You know that my soul just can't last
My, my, my, my, my soul just can't last
Soul just can't last, please answer me, please answer me
I said that my soul just can't last
