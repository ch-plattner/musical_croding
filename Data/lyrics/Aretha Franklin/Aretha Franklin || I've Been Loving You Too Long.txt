
I've been loving you too long to stop now

You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
Oh, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you oh, too long
I don't want to stop now, oh, oh, oh

I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh, oh, oh
And don't make me stop now
Oh baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now

I love you, I love you, I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please don't make me stop now
Talkin' 'bout heart and soul
That I love you
I love you
