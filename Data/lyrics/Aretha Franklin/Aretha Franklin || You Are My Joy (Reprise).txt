
This is love, my darling
Can't you feel it?
When you really had me, concealing
I just can't be that way with you

The light of my life
And you don't even know it
How many ways can I show it
Wherever you are
I wanna be with you, baby

The joining of our hearts
The joining of our heads
With this ring, I thee wed
The love of my life
I trust you with my heart, dear
I trust you more when you're not here

This is your last chance
There'll be no backward glance
Are we on or are we through? [Repeat]

You feel it in your heart
You feel it down in your soul, baby
Oh, yeah
