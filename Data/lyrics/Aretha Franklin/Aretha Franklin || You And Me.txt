
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity;
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity...

We've got each other's love and understanding,
And that's what it takes to make love grow...
We've got our strength, and our love for all mankind,
But most of all, we've got peace of mind...

I know people are gonna try and knock us down,
But we're gonna be strong, ain't gon' let nobody turn us around!

(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity, yeah, now;
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity...

You know temptation, it works on us too,
But we're too strong to let it get us down...
I've got your love, baby, and you've got mine,
And the Lord knows we're gonna be together 'til the end of time, hey, hey...

I know people are gonna try to knock us down,
But we're gonna be strong, ain't gon' let nobody turn us around, oh!

(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity;
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity...

(You and me will always be joined together for eternity;
You and me will always be joined together for eternity...)
