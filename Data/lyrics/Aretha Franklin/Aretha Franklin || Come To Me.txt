You're asking me to
Understand your feelings
To just forget about my own
And let you go

Darling, I won't
Raise a hand to stop you
Just let me say one thing
Before you go

Come to me
Whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me

I believe that time alone
Will change you
The changing tides
Will bring you back to me

And when you grow tired
Of chasing rainbows
Just make a wish for love
And there I'll be

Come to me
Whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me

Ooh, come to me
Whenever you get lonely
(Come to me, baby)
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me, sweet baby

Come to me
Whenever you get lonely

Log on to kill this message.

(Oh, yeah, come to me, baby)
Just reach out your hand
(Reach out, reach out)
And there I'll be

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me

(If you ever get lonely)
Come to me
Whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
(Reach out for me)
(Sweet baby, I'll be there)

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me, yeah
