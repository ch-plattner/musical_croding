
I say I'll move the mountains, and I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way...
Crazy, he calls me... sure, I'm crazy;
Crazy in love, I'd say...

I say I'll go through fire, yes, and I will kill fire;
As he wants it, so it shall be...
Crazy, he calls me... sure, I'm crazy;
Crazy in love, you see...

Like the wind that shakes the bough,
He moves me with a smile...
The very difficult, I will do right now;
The impossible will take a little while...

And I say I'll care forever, and I really will care forever,
Even if I, even if I, even if I have to hold up the sky...
Crazy, he calls me... well, maybe, baby, maybe, I'm crazy;
Sure, crazy in love am I...
Crazy in love am I...
And I will move the mountains...
