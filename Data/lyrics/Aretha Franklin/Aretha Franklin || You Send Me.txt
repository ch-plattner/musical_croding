Darling you send me. I know you send me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do
You thrill me, I know you thrill me
Darling you thrill me
Honest you do 
Honest you do
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But it lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting 
to marry you and take you home

You Send Me
You Send Me
You Send Me
Honest you do

Whenever I'm with you
Whenever I'm near you
Honest you do
I know when you hold me, 
whenever you kiss me
