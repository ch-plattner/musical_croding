I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Baby In the heart of my heart I want more
Of the man who just walked through that door
The only one that my eyes see

Baby the moments have drifted away
And the hours became lonely days
You're the answer to what I have prayed
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Baby, losing you's all that I fear
And I'm losing it when you're not here
I never could go on without you

Baby, I feel like a shower of light
And I need you right here by my side
I'm craving you all of my life

I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Aah you move me
Baby
Aah you move me

I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about
Your love
