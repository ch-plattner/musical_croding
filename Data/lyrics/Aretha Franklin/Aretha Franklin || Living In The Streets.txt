People workin' night and day
You need to take some time out to get away
Life is just a one way ride
There ain't no second chance that you can try

Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

Yeah, I know you sure feelin' low
It's time to get on up and steal the show
Leave your worries all behind
You've got to make your smile the bottom line

Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

Do just what you want to do, you know that you can try
Get the groove and take it to the sky, here on dancin' night

Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

Do just what you want to do, let no one pull you down
Join the party, people let it last, all night to party

Spread the feelin' through the land
We've got to share this action while we can
No more talkin', no more chat
We're gonna make this evenin' come alive

Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight
Livin' in the streets tonight, livin' in the streets tonight

Livin' in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together
Livin' in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together

Livin' in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together
Livin' in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together

Livin' in the streets tonight
Come on, out we'll smoke this town together
