Say I bet you never thought you'd find
A sweet lover
You'd never find a girl like me
I say
I bet you never thought you'd find
A sweet lover
You'd never find a girl like me

Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet lover, yeah

Ah, no matter how I treat you, baby
You like it
And I know, because you told me so
I said no matter how I treat you, baby
You like it
And I know it, 'cause you told me so

Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet, sweet lover, yeah

Oh yeah!
I've got my hooks in you
Uh huh
Hmm, but I guess you've got me, too

'Cause I never ever thought I'd find
A sweet, sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you
I say I never, never ever thought I'd find
A sweet sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you

Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Mmm, sweet lover, yeah

Oh yeah!
I've got my hooks in you
Uh huh
Mmm, but I guess you've got me, too

Oh, oh, I never
Never ever thought I'd find
A sweet lover
Never find a man like you
I said I never, never thought I'd find
A sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you

Oh, oh
Mmm, oh yeah
Sweet, sweet lover, yeah

Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet lover, yeah

Oh, oh
Ow, oh yeah!
Sweet lover
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
