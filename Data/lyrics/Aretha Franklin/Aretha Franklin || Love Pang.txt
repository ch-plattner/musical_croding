Oh baby
I feel your perfect love
Whenever my day begins
While brushing my teeth
Combing my hair
I feel you deep within
Ooohh I feel your touch, your touch
While eating my morning meal
While washing the dishes
Making up the bed
Last night was one of those things

I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories of last night
Something moves all through my body baby
Making every little thing all right

Got good loving, such good loving
Memories of last night
Something moves all through my body baby
Making every little thing all right

I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories, memories of days gone by
Something moves all through my body baby
Making every little thing all right

I feel, I feel the sun 
While listening, listening to my favorite song
While I'm going to my job
Driving in my car
I want your take your good loving

I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories of days gone by
Something moves all through my body baby
Making every little thing all right
