Oh, when you're... yes, yes, when you're...
When you're young - yeah, thank you, Jesus! - gifted and black!
Open your heart, is all I need...

There's a millions of boys and girls 
Who are young, gifted and black,
With their souls intact - and that's a fact!

"There's a world waiting for you - Yours is the quest that's just begun..."

When you feelin' real low, 
Here's a great truth that you should remember and know:
That you're young, gifted, and black!
You got your soul intact - oh, and that's a fact!

You're young and you're black, you got your soul intact,
You got the future, don't you know it's a fact?
(Young, gifted, and black...)
