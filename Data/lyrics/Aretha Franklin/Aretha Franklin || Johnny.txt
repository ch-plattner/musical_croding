
When I think of Johnny
I remember the spring
I remember his laughter
And the way he would sing

Oh, how I loved Johnny
With my heart I loved Johnny
Oh, how I loved Johnny
But he never knew

I prayed that he’d travel
Through the winter’s wild storm
And he’d kiss me and hold me
So close and so warm

Oh, how I loved Johnny
With my heart I loved Johnny
Oh, how I loved Johnny
But he never knew

He left with leaves falling
Falling dead to the ground
And no more will I ever
Hear his sweet laugh, laughing sound

Oh, how I loved Johnny
Oh, how I loved Johnny
Oh, how I loved Johnny
But he never, ever knew
He never knew
Never knew
Never
