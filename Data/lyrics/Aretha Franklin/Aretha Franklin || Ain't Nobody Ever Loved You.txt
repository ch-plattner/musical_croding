I've seen you hangin? out
Lookin? like you know what life's about
Laughin?, jivin? with your friends
Baby, that ain't where the world ends, oh yeah

I'm layin? my love on you
You'll be feelin? somethin? brand new, oh yes, you will
Gonna hold you tight with all my might
Squeeze you right, whatcha wanna do tonight? Yeah

I'm gonna hold you in the afternoon
Tease you from the sun
Dancin' 'neath the island moon
We'll go on and on, yeah

Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, oh, baby, no
Ain't nobody ever loved you, boy
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

Hey, drag a comb across your hair
Change your shirt, we're going somewhere, ain't we, baby?
I'll throw a little lipstick on
Check the mirror twice and we're gone

I believe in rain
We can bring the heat up again, oh, yes, we can
I'm gonna take my time and treat you fine
Baby, baby, baby, I'm makin' you mine, oh tonight, boy

Hear the people laugh and sing
Right outside your door
Somethin? great is happenin?
And you can be sure

Ain't nobody else could love you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody love you, no
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey
Ain't nobody love you, no
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey

Hear the people laugh and sing, hey hey
Right outside your door, hey man
Somethin? great is happenin?
And you can be sure

Nobody else can love you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody love you, no
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey
Ain't nobody love you, no
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey

Ain't nobody love you, no
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey
Ain't nobody love you, no
