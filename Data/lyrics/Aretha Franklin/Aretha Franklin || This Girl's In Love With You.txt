
You see this girl, this girl's in love with you
Yes I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell it know each other very well

How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you 'cause
I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know

My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy, if not I'll just die

Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy, if not I'll just die
