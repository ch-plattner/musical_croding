
The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Happy with my someone new
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

My darling, can't we make up?
Ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love

I am still in love with you
