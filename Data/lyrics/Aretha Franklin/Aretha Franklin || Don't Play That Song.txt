‘Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no! Don’t let them play it (oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (it hurts!)
Please stop it right away
‘Cause I remember just a’ what he said

He said, darling (darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
You lied (to me)

Hey mister, don’t play it no more
Don’t play it no more
I can’t stand it
Don’t play it no more (no more)
No more (no more)
No more (can’t stand it)

I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he’d be so mean

He told me darling (darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (darling, I need you)
You, you lied (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
Lied, lied (to me)

O-o-oh darling (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (darling, I need you)
You know I know you lied (darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (you lied)
You lied (you lied)
You lied. You’re all that I need. You lied  (to me)
O-u-o-o-o-oh, you lied (don’t play it no more)
Hey baby don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, don’t play it no more)
Don’t do it. Don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, for me)
No more (for me)
I can’t stand it no more (don’t play it no more)
Ouh! Hey! Don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, don’t play it no more)
