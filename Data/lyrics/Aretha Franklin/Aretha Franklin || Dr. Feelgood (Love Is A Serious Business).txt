
I don't won't nobody always 
sitt'in around me and my man.
I don't won't nobody always 
sitt'in right there looking at me and that man.
Be it my mother my bother or my sister
Would you believe I get up put on some clothes, 
go out and help them find somebody for their selves if I can, 
yes I will.

Now I don't mind company. 
Because company's alright with me every once in a while. Yes it is.
I say I don't mind company. 
Because company's alright with me every once in a while. Yeah.
But Oooooooooooh! 
When me and that man get to luv'in. 
I tell you girls, I dig you, but I just don't have time.
To sit and sit and sit and sit tight and smile.

Don't send me no doctor.
Filling me up with all of those pills.
I got me a man name Dr. Feelgood.
Oh! Yeah! That man takes care of all of my pains and my ills.
His name is Dr. Feelgood in the morning.
And taking care of business 
is really this man's game.

And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood.
You'd understand why Feelgood is his name.
Oh! Yeah! Ooh! 
Good God Almighty the man show makes me feel real good.
