Gonna have to pack up my things I’m gonna walk
You say a dollar goes from hand to hand
But before I see you go from woman to woman
I’d rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log, yes I would

I love you baby but you just won’t be fair
I don’t believe you know how to be on the square
Now go on and have your fun and if you must
But before I have another man that I cannot trust
I’d rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log, yeah

You promised me you were gonna live by the golden rule
I work all day and walk just like a fool
For you my kisses are sweet as they can be
But before I see you make a stone fool out of me
I’d rather drink muddy water
Yes I’d rather drink muddy water
I’d rather drink muddy water
Oh yes I would

I’d rather drink muddy water
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes I would
Show me the way, way, way, way, way down
To that place I can find that muddy water
I’ll go ahead and turn it on up
I say I’d rather drink muddy water
I’d rather drink muddy, muddy, muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log
