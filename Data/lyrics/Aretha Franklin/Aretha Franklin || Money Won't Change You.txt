Told my darling that I had to go
It's your body, I don't care no more
Although you had me, time to get along
Money won't change you

I momey won't change you...
But time will take your own do


Then you know how to be treated just like dirt
Hold me, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman, my only girl

Money won't change you, money won't change you...
But time will take your own do

I know you're happy now that you're gone
Money won't change you
I said money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you own

I said, put a smile as good as gold
But that smile now can't be sold
You said, baby, that you had to go
Back to somebody, I don't care no more
Told your friends I was a fool
The trouble's, woman, that you've got to go through
Other lover won't take me home
I have a...
Even in the street, even in the car too
Mashed potatoes and boogaloo
C'mon baby and let yourself go...
It's your body, I don't care no more
C'mon baby, c'mon baby, everybody, everybody
Need your hand, need your hand
Let me tell you I, I, I...
I'm down so long...
