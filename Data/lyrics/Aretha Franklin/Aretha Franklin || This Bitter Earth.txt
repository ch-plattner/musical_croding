
This bitter earth
What fluted passed
What good is love
That no one wants to share
And if my life is like the dust
That haunts the rose
Tell me what good am I
Heaven only knows
Well I found it can be so cold
Today oh 
And before you know it
Too soon you've grown old
But while a voice within me cries
Someone may answer my call
And this bitter earth
May not be so bitter after all
