
It's an ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall
Well it don't bother me at all 
It's an ever changing time

And me, ever changing time 
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life, and everything I do 
Wonder if the dreams that I believed in
Still come true 

Caught in between, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting what's mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives 

And I, I had some big idea 
So much of my life, still not completed 
Hopes and Fears 
Watching it change, into something new 
Wondering it I'm gonna find the answer, loving you 

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives 

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting what's mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together 
And we're gonna be alright, together, all of our lives 

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time
