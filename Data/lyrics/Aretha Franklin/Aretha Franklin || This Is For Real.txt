If I wanted to, I'd have anything
I could ever need, anything indeed
But if I can't have you I'd be lost within
And everything else baby
Would really not be worth anythin'

And I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playin' this time
This is for real, real

And if I could, I'd change what I am
But without you baby, I don't give a damn
'Coz what I am won't change until you change it
To anythin' you want it to be

Oh, I'm putting my trust in you
And I really got to tell it
Exactly how I feel
Make you understand that
Love ain't playin' this time
This is for real

I thought it out the other day
And came to the conclusion
That I wouldn't last a minute
Without your love, baby
No, no, no, no, no, no

You really did show me, baby
When you walked out on me
Now I've got to make you understand
That I won't be bad, I won't be bad anymore

Oh, honey, this is for real
Everythin' that I'm sayin'
Every word that I'm sayin'
Is the thought of a brand new woman

I've got to have you back
So that I can make you see
That I'm not foolin' around, baby
This is a brand [?]
And I really got to tell it
T E L L L L L L L, yeah

And make you understand
That Miss Ree ain't playin' this time
Ooh, baby this is for real

Yeah, you've got to understand me
That love ain't playin' this time
Really, this is for real, sure for real
You gotta understand me

This is, now, this is, hit it now
For real
