
You've been running around
This I know, yeah
I ought to pack my things
And let you go

But baby
I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa, no, I can't
See myself leaving you

You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes, you have

If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa, oh, my love

I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself 
Going away to stay
Oh no, I can't
See myself leaving you, no

True love 
Is so hard to find
Tell me, tell me
That I've got mine

If I go
Searching for another
I'd just be wasting
My time, yeah, hey

I say we're through
Because I love you
Yes, I do
If I leave you, baby
What would I do?

Whoa, oh, oh, my love
I wouldn't know what to do
Cause I can't see 
Myself leaving you

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I can't see myself
Leaving you, no

I can't see myself
Leaving you

Whoa, no
I can't see myself...
