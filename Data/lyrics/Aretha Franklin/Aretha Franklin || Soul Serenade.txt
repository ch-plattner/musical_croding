
Only you can hear my soul serenade...

I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world
About my soul... serenade! 
My soul serenade...

When you're not around, there's a lonely sound
In my soul serenade... 
In my soul serenade...

Everyone but you adores me,
But oh, do you know pretty soon they bore me?
Let me tell you right now that they bore me!
They bore me with their pretty little words,
Those pretty little words of devotion...
But, oh, let me tell you right now, my message to 'em this evening
Is they can jump in anybody's ocean!
Because only you hear my soul... my soul serenade!
My soul serenade...
Oh, my soul serenade.... 
My soul serenade...
