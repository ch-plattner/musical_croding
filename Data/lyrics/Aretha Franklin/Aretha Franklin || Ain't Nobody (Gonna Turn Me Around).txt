
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around no more
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around

Well I've learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Ain't nobody gonna talk sweet talk to me
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how sweet your love can be
I'm gonna take my love and put in on the shelf
Ain't gonna give it to nobody else
Ain't nobody who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Love you've been so doggone mean
You shattered every one of my dreams
You know I can't love nobody else
But still you left me here all by myself

You turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around
I learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Love, you've been so doggone mean
Love, you shattered every one of my dreams
You turned me around, turn around
You turned me around, turn around
