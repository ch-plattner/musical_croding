
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
I said nobody knows the way I feel this morning
If I had my way
The graveyard would be the place my man would lay
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Well I pawned everything I had 
Everything I had this morning
Well I pawned everything I had 
Everything I had this morning
I apwned my ring, my godl watch and chain
I'm not proud of myself
I got a little bit of shame
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Well I feel  like screaming
Screaming and crying this morining
Well I feel  like screaming
Screaming and crying this morining
And i'm a leaving here on the southbound train this morning
And i'm a leaving here on the southbound train this morning
And i'm a leaving here on the southbound train
And let me tell you that nothing is ever gonna bring your sweet baby back again
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
