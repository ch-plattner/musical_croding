Here we go with the trick questions
They bring up to break down confidence
Always throw out a sly comment
Like is your man faithful 
What time does he get home?

Don't worry I ain't gonna need your help
I'm gonna watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Skip the drama, use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck

See I don't even sweat it
I get so much happiness 
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullsh**!
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Think no evil when somebody comes home
Hear no evil, I don't want to know
See no evil, I just wanna see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool [Repeat]
