
Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right, yeah

We got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit till we get
To the other side

With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' on
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about slowin', slowin' down, yeah

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go
Come on now, go

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

Here we go, one more time

With the wind and your fingers in my hand
Kind of think we are going for an extended throw down
So drop the top, baby, and let's cruise on into
This better than ever street

City traffic movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go
Come on baby, go, do it for me now

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against my back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against my back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

And what I want you to do, baby
Get over in the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh, yeah
Take the love exit, and then make a right turn
Go on over to love and satisfaction and joy
Well, ain't we ridin' baby
Ain't we cruisin' down?
Free, free, free, freeway
Go on out to, ow
Let's be good to each other, scream
Freeway! Well
See that little landmark over there
A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff
We'll be just about ow, ow, ow!
And satisfaction roll down
Satisfaction, yeah!
