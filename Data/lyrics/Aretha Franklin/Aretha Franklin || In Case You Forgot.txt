
Something is wrong, baby 
Is the feelin' gone, baby 
Maybe I need to refresh your mind 
Think about the love we shared 
Think back to the time we cared 
Maybe you can find a reason to be here 

Oh...I'm the one who loved you, mmm 
I'm the one who made it right 
I'm the one who was there for you 
On those cold and lonely nights 

I'm the one who held you 
When the world came down on you 
And I'm the one who's in love with you 
And whose love never stops 

In case you forgot 
I give love (Ooh) and my love is so good 
In case you forgot 
I was there when you fell 'cause I care 

In case you forgot 
I left you satisfied all those nights 
In case you forgot 
I give love and my love never stops (Oh...oh...) 

Where did mine go (Where did it go) 
I never shoulda really let you know 
You're about to make a big mistake 
Now where do you think you find a love at all like mine 
Maybe all you're gonna find is heartache 

Whoa...I'm the one who loved you 
And I'm the one who made it right 
I'm the one who was there for you 
On those cold, cold and lonely nights 

I'm the one who held you 
When the world came down on you 
And I am the one who was there for you 
And whose love never stops 

In case you forgot 
I give love (Ooh) and my love is so good 
In case you forgot 
I was there when you fell 'cause I care 

In case you forgot 
I left you satisfied all those nights 
In case you forgot 
I give love and my love never stops 

Where will you go to find someone to love you like I do 
You can play anything, baby, 'cause you know that it's true 
Sometimes a love like mine comes just once in your life 
So you better, better take it, baby, and hold on tight 

In case you forgot 
I give love and my love is so good 
In case you forgot 
I was there when (You know it's true) you fell 
'cause I care (I was there for you) 

In case you forgot 
I left you satisfied all those nights 
In case you forgot 
I give love and my love never stops 

In case you forgot 
In case you forgot 
Remember me, hey, remember me, baby, baby 
In case you forgot 
I was there (I was there) when you fell 'cause I care (Oh...) 

In case you forgot 
I left you (I left you) satisfied all those nights 
In case you forgot
