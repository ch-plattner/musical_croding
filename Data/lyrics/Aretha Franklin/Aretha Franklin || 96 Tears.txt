Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on, yest it is (I just can’t stand it)
You’re way on top now, baby, since you left me, yeah
And you’re always laughin’ down at me, yes sir

But, o-o-o-oh, watch out baby, I’m gonna get there, yeah
And we’ll be together in just a little while, yes we will
And we’ll be gathering tears from way up here, oh yeah
I wanna see you cry, yeah, 96 tears, yes I do (96, it just won’t do)

I’ll be on top, and you’ll be there just lookin’ up
I can always get up here, and I might not be waving down
Cry baby, cry baby
96 tears (96)
96 tears (96)
96 tears, Lord it just won’t do (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

Ooh, try to get a hundred baby (96, it just won’t do)
96 teardrops from you (96, it just won’t do)
Oh oh, can you get a hundred, baby? yeah (can you make your tears one hundred?)
96 teardrops from you, ooo, ah, ooo, ah, ooo (can you get a million, baby?)
Get a million, yeah, yeah (96, it just won’t do)
Can you get a million tears together? (can you make your tears one hundred?)
From 96 tears, oh baby (can you get a million, baby?)
‘Cause baby there ain’t just won’t do (96, it just won’t do)
Ooo, just won’t, ooo, do, baby (can you make your tears one hundred?)
