This is my life and it's my right to live
The way I want to live each day
That's what I wanna say
And this is my song

And for too long I sang someone else's melody
It wasn't really me
Somehow I took myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

You were the sun, I was the one who just
Revolved around you day and night
You were my only life but if I were free
Baby, I'd take control of everything inside of me

Find who I wanna be
I'd never take myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me in someone else's eyes

I gotta show myself I can still exist without a man
Gotta finally take control, gotta see myself as whole with you
Though you're not the one to blame, I was lost inside your name
And I'll never be the same till I find a way back home again
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
When I, I can't, I and I will not, you can't make me
Ooh, someone else's eyes, ooh, baby, baby, baby

Till I find a way back home again
Through someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was, hey, caught me by surprise
Seein' a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love you through someone else's eyes, ooh

Someone else's eyes, no baby, ooh
Someone else's eyes, can't do it, I can't do it
I, I love you, sweet baby, I wanna be with you, baby
Through someones else's eyes, ooh

Someone else's eyes, oh, baby
Oh yeah, someone else's eyes
I wanna be by your side
God haven't you heard this lady's cry?
