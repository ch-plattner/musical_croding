Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows fall?
Why should my heart be lonely?
And long for heaven and home

When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is He
His eye is on a spar-a sparrow
And I know He watches, He watching me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on a spar-a sparrow
And I know, and I know

Do you know? Do you know?
If you get lonely, do you know?
He watch, He watch you

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm, I am free
I'm telling you God's eye
His eye is on a sparrow
And I know He will watch
He will watch me
