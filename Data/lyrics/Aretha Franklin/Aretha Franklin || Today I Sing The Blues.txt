
Without a word of warnin'
The blues walked in this mornin'
And circled around my lonely room.

I didn't know why I had that sad 'n lonely feelin'
Until my baby called and said we were through, hooo.

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But today... I'm singing the blues.

Now, I know the explanation
But to me that's no consolation
No, no, it just goes to show you
No matter how you love, everybody has got to lose
And since I've lost, I'd rather walk around and woe
I guess I just walk the darkest avenue

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But today... I'm singing the blues.

Now, it strikes me kinda funny how love can be this way
'Cause we were lovin' 'til last night honey, yeah.
I'm alone again today

And it strikes me kinda funny how fate can be so unfair
'Cos I seem to come right on the losin' end in every, every love affair!

Yes it must be, it must be meant for me that I should be the one,
Be the one to always lose, hooo.

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But right now... I'm singing the blues.
