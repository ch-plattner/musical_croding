
Say, can't I hear you say somethin'

Deep inside, fall on the wall
That's where I find protection from the rain
Since you've been gone, my only friend is yesterday, ooh boy

Telephone won't make a sound
Waitin' here for you to change your mind
You never called, I'm lost in the tears I hide behind, ohh yeah

That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me, ohh
That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me

Late at night I toss and turn
Burnin' memories lingerin' on
I'd give the world just to prove my love for you is strong

All you left is confusion and doubt
Unanswered questions, just where did I fail?
I'm hurt and helpless inside a cold and empty shell, ooh boy

That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me, yeah
That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me

You?re love's sweet reason for livin'
In your arms I found my home
Love's waitin' here for givin'
Like a stone, like a stone, oh

Telephone won't make a sound
Waitin' here for you to change your mind
But you never called and I'm lost in the tears I hide, yeah, behind

That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me
That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me, yeah

That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me, yeah
That's where I'll be
Until you say you say, say, say, say you love me

Till you say you love me
Till you say you love me
Till you say you love me
Till you say you love me

Till you say you love me
Till you say you love me
Till you say you love me
