All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered. 
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters. 
I made my mind up 
I can make it 
I'll be fine 
Even if I gotta fake it. 
I'll keep surviving. 

Another night - without you. 
Another night - I know I can get through. 
Another night - it's only  
another night - I won't be lonely. 
Another night - another night  
Another night - it ain't much 
Another night - without your touch. 

I used to search through the crowd to find you 

But I don't feel like it now 
So don't look behind you. 
You better face it 
I won't be calling 

I hit my stride when the evening is falling 

I'm gonna make it  

Another night - without you...

Out where the music is loud and the people are laughing 

I'm gonna step on out 
I won't be down 

Gonna stand my ground for just another night  
Oh yes for a another night. 

I made my mind up 
I can make it 

I'll be fine 
Even if I gotta fake it. 
I'll keep surviving 
Yes 
I will. 

Another night - without you. 
Another night - I know I can get through. 
Another night - it ain't much 
I don't need you to be bringing me down
