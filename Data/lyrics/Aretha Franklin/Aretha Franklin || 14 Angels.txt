When at night I go to sleep
14 angels watch do keep
Two my head are guarding
Two my feet are guiding

Two to whom 'tis given
To guide my steps
To heaven
To guide me

When at dawn my eyes do wake
14 angels my peace do take
Two there are who need me
Two there are who feed me

Two who sway before me show me
All I've known
Is wrong, that I am
Not me

Two there are to take my soul
Away from here
To guide my steps
