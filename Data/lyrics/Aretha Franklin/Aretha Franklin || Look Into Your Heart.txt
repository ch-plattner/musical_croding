
This one's for you Curtis
I love you
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo ooh

If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory 
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind

Ooh, everybody's got a story (history)
About love and the good things
But all the spices of your life
You gotta pay the price
If you know what I mean

I'm telling everybody I know
How a girl becomes some pride
When I finally found there was nothing left
I said I do believe I found myself 
When I found there was nothing left

I wanna give it to you baby

If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory 
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind

I know a man if he really loves me
We don't have that everyday no no no no
I know my man really needs me I say it
Whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you
Baby hey yeah, yeah yeah
Doo doo doo doo

Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you
baby I'm loving you more
And more and more
And giving you all and all
I said mercy baby
I'm loving you more and more and more
I'm giving you all and all
Say mercy baby
I'm loving you more
Mercy baby, mercy baby
Mercy baby
