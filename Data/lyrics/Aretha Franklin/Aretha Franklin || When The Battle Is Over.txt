
One more time you hurt me
You thought you you had your victory
One more reason For you to worry
Cause you got the best of me
You should never count your chickens
Before you eggs get hatched
I believe it, mm,  To my soul
You finally met your match

Tell me now
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown

Who it will be
Who it will be

Will it be you
Will it be me

Tell me now – Who will wear the crown yeah yeah
Ever time I kiss ya
I feel I get the upper hand
I want you ooo to surrender
And tell me ya gon' be my man
A slip of the lip has been known to sink a ship
And I believe I believe I believe to my soul
I finally got a winner's slip

When this battle is over, I wonder
Who will wear the crown

When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown

Who it will be
Who it will be

Will it be you
Will it be me

Yeah, Tell me know – Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who be wearin'  this crown
When this battle is over
Oh when its over children
When this battle is over
Yeaaah when its over
