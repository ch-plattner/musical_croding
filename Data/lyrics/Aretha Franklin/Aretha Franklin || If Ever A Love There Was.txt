
I saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane

And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met, when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say

I caught my breath, I fell out of touch with time
'Cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew

I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Oh, but we've come so far, we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind

Love is a memory, like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Oh, and I still believe, and I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

And I still believe, I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was
It was yours and mine
That was the the time
