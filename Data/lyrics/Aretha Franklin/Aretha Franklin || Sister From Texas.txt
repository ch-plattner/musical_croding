
The sister from Texas who's been many places, that's who I am;
Don't get yourself uptight just trying to please me - I'm down with the flame...
Here for the moment... gone forever...
Here for the moment... gone forever...
Here for the moment... gone forever, said the sister from Texas...

Hard luck nights just like I see - I don't try to color it over with rose;
Do you know that pride can kill ya? I don't try to spike my pains with my nose...
People are - here for the moment... gone forever...
Here for the moment... then we're gone forever...
Here for the moment... gone forever, said the sister from Texas...

I've seen 'em come and go, for as long as I been here;
Yeah! There just ain't very much more now, that can make me cry... Yeah, yeah!
Woman was born to love and to lose man, and vice versa;
There's one more thing I gotta get up to, and that's the real - that I was born to die,
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey!

But I'm in there fighting everyday because I got a few more dreams in me... yes, I have!
And I wonder will the day come when every man with a heartbeat will knows that he's free?
Yeah, people are - here for the moment... then they're gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever... 
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) then they're gone forever, said the sister from Texas...

Yeah! Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever, said the sister from Texas...

Yeah!
Here for the moment... gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...)gone forever, said the sister from Texas...

Here for the moment... gone forever...
(Forever...) Here for the moment... (Forever...) gone forever, baby...
(Forever...) Here for the moment...  (Forever...)gone forever, said the sister from Texas...
