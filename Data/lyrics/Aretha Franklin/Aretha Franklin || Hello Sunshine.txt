Hello sunshine
(Hello)
So glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

I can't explain what I've been through
(No, no)
Trying to live my life without you
People say I act so strange
(Oh, yeah)
But you got the power to make me change

Hello sunshine
(Hello)
I'm so glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Lonely)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(My heart)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing

Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
(Without you)

Now I know everything is alright
(You know)
No more pain, no more sleepless nights
(Oh yeah)
My days were dark but now I see
(Oh yeah)
Because my sunshine has come home to me.

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Oh yeah)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(Oh yeah)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
(Oh yeah)
They don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing)
The wonders of spring
(Don't mean a thing)

Without you, baby
(Don't mean a thing)
Without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
