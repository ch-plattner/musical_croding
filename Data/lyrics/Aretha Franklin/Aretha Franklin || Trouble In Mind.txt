Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

I'm going down to the river
I'm going top take me a rocking chair
And if the blues don't leave me, I rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before

I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
