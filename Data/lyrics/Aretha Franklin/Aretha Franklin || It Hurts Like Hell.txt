Ohhhhh
Oh baby
Ohhhhh
Oh babe

Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know you've given all you can)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(You do your best but it's still much too bad)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
True love
It has no hiding place
It's not something you just put away
It's always there inside of you
Ohhh, and it shows in everything you do
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know you've given it your best)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(You feel a thousand miles from happiness)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
Here we are, the two of us
So full of love, so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
Ooohhh, but too afraid to take the step
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know what it can put you through)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(There's nothing funny if it's killing you)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels
I know if there is any chance
For us to find our happiness
We've got to learn to let it go
Ohhh oh, forget all the pain we knew
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
Sometimes it hurts it hurts to even laugh
And it hurts like hell
That's the way
Oh baby
That's the way it feels
