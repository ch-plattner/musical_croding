I need someone, hey baby, let me love you
Please don’t push me away
Let me in your life

I wasn’t there when she hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life

I want to share your tomorrow
So I must beg, beg you for today
And if she’s the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that she’s gone away

I need someone let me love you
Please don’t push me away
Baby, let me in your life

I wasn’t there when she hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life, yeah

Cause I, I want to share your tomorrow
And so, and so I must beg, beg you for today
And if she’s the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that she’s gone away, yeah

Let me in your life, come on baby
Let me in your life, na na na, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby
