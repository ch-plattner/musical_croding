We heard the good news

We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm here to tell you about the good news
There's something about the path that we choose

Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
You'll get an answer, and there ain't no doubt

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better
And Sunday, we heard the good news

He won't stop blessing you
Look here, what He'll do
Is keep testing you
And a beggar's no less than you
'Cause one day it could be you

So get your folks together for some church
Some good music, prayer, and service won't hurt
Even if you don't like the preacher
There's bound to be a thing or two he can teach you

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news

Deceit is in the heart of them who imagine evil 
Righteousness is the fruit of the tree of all people
And if you want to live your life upright
Pray that the Lord will hold up the light

What you need is love on your side
The power of love won't be denied  
I feel comfortable giving you this advice
Don't make the same mistake twice

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better 
And Sunday, we heard the good news [Repeat]

These are the greatest days of our test of time
We need to be walking with a made-up mind
Walk by faith, not by sight
Then all your battles, you know He will fight 

If the sky changes colors there's so many ways
This world's gonna be a better place some day 
If love and unity, you just believe
Then all your blessings I know you'll receive

Glory to God in the Highest 
Glory, Glory, Glory
Jesus, man who walked on water
Jesus, He's alright, He's alright

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better
And Sunday, we heard the good news [Repeat]
