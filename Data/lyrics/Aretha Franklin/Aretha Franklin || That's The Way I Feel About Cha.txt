You got to put up with the toils and strife
Ooh, well just pushed our love a little bit too far
We forgot to remember how blessed we were, now

And the girl over there tellin' me what she sees
You don't have to worry, baby
She ain't gonna get next to me
Yes, she don't mean a thing at all
And I thought it over, yes I did

That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby, yeah

I know you've been hurt just like many others too
But that's the sacrifice that life is gonna put us all through
Trust in me, I'll trust in you and have no fear
Sometimes, I look at you, baby and wonder if God sent you here
And I thought it over, yes I did, well, well, well, well

That's the way thatI feel about you, baby
And I hope you don't mind if I get weak and cry for you sometimes
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, yeah

Please, please, please, babe, if you hear my love knocking at your door
Open up, oh, because the world ain't givin' up, sometime you're no more
I know you've been hurt, so have many others too
All we gotta do is look back over the years, shinin' through
Shine through the light and put us all through, yeah, yeah

That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you in my heart for you baby
Yeah, yeah, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
That's the way I feel about you, baby

I get a little weak now and I cry sometimes, yeah
I don't mind, I don't mind
I love you baby, love you baby, love you baby, love you baby

That's the way I feel, let me just talk about it a little while
You'll see right now, that's the way that I, that's the way that I
That's the way that I, that's the way that I, that's the way

Yeah, that's the way, that's the way, that is the way, oh
I feel about you, baby, that's the way that I, that's the way I
That's the way that I, that's the way I, oh
That's the way that I I feel about you, baby, ooh, baby

Think about you all the time and I'm so glad
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, so glad, I'm so glad
So glad to know you're my love now, baby
Stay my baby, sure you gonna do that for me, sure
Sure you gonna do that for me now that I have been alone

Let me know that that's the way
Let me know that that's the way
That you'd be, that you'd be always true
The way I feel
