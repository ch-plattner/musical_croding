You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Darlin’ trust mine

If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Darlin’ trust mine

Because it means so much to me
For you to know that I’m real
I’ll stand by your side
And our love will be our shield

If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Darlin’ trust mine

I know you’ve had many disappointments
It’s in the making of the world going ’round
Happiness and heartaches share the same bed
The happy side’s where my love can be found

Oh darlin’, it means so much for me to find
Lord, help me find your love
And I’ll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Trust mine

It means so much to me
For us to find each other’s love
And I’ll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Trust mine
