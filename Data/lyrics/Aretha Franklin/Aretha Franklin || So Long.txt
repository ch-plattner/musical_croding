
So long I hope we'll meet again
One day
And I'm hoping maybe then you'll say
Darling I found out I was wrong
So long
You leave me here to cry
It will never be goodbye
Because you been mine so long
All alone
With my memories of you
I can dream that you're lonely like me too
You're my home
Even though we're far apart
I'm gonna keep you in my heart
So long, so long baby
Gee, I really hate to see you go
Because you are all and everything in my world and you know
That you been mine all mine so long
But baby I gotta say so long
