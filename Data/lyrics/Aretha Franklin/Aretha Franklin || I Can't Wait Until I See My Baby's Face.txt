When I tell him that I'm through
Yes, I'm through with him
'Cause he's been running round
And I got to, to put him down
I can't wait to see the look
The look in his eyes

I wonder if he'll cry 
When I tell him this is goodbye, yes it is
Or will he try to change my mind
And make me stay? yeah

Or will he turn around
And, with a smile on his face

Just walk away?
Just walk away

I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
Gotta find out what I mean
What I mean to him
'Cause just one tear is all he's got to, to shed for me
And I know that l will run, yes I'll run to him
I'll hold him tight
Never, never let him go, no-o-o

And I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
You know, I just can't wait until I see my baby's, baby's face 
You know, I just can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
I can't wait until I
