
I gave my heart and soul to you, girl
Now didn't I do it, baby didn't I do it baby
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh
Didn't I do it, baby didn't I do it baby

I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Yes sir

I thought that heart of yours was true, girl
Now, didn't I think it baby didn't I think it baby
But this time I'm really leavin' you girl oh
Hope you know it baby hope you know it baby

Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Yes sir

(Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it baby)
(Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it baby)

Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (oh)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Hoo
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Can't you see)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Ooh baby, ooh)

Girl, can we talk for a second
I know it's been a long time
Since some someone's blown your mind, like I did
There'll be other times, for me and you
And I can see the tears fallin' from your eyes

Tell me girl, did I blow your mind

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
