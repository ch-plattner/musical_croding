You know where to call me
And if you ever want me
You know where to write me
But you never call me
And no, you never write me
So, who needs you?
Who needs you?

Take a pen, a pencil
A hand, a little item
Or the telephone, dear
Why you want to fight'em
How much can it cost you
Why don't you get lost, dear?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

You came on like a big deal
And all that you could beg me
Listen Mister Big Wheel
All you do is drag me

When I really need you
You just can't be found, dear
And when I really want you
You're nowhere around, dear
So, all this big production
Leads to one deduction
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

You came on like a big deal
And all that you could beg me
But listen Mister Big Wheel
All you do is drag me

When I really need you
You just can't be found, dear
And when I really want you
You're nowhere around, dear
So, all this big production
Just leads to one deduction
Who needs you?
Who needs you now?
Who needs you?
Who needs you now?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
