In the evening, when the sun goes down
You’re gonna find me, doin’ 
what I’m doin’ right now, and next just sitting around
The night life, it ain’t no good life
But it’s my life, yes it is

And all good people, good people, just like you and me
They’re sitting around dreaming
Sitting around dreaming about that used to be
Well, the night life, ask anybody if that it ain’t no good life
But that’s alright because it’s my life, oh, yes it is

Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what they’re playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what they’re saying
What they seem to be playing to me that’s, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not to have loved at all
If they had know that they couldn’t pay the cost

Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams
Well, the night life, what I’m doin’ right now ain’t no good life
But that’s alright with me, because it’s my life, yes it is
I tell you that the night life sure ain’t no good life
Well, but it’s my life, yes it is, yeah
