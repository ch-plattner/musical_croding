It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible

Yes, David was small
But, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my

You've ever heard 'bout Jonah?
He lived in a whale
You've ever heard 'bout Jonah?
He lived, lived in a whale
And he made his home in that fish's abdomen
Yes Jonah, he lived in a whale

To get into heaven
Don't snap for a seven
Live clean and don't have no fault
And take me, yeah, take that gospel
Whenever it's possible
But with a little grain of salt

Methuselah lived 900 years
Methuselah lived 9,900 years

It ain't necessarily
It ain't, no, necessarily
It ain't, it ain't necessarily so

Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily
