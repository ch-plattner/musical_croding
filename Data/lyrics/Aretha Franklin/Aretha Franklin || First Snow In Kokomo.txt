
The first snow in Kokomo...
Off an Indiana highway, I was on my way to Kokomo...

A funny friend named Chuck slipped and bumped his head (ooooops!),
And as we picked him up, asked us had his nose turned red...
That was the first snow in Kokomo...

Kenny learning to blow his horn...
I was feeling right up to it;
Could it be done? Yes, I could do it...
That first snow in Kokomo...

Jimmy Dee playing a bass he was learning to play;
Applegate discovered a coronet, almost right away...
Reggie expecting a baby, and was Freddie kinda blue!
That was the first snow in Kokomo...

Jimmy Dee has put his bass away (put away),
And I wonder if Applegate ever learned to play?
Kenny is really, really blowing his horn, 
And a baby named Moishe has been born... (Pretty little baby...)
Freddie's getting ready to make things right... (Right on, Freddie!)
Since that first snow, that first snow in Kokomo...

(First snow in Kokomo...)
(The first snow in Kokomo...)
