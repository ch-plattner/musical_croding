
It brings big tears into my eyes
When I begin, when I begin to realize
That I've cried so much, oh, since you've been gone;
I guess I'll drown in, drown in my own tears...

I've been crying, just like a child;
These tears of mine, these tears are runnin' wild...
And if you don't think... if you don't think that you'll be home soon,
Baby, I'm gonna drown... oh, yeah... in my own tears...

Here without you (you), 
I get so lonely and I sure get blue (blue), yes, I do...
It seems to keep rainin' (rainin'), 
Rainin', and raining more and more, and more and more... (More and more...)
Oh, here without you, baby,
I sure get lonely and I get so blue,
And every time I look around, it's rainin',
More, and more, and more, and more, and more...

Oh, why can't you? (You...) Why can't you...
Why can't you come on home? (You come on home...)
Because I don't wanna be, I don't want to be here all alone...
Listen! if you don't think... (If! You! Don't!)
If you don't think that you're coming home soon (You don't think!), like this evening,
I believe I'm gonna drown (drown...) this morning...
I tell you that I'm gonna... (drown...) gonna drown this evening... 
And oh! (Drown...) It's sure gonna get bad in the midnight hour.
Don't let him let me! (Drown...) Don't let him let me,
Don't let him let me! Don't let him let me
Drown (goin' down...), in my own tears...
I don't wanna drown (drown...) in my own tears...
Oh, I'm gonna drown... yeah, in my... 
Oh, in my own tears, tears, my tears, tears!
Oh! Don't let him do it, don't let him do it;
I don't wanna drown in my own tears...
