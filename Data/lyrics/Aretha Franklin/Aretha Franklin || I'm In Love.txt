I’m in love, yes I am
I’m in love, yes I am, uh
I’m in love, hey baby, hey, you know I am
I’m in love, uh, huh, you know I am

Friends all wonder what’s come over me
I’m as happy as any girl could be
(Love, love, love) I’m in love
(Love, love, love) Believe me I am
(Love, love, love) I’m in love, oh
(Love, love, love) Yes sir I am, yes sir I am, yes sir I am
(Love, love, love) Hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love) I’m in love

And I’m so glad that it’s me who had to change
I’m sproutin’ and bloomin’ like the last summer rose
(Love, love, love) I’m in love
(Love, love, love) I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
(Love, love, love) I’m in love, I’m in
(Love, love, love)

I’m in love
(Love, in love, in love)  
In the mornin’
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
I wake up smilin’ and shinin’
(Love, in love, in love) I’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
Smilin’ like love I know where it’s at
(Love, in love, in love) I’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
I’m in love
(Love, in love, in love) I’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  Yes I am
(Love, in love, in love) Um, I’m in love
