It's in the way you say my name
Though I hear your voice
It's not the same
And in your eyes 
I can't help but see a much different light
Than there used to be

You say hello and I want to die
'Cause deep down I know that it means goodbye
I can't let go, I just keep hanging on
Though you're standing there, you're as good as gone
Though you're standing there, you're as good as gone

Are you falling out of love
Baby, have you had a change of heart
Are you falling out of love
Tell me is there someone new
That you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love

Your funny smile was all it took
And you said it all with just a look
Now I sit here, and you sit there
We just talk and talk, but we get nowhere
All we do is talk, and get nowhere 

Are you falling out of love
Baby, have you had a change of heart
Are you falling out of love
Tell me is there someone new
That you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love [Repeat]
