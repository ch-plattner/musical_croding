
Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
Ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned

Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

Oh, it ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It just ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
Ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

Stop trying to be someone you're not
How cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got?
And if you need me like you say, say you do
Oh then please, please
Please don't you know that I need you?

Oh, it ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way
It ain't no way, it ain't no way, baby, no
It just ain't no way
It sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
No way
If you won't let me
Ain't no way
