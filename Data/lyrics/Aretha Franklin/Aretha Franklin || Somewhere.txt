
There’s a place for us
Somewhere there is a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
It waits for us somewhere

There is a time for us
I know that there is a time for us
Time together with just a little bit of time to spare
Time to learn, oh, time to care

Somewhere
We’ll find a new, a new way of living
We’ll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There is, there is a place for us
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There is a place for us

Hold my hand and we’re halfway there
Hold on to my hand and I’ll, I’ll take you there
Someday, some, somewhere
I’ll take you somewhere
