
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on 
Holdin' on to something true 
To what feels good to you 
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you 
Do whatcha gotta do 

I know it gets hard sometimes 
To find a little piece of mind 
Gotta stay focused, gotta stay strong 
To all my people, hold on 
To what you have inside 
I know it hurts but don't cry 
Life is gonna go on 
With or without you, hold on 

Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on 
Holdin' on to something true 
To what feels good to you 
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you 
Do whatcha gotta do

Taking care of home and family 
Sometimes it's hard to keep your sanity 
Thinkin' what about my fantasies 
Will my dreams come true 
If I stay emotionless 
Release myself from all the stress 
Don't blame it all on you 
To myself, I'll be true 

We trade in our stability 
For all types of insecurities 
Now tell me what is to become 
Of me 
If I let myself stress
Every time life throws me a test 

Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on 
Holdin' on to something true 
To what feels good to you 
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you 
Do whatcha gotta do 
Do whatcha gotta do 

We trade in our stability 
For all types of insecurities 
Now tell me what is to become 
Of me 
If I let myself stress
Every time life throws me a test

Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on 
Holdin' on to something true 
To what feels good to you 
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you 
Do whatcha gotta do
