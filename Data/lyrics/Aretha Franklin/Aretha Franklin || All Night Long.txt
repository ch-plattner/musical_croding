
Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's in every dream I dream
All night long

Mmm, never heard him speak a single word of love
Never knew his favorite song
Because he only speaks to me in dreams I dream
All night long

When I'm asleep
He tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best, a dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand, he'll disappear

No, no, no, no, no

No, I don't need a lover that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so wrong?
Now I've got to find a man who's haunting me
All night long

All night long
All night long
All night long
