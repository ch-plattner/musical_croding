
You're more than just a joy, baby
You're more than just a joy, baby

Loving you tenderly is just what I need for me
Oh, the way you warm my buns sweet
Honey begins to run

You're more than just a joy, baby
You're more than just a joy
You're more than just a man, baby

Takes my kind of woman to understand you, baby
I'm sweet willing proof
Your one woman stock, best of breed
You know when I show I'll be just what my baby needs

You make it so easy
So easy to please me
I've had so many to find out
I really haven't had any
Your sincerity, baby, makes me true
I'm gonna stretch on out right here
And just go ahead and do what I've got to do

Give me good feelings beyond my mind's belief
But when it's finally over
I must confess that I'm relieved

You're more than just a joy, baby
You're more than just a joy
