Though you don’t call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I’ll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I wanna tell you, baby
Changes I’ve been going through (uuuh)
Missing you, listening you
‘Till you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I’m gonna swallow my pride (my pride)
I’m gonna beg you to please, baby please see me (you never want to see me)
I’m gonna walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true (uuuh)
All for you baby
‘Till you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (hear my plea)
I’ve got to make you see (make you see)
That our love is dying (our love is dying)

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must, somehow I must, how I must explain
I’m gonna rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m gonna camp by your steps
Until I get through to you (uuuh)
I’ve got to change your view, baby
‘Till you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
‘Till you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
‘Till you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

I’m gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby, I’m gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your, tap on your (tap on)
Tap on your , tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby
