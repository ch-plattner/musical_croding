
Now, listen here, girls
I’m gonna tell you
What I want right now

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And I’ll find him if I can

He’s got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me
So I know he cares
I want a man

Don’t want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldn’t cross

He’s got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring
Like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me
So I know he’s mine
I want a man

I’m looking for a guy
Who’s big and strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy
Who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man, oh, yeah

I’m looking for a guy
Who’s raving strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy
Who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man

I want a man
I don’t want no creampuff, baby
Don’t want no butterfly
I want a man

Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do
