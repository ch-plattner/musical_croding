How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

Just as soon as I see Jesus oh yes 
The man who made me free oh yes oh yes
He was the man that bleed and suffer oh yes oh yes oh yes
Who died for you and me oh yes

I wanna thank him 
Because he brought me oh yes 
Because he taught me oh yes oh yes 
I wanna thanke god because he kept me oh yes oh yes oh yes
Cause he left me oh yes

I wanna sing hallelujah 
I might shout this evening trouble over
I'm gonna thank Jesus for all he's done for me

Oh yell, how I got over, over 
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
Oh yell, how I got over, over 
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

I wanna wear a diamond gem
In the new Jerusalem
I wanna walk the street of gold
In the homeland of the old
I'm going to view the host in white
Who travel both day and night
Coming up from every nation
On the way to the great carnation

I will sing hallelujah
Trouble over
I wanna thank Jesus for all he's done for me 
How I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder
Soul look back and wonder
Soul look back and wonder
Soul look back and wonder how I got over

I wanna thank you thank you 
Thank you thank you

Thank you Lord thank you 
Thank you Jesus thank you Lord

You kept me 
And you never left me
Thank you Jesus

How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

Soul look back and wonder how I got over
Over, over
