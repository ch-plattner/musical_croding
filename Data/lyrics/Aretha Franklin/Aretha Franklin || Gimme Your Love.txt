
It's an evil wind
That blows no good, yeah
It's a sad heart
That won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome
(Oh how lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)
It's a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me
It's a heartache, yeah
(It's a heartache)
When love is gone
(Baby it's a heartache)
But it's bad
(Bad)
And even sad
(Sad)
Oh later on
And there's no one blinder
Than you won't see
It's a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share some of your love with me
I can't help it, oh no
He is gone
I must try to forget
Because I've got to live on
Oh, it's a good thing it's a sweet thing
(It's a sweet thing)
To love someone
(Such a sweet thing)
But it's bad
(Bad)
And even sad
(Sad)
When it's not returned
Oh, how lonesome, how lonesome, how lonesome
(Oh how lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)
I tell you it would be a shame
(Shame, shame)
A shame if you don't share your love with me
(Share your love with me)
It would really be a mistake baby
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me
(Share your love with me)
It would sure be a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share, share your love with me
(Share your love with me)
