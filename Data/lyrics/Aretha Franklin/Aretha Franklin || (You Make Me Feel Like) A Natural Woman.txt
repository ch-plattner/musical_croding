Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along, to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

Oh, baby, what you done to me?
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
