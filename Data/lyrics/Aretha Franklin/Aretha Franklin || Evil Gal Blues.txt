I said I'm an evil gal don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
Well I'll empty your pockets and fill you with misery, yes I will!
If you tell me good mornin'
I'm gon' tell you that's a lie
If you say hello baby I'mma give you the evil eye
I'mma evil gal don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
I'm gonna empty your pockets and fill you with misery, yes I will
I want caviar for breakfast, champagne every night,
I want a midnight snack for every man that I invite
I'm an evil gal don't you mess around with me, no
So goodbye baby I'm gonna set you free
Whoa if you wanna be happy honey don't you mess around with me
I said if you wanna be happy don't you mess around with me, no
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and fill you with misery
Yeah yeah oh I'm evil

Oh if you wanna be happy don't you hang out with me, no more
I said if you wanna be happy, honey, don't you hang out with me
You'd better not
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll set you free
And I'm so proud that's how I am!
