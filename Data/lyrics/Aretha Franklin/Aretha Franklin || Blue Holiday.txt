
It's been a blue holiday since you've been gone
Oh my darling, won't you hurry, hurry home
It's been a blue holiday I'm all alone
You know I, I need your love to keep me warm
I cry when I hear the chapel bells ring
And sometimes I cry all through the night
Please oh please come, come back to me
And make my holiday bright
It's been a blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again

Blue blue blue blue blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again
I pray to have your love again
It's been a blue blue holiday
