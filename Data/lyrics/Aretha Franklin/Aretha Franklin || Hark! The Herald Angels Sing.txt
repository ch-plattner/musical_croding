Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ was born in Bethlehem

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a newborn King

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the ever, everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a Virgin's womb

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory, glory, glory to a new born King

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners, sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ was born in Bethlehem

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King

A new born King
A new born King
