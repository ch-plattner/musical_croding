Yes, it's love, so much love
You are the one

I can't admit that I was wrong
Took you for granted now I'm all alone
It was so silly all the things we say
And all the words of pain runnin' through my head

If I had the chance I'd let you know
I'll tell you that I never want you to go
These tears I cry won't let me rest
Till you return

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

It hurts, oh baby, you know you hurt me

I can't believe that you would leave me
I always thought you would stand by me
The thought of you in another arms
Is very slowly tearing me apart

What can I do to make you see?
Everything you need is here with me
I really miss the things that we used to build
And don't you miss the way I used to love you?

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

You used to kiss me
You used to hold me
You used to love me
You used to touch me

All night long you made everything alright
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Things have stayed the same
And all I'm really tryin' to say, I'm the one to blame

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts
