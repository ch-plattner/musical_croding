
I would like to see a show of hands
Nothin' concealed, roll up your sleeve
Nothin' up my [?] except my heart
And I believe we've come apart

I would like to see you play your cards
Reveal your hands and show your heart
Maybe we could get it back

With truth and honesty that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free
Before we find that it's gone
We could pull it back together, truth and honesty
Open up your hands, show me your heart

Let's stay up till dawn and talk it out
Nothin' concealed, no alibi, retunin' to light
Before we start, then all we do is fall apart
If I can see the sunlight in your eyes

Then maybe we all could shine, yeah
Maybe we could get it back, oh baby, yeah baby

Oh, truth and honesty that is what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose, sad and free
Before we find out all that is gone
We could pull it back together with truth and honesty, oh
Open up your hands, show me your heart

Truth and honesty, oh, that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free
Before we find out that it's gone
We could pull it back together, truth and honesty

Truth and honesty, you know what we need, sure enough within
To the good stuff, the good stuff baby
You got to be real, you got to be real, you got to be sugar
To the good stuff we believe in, you got to, you got to
