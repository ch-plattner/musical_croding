You made me love you
I didn’t want to do it (no, no)
I didn’t want to do it (no, no)
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes
And then you made me sad
And there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn’t want to tell ya (no, no)
I didn’t want to tell ya (no, no)
I want a love that’s true
Yes I do, you know I do, indeed I do

Give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I’d die for
You know you made me love you

Ah, you made me sigh for
I didn’t want to tell ya (no, no)
I didn’t want to tell ya (no, no)
I want a love that’s true
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do

Give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I’d die for
You know you made me love you

Ooooh, give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I’d die for
You know you made me love you
