Shoo doo, shoo.... 

Oh, many say that I'm too young 
To let you know just where I come from 

Oh, but you will see that it's just a matter of time 
My love will surely make you mine 

Ooh, living in a world of ghetto life 
Everybody around seems so uptight 

Nothing's wrong 
It's alright with 
My man, my man 

I like the kinds of ways we have our fun 
His loving ways send me on and on 

Yeah, hey, with my man 
People out there can understand 

I'm giving him something he can feel 
Oh, ho, to let him know my love is real 
Hey, hey, hey... 
I'm giving him something he can feel 
Yes, I am, babe
To let you know my love is real 

So much love for us to see
So much hope for material things 
Are they only in my dreams 

So I wrote this song for you 
To prove that real things do come true 
Tell me, tell me what it means
I wanna know, baby 

If you don't want it to get away 
Everybody around seems so uptight 
Nothing's wrong it's alright, my man 

I like the kinds of ways we have our fun 
His loving ways sends me on an on 
Woo, with my man 

People out there can you understand 
I'm giving him something he can feel 
I sure want you to have it, baby 
To let you know my love is real 
My love is real 

Giving him something he can feel 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
I want you to know this love 
Yeah, yeah 

Giving him something he can feel 
To feel it, feel it all 
I love you, I love you, I love you 

Giving him something he can feel 
Let me give what what you really need, baby 

Giving him something he can feel 
Can you feel it, can you feel it, feel it, feel it 

Giving him something he can feel 
Ooh, we feel it, baby 
Giving him something he can feel 
Yeah, yeah, yeah..... 

Giving him something he can feel 
Feel it, baby 
Feel it, baby 
Feel it, baby 

Giving him something he can feel 
Yeah, feel it, baby 
You're gonna know my love is real 
Yeah, baby 

Giving him something he can feel 
Every day, baby 
You're gonna know this love is real 
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

You know, baby 
I just can't get enough of your funky stuff, no, no 
Oh, oh, baby 
You make it so good
You turn a woman around 
Yes, you will 
And I wanna run it 
And tell it all over town 

Living in a world of ghetto life 
Everybody around seems so uptight 
Nothing's wrong
And it's alright, my man 
I like the kind of ways we have our fun 
Your loving ways send me on an on 
Yeah, with my man 

People out there can you understand 
Giving him something he can feel 
To let him know this love is real 

Giving him something he can feel
To let him know this love is real 

Do you know 
Do you know 
Do you know 

Giving him something he can feel 
Giving him something he can feel....
