(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Look at my love floating away)

He's the kind of guy that would say
Hey, baby let's get away
Let's go some place, huh
Well I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
You trust your heart, share all of your love
Till death do you part

I want to be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm lovin' him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say

(Hey, baby, let's get away)
(Let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we)
Well, I don't care
(Hey baby let's get away)
(Let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we)
Well, I don't care

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' loved starved
I'll be there to feed it
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say

(Hey, baby, let's get away)
(Let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we)
Well, I don't care

(Hey baby let's get away)
(Let's go somewhere far)
(Baby can we)
Well, I don't care

(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Look at my love floating away)
(Daydreaming) of you
(Daydreaming)
Thinking of you

Day... dreaming
Day... dreaming
