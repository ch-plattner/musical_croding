
I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue, yeah
'cause I've been waiting here for somebody, baby
Ah, yeah, exactly like you
Uh-huh

Why should we spend all of our money
On a show or two
When nobody makes those love scenes, honey
Ah, exactly like you

Now you make me feel so grand
I want to give this world to you
And you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreamin'
And schemes I'm schemin', yeah

I know why my daddy
Taught me to be true, yeah
'cause he was keepin' me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you

Now you make me feel so grand
I want to hand this great big wide world to you
And you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreamin'
And oh, schemes I'm schemin', yeah

I know why my daddy
The man taught me to be true, uh-huh
'cause he was savin' me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you
Oh, exactly, ah baby
Like you.
Exactly like you
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Exactly, exactly, exactly, oh, like you
Oh baby
Somebody, somebody...
