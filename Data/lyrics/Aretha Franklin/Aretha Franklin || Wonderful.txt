Feels like I've seen you before 
Maybe in a past life, you were mine and I was yours 
'Cause the vibe we share feels so comfortable 
Is it possible someone could make me lose control 

Look what you've done to me (Mmm) 
Finding it hard to breathe 
'Cause I just can't believe 
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you 

I had to pinch myself (Oh) 
'Cause nobody else has (Yeah, yeah) 
Given me such a chill 
And made me feel the way that you do 

I just gotta let you know 
In case you didn't know 
I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful 
There's this thing you do to me 
That thing that makes me weak 
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful 

Questioning what this is 
If it's too good to be true 
I don't wanna fool myself 
'Cause I'm fallin' hard for you 

Givin' me that old school love 
Sayin' I'm the only one 
Showin' me in so many ways 
That you're crazy for me 

Look what you've done to me (Oh, baby) 
Finding it hard to breathe 
'Cause I just can't believe 
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you 

I had to pinch myself (Ow) 
'Cause nobody else has 
Given me such a chill 
And make me feel the way that you do, baby 

I just gotta let you know 
In case you didn't know 
I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful 
There's this thing you do to me 
That thing that makes me weak 
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful 

I'd go anywhere 
Far away from here 
It would be okay 
As long as you are there 

You take away my pain 
And I'll never be the same 
You've got my heart, baby 
And I just want to say, baby 

I just gotta let you know (Sweet thing, yeah, yeah) 
In case you didn't know (Woo) 
I-I-I (I-I) I-I-I (I-I-I think you're wonderful, baby) 
think you're wonderful 
There's this thing you do to me (This thing you do to 
me, baby) 
That thing that makes me weak 
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful (I-I think you're 
wonderful, yeah) 

I just gotta let you know (Ooh, baby) 
In case you didn't know (In case you didn't know) 
I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful 
There's this thing you do to me 
That thing that makes me weak 
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful
