
Inside my mind the hands of time rewind
To when you’re love was mine so magically
We shared a song and even though it’s gone
I can still recall the melody
Don’t be scared if you lie awake in the dark  (I won’t be afraid, baby)
Cause I still truly care with all my heart

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

So soft and pure, your love was the cure
Then I felt lost and so alone
Now it’s my turn to give you what you yearn
Return the love that you have always shown
And what a joy if I could see you once again  (oh, I see you tonight, baby)
I will treat you so right you’re my body and soul

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Oh, tonight, oooh, tonight I’ll be there, yeah, oooh

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend  (when you need a friend)
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight  (I’ll stay with you late, with you baby)
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
Tonight
