
With pen in hand 
You sign your name
Today at five 
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone

If you think 
We can't find the love we once knew
If you think 
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire 
To kiss me
Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had
If you don't think 
They out weigh the bad
Well then go ahead
Sign your name
And I'll be 
On my way
I'll be on my way
