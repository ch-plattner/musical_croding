Hear me baby,
Hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me 
Hear me boy

Nobody knows me
Not like the way you know me
Nobody showed me 
The ways of love
So now when you hold me
And promise you wont control me
My mama told me 
To always be for sure

I wanna know 
Will you love me
I wanna know 
Will you care
In the morning

Oh I want you to treat me right
I don't want you to play with my mind
I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do

Will you love me

I want you to fill me
I'm ready and oh so willing
I'm willing to give you
Every part of me

I want you to touch and move me
You can consume me
Take all of me my love

I wanna know 
If you'll love me

I wanna know 
Will you care
In the morning

I want you to treat me right
Oh you cant, you cant, you cant, play with my mind
I don't want to be the other woman
No no no no no
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do
I want to know 
Do we have an understanding
I've got to know 
Are you giving or demanding
I cant give you no more
Cause I've poured out my soul 
All for you
All for you
I got to know
Is there someone else you're loving
Tell me have you got another woman

Can we share our lives?

I wanna know will you love me
I wanna know will you care
In the morning

I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do

I wanna know will you love me
I wanna know will you care
In the morning
