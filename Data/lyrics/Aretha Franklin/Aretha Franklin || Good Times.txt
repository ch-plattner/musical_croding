Everybody, get in the groove and let the good times roll;
I'm gon' stay here 'til I soothe my soul,
If it takes all night long... yeah...

It might be one o'clock, and it might be three;
Time don't mean that much to me!
I ain't had this much fun since I don't know when, 
And I might not feel this good again...

Oh! Get in the groove and let the good times roll;
I'm gon' stay here 'til I soothe my soul,
If it takes all night long, yeah...

All night - it takes all day...
All night, and all day...
I'm gonna get in the groove and let the good times roll...
Stay here 'til I soothe my soul! 
If it takes all night long... yeah...

It might be one o'clock, and it might be three;
I don't care, 'cause time means nothin' to me!
I ain't been swingin' since I don't know when, 
And I might not be swingin' this way again...

Oh! Get in the groove and let the good times roll;
You can stay here 'til you soothe your soul, 
If it takes all night long, yeah...

All night, and all day...
All night, and all day...
I'm gon' stay here - I ain't gonna move;
Come on, soul brotha, help me find the groove!
I don't care who's knockin' on the door...
