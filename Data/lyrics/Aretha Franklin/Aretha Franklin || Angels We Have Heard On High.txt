
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their sweet refrain

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ, whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we praise

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo

Merry Christmas
From the Franklin's to all of you
