Think (think) think (think) think (think)
Think (think) think (think) think (think)

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you, you couldn't have been too much more than ten. (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
It don't take too much high IQ's to see what you're doing to me

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, if you keep doing things I don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walking around everyday, playing games, taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds.
Well be careful, you're gonna lose yours.

Yeah, think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing we can do

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, if you're doing things I don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing we can do

(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
Think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
Think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
Think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
Think about - ah me, think about it)
You had better stop and think before you think, think!
