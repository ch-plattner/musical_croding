If you need a lover
Truer than any other
Come on & see me
If you need a heart
That will never tear apart
Come on & see me
'Cause I've got a true love just for you, love
& it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come & get it
I say if you want it, better come & get it

If you need a lover
That'll stick right by you, brother
Come on & see me
I'll stand by your side
I'll dry your weepin' eyes
Come on & see me
'Cause I've got joy, love, for some boy, love
& it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come & get it
I say if you want it, better come & get it

Ba-a-by (come on & see me now)
Su-yu-gar (come on & see me now)
Ho-yo-ney (come on & see me now)
'Cause I've got joy, love, for some boy, love
& it can be yours eternally

[repeat & fade]
If you want it, better come & get it
Ba-a-by, baby (come on & see me now)
If you want it, better come & get it
Su-yu-gar, sugar (come on & see me now)
If you want it, better come & get it
Ho-yo-ney, honey (come on & see me now)
