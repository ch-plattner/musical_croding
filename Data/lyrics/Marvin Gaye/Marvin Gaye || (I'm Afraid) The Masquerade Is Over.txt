
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love
