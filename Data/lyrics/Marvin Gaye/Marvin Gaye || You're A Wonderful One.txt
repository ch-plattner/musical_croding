
You are so wonderful
That being near you is all I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[From now on, backing vocals: "Wonderful one"]
In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothin', baby, in return
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darlin', you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hmm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence you speak to me
Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek
It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Repeat and fade:]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
