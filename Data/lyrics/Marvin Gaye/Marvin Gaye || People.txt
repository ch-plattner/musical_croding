People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world 
We're children, needing other children 
And yet letting a grown-up pride 
Hide all the need inside 
Acting more like children than children 
Lovers are very special people 
They're the luckiest people in the world 
With one person one very special person 
A feeling deep in your soul 
Says you were half now you're whole 
No more hunger and thirst 
But first be a person who needs people 
People who need people 
Are the luckiest people in the world 
With one person one very special person 
No more hunger and thirst 
But first be a person who needs people 
People who need people 
Are the luckiest people in the world
