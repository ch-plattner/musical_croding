[TT:] There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire & keeps the flame inside me
I love it, Marvin
[MG:] Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Somethin' inside me keeps me yearnin', ooo baby

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

[TT:] Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe
[MG:] Near to you, I feel so strong
& I know I can right any wrong
Lovin' you gives me the power that I always need

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

[MG:] Baby, tell me baby
[TT:] Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you
[MG:] That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Givin' my love to you, dear

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no
[MG:] Tammi, I'll never stop, stop
[BOTH:] No no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, no no no no
