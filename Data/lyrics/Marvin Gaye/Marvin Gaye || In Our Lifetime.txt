(Funk, funk, funk for love)
(Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong
Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong...)

It's the love funky music and the feeling can't control
Oh no, funky music and the rhythms in my soul
Hey, sweet love funky music and the beats in my head
I love funky music and my lady understands

She can be funky, he can be funky, I can be funky too
With your love
You can be funky, we can be funky, I can be funky too
With some of your love
Home is where you live and play and laugh and be happy
Making love every day
We already know how to blues it

Sweat down my spine, feeling fine
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
Take every chance to make romance
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
What do I have now that is my greatest gift?
And it came to me one day, this is what it is

It's love that I'm looking for, baby, oh darlinâ€™
Said it's love, baby, that I want to be about, oh baby
Hey hey love, baby, that I want to be, ooooh
Said it's love, what I want and really need, baby - yeah!
I need your attention, baby, yeah yeah, looking for more love
Honey, do you, do you want me, baby, hey, to give you my love?
Ohh, baby

Sometimes I don't need to cry
But there are the pitfalls of life
Here come the tears in my eyes
We accept the pleasure, we, we accept the pain
Oooh, heart, my heart
Oh baby, my heart
Oooh baby, my heart
Oooh, oooh baby, my heart
Come on baby, give up some love

Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best
Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best

Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Please let's all get funky if you take the good
Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Come let's all get funky if you take the good

It's alright baby, to get funky
Oh baby, it's alright to get funky with love's creation, baby
Get funky, baby, funky with love
Now, uh, folks have said the world is coming to an end, baby
I wonder... in our lifetime?
Oh well, let's make love
