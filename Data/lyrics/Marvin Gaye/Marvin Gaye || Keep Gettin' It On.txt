Okay
Talk about gettin' it on
Keep gettin'it on, keep gettin' it on
Early morning, should talk about gettin' it on
Keep gettin' it on, keep gettin' it on, keep gettin' it on

You wanna have, some good
Lovin' and plenty good time
Don't just talk about it
Everybody starts gettin' it on
Keep gettin' it on, keep gettin' it on, keep gettin' it on

Would you rather make love children?
As opposed to war, like a no shoe way
Don't you want to love somebody, think about the people
Makes you feel so good, yeah come on
Don't you want somebody
Think about the good life
You got the good decision
Come on just bring it on now
What you waiting for?

Oh Jesus, trying to tell the people
To come on and get it on yes Lord
Just get it on, oh no the nightmare
Come on, oh Lord get it on right now
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Come on, you won't be so lonesome, you get it on
Get it on, lonesome some body to get it
You know you gotta come out and get it on
Get it on, you come on
Get it on, got to get it on
Get it on, got to get it on
Get it on, get it on, let's get it on
