
Oh I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me, true love is hard to find

So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find
That's what they would say

The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find

Sometimes I get so lonely
It seems useless to groan
But then I remember
Somewhere true love has waited there
But I'll keep on holding on
Keep on keeping on
But I know that I keep trying
I can lose
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh

There is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
You know that I'm gonna keep holding on
Cause I now if I keep trying
I can't lose, cause there's no denying
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Ohhh
Seek and you shall find
If it's love that you're looking for
Seek and you shall find
It must be right around the corner
Seek...
