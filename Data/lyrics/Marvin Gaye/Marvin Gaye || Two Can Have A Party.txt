
Who needs the noise of a party crowd
Who needs the records turned up loud
When two, we two can have a party all alone?
Oh yeah

Ooo pretty music, a cozy chair
Lights down low and I'm holding you near
Oh baby, we two can have a party all alone
Oh yeah

[Twice]
When we are together, I'm like a feather
Floating in the air
I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you are there
Oh baby
Me and you, you and me
We can have a party, just wait and see
Oh well, two, we two can have a party all alone
Yes we can

Baby, two, we two can have a party all alone
Nobody else, you and me, hah, all alone
Pretty, pretty music, a cozy chair, yeah
...and fade
