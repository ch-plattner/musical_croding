
Every day that passes by
I think about the new love you found
And my eyes cloud up and cry
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round

I spend my saddest moments
After the sun goes down
That's when my heart starts aching
'cause I want you 'round
I want you round

No matter where I travel
In the country or a town
My lips call out your name
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round baby
I want you 'round
I want you 'round
