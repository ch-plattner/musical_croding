[Marvin:]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you
Have you asked why
You seem to fall in love and out again
Do you really ever love
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why fool yourself
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, oh, love, love

[Diana:]
Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel
This time decide
That you will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharin' love you feel within
So jump right in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, oh, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, love, love

[Both:]
Darlin', darlin', stop and look
(Stop right now and listen to your heart)
Oh, listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'
(Can't you see that it's not too late)
Stop and look
And listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'

Stop and listen to your heart right now
(Stop, look)
(Listen to your heart hear what's it's sayin')
Oh, can't you see that it's not too late
(Stop, look)
(Listen to your heart hear what it's sayin')
Darlin', stop and look
And listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'
Stop, baby
(Stop right now and listen to your heart)
And listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'
(Ooh, ooh, can't you see that it's not too late)
