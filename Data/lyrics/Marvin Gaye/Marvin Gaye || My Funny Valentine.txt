
My Funny Valentine,
Sweet comic valentine -
You make me smile, with my heart.

Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you'r my fav'rite work of art.

Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me,
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day.

[musical interlude]

Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
are you smart?

Don't baby don't change a hair for me,
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day.
