By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry.
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
for I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance
over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
that I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye,
everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them,
break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home.
wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh,
that's my home
and I like it that way.
