Oh, oh my darling
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say

There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'

There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane

Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side

Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light

Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing

Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test

Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed

Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster

The Devil have his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners

Ay, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price
