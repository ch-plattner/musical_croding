
Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

[Chorus:]
(Don't you know you)
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

Hey look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

[Chorus]

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby

Darlin', you give me your joy, am I your toy
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishin', hopin')
All through the years we have no fears
(Now I'm cryin')
You leave the tears fallin' for years

[Chorus]

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby
[...and fade]
