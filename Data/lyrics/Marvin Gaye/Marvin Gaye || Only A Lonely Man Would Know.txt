Ooh, once I thought that
Love was a toy for girls and boys
I never gave my heart
I just played the part right from the start

Then there was you, sweet you
With a love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Oh, just hangin' on, now love has gone

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside of me, since I left my pride
Make a fool of me

Ask any lonely man, you see, darlin'
Walk up and ask any lonely man like me, baby

Ooh, foolishly girl, I broke your heart
Now we're apart
Now, in my lonely room, I
Just reminisce, long for your kiss

And through my lonely tears
I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love
My world, my world's at an end

Blinds closin' in, now, I know
Oh, what I was too slow in learnin'
Oh, now I know
No that I'm all alone, my heart is yearnin'

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ask any lonely man, you see, baby
Go on and ask him, baby

Only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ooh, only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside
