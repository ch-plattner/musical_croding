[Marvin:]
Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus:]
[Tammi:] Heaven must have sent you from above
[Both:] Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[T:]
And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'

[Chorus]

[M:] To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
[T:] I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

[M:] What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
[T:] And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

[Repeat chorus and fade]
