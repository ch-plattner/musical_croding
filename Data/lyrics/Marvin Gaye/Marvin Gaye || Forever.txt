
Darlin', forever, forever
You can break my heart
Forever, if you want to
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, darling, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

I'll be your slave
For the rest of my days
Love you more in so many ways
Just to be with you thrills me through and through

And darlin', forever, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, forever, I'll love you so
[...and fade]
