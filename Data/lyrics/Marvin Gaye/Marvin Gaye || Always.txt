always and forever
each moment with you
is just like a dream to me
that somehow came true
and i know tomorrow
will still be the same
cuz we got a life of love that
wont ever change

[Chorus]
Everyday love me
your won special way
melt all my heart
with a smile
take time to tell me
you really care
and we'll share tomorrow
together always forever love you
I'll always love you forevver

ever ever ever
baby
