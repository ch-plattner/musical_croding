
You don't drive a big fine car.
You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far.
But baby, you got what it takes.

Satisfied, you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire.
You got what it takes for me.

You don't live in a beautiful place.
You don't dress with the best of taste.
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face,
But baby you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You've got what it takes for me.
Now when you're near me
My head goes around and round.
And when you kiss me
My love comes tumblin' down.
You send me

You got what it takes for me
You got what it takes for me
You got what it takes for me
