[MG:] Like a breath of spring you came
& as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything 'cause
[BOTH:] What you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

[TT:] You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you & I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time
[BOTH:] What you gave me is more than enough to last
What you gave me is more than enough to last

[BOTH:] Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
[MG:] Oh yeah, 
[TT:] Oh yeah
[MG:] & though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know
[TT:] Time has a way of showin' us
the things we really need
& no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
[MG:] Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
[BOTH:] 'Cause what you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

[TT:] I'm gonna live once again
[MG:] What you gave me, 
[BOTH:] is more than enough to last
[MG:] I love you, I love you
[BOTH:] Hey now, & what you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last
[fade]
