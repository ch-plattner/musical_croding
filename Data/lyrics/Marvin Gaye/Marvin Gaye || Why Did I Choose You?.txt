
Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
I saw the heart you hide so well...
I saw a quiet man, who had a gentle way,
a way that caught me in its glowing spell.

Why did I want you? What could you offer me?
A love to last a life-time through?
And when I lost my heart so many years ago,
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you.

If I had to choose again, I would still choose you.
