
There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind

And when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got

There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things you said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be

When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
Said when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got

Baby, ah baby, my little darling
I'm coming home

The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind

So when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
