In this life....of....happiness and sadness
when you've lost....out on love...
and it all...ends up in madness
and you say....Love....please go away don't torture me, night and day
then someone real.....someone who feel comes in.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody , she says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again........Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful
I tried not to let my heart step in
But what to do, baby 
What could I do
when somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Falling in love

Forever
So great, baby 
So love me
As though there was no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
See you later
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
