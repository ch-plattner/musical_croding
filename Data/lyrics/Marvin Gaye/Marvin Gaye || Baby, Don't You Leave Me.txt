Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't you break my heart
Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna grieve me?
Why do we have to part
Couldn't give my love to nobody else
You've got me feelin' sorry for myself
Baby, don't you leave me

Baby, I'm lonely
Oh, so lonely
When you left me before
That's when you promised
Oh yes, you promised
Not to leave me no more
You oughta hang your head in shame
The way you keep my little heart in pain
Baby, don't you leave me

Said you'd never let nothin' come between you and me
I'm yours and I guess I'll be yours till you set me free

Don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Don't you make me cry
Let's stay together
Always together
Till the day we die
You know you're comin' out hard to wait
You're gonna fool around and make it great?
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't leave me, baby
Baby, don't you leave me
Please don't go
Baby, don't you leave me
...and fade
