Baby please don't go
Don't you know I still love you so
Honey, Honey, Honey
Honey you know
I still care
And I still got lots of
Love to share
Ah, you for me, me for you
Ah baby we'll be going through
Love so deeply
'Til tomorrow
You have stolen my mind completely
Have a heart hey, hey, hey, hey
Hold me sweetly, now
'Til tomorrow

Baby, Baby
Baby please girl don't go, oooh
Don't you know I still love you so
Honey, if you leave me
I'll go crazy
I'll still care
Oh you know I'll still care for you

I'll just shed a tear
When you're gone
And wish you were here
