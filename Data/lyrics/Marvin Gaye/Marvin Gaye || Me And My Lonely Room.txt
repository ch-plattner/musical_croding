
Me and my lonely room
Snapping my fingers, pacing the floor
I sulk in my lonely room as I lay my weary head
Down then in comes you're vision you're vision once 
Again I cry in my pillow baby

Pacing the floor no were to go as I stroll through the streets
Dragging my weary head down then in comes you're vision you're vision once 
Again 
Then he goes boo hoo
[lyrics repeat and fade]
