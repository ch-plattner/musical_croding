[KW:] Yeah yeah, yes indeed 
[MG:] Mmmm yes indeed 
[KW:] Will you be lovin' me tomorrow 
Just like you're lovin' me today? 
Oh and always treat me right 
Never ever fuss and fight 
Come on baby, let me hear you say, say it for me 
[MG:] Yes indeed

[MG:] And when I ain't got no money 
Will you still be lovin' me, honey? 
Hmmm and when things go wrong 
Tell me, will you love me strong? 
Come on baby, let me hear you say 
[KW:] Yes indeed 
[MG:] Say it again
[KW:] Yes indeed

[BOTH:] We had such a beautiful love affair 
Now we have each other 
Vow to love no other 
And our love's beyond compare, oh yes indeed 
[MG:] Now yes indeed 
[KW:] Will you be lovin' me tomorrow 
Just like you're lovin' me today? 
[MG:] Tell me, when things go wrong 
Will you love me strong? 
[KW:] And I depend on you 
To always see me through
