[Backup singers:] Heaven must have sent you, I know

[Her:]
Every night I say a prayer
Before I go to sleep
Suddenly you were there
Your face so fine, your voice so sweet
In these arms of mine
I found you just in time
In this turn of the world
I was a lost and lonely girl
But then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)
I know (yes I know)

[Him:]
Funny how my empty heart
Used to feel like a heavy load
Suddenly you were there
Like a friend on a lonesome road
Right into these arms of mine
I found you, I found you just in time
'Cause I was a lonely man
Holding out my helpless hand
Then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)

[Both:]
Our time is here now
Now matter how the world is around
In your arms I find
Some kind of love and peace of mind
'Cause a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)
