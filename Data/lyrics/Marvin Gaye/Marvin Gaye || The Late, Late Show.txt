[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss! 
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] All night long

[MW:] Gee it's cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up & hold me tight
Stars above, they seem to know
We're putting on a late late show
[MG:] Hear the pretty music in the trees
See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

[MW (with MG echoing):] Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
[MW:] We kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss! 
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] All night long

[MW:] Then we amble back to my front door
Say good night & then we kiss some more
[MG:] Did you know I like it so?
It started at the late late show

[MW:] When you cuddle up & hold me so tight
Stars above, they seem to know, yeah
We're putting on a late late show

[MG:] See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

[MW (with MG echoing):] Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
[MW:] We kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss! 
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] All night long

[MW:] Then we amble back to my front door
Say good night & then we kiss some more
[MG:] Did you know I like it so?
It started at the late late show

[MW:] It started at the late late show, Marvin
[MG:] It started at the late late show
[MW:] Then you kissed me & you held me so tight, Marvin
[MG:] It's mellow, baby, ow! It started at the late late show
[fade]
