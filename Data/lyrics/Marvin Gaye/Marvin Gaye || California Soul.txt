Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
You can't forget
From sunrise to sunset

It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna get a hold on you

California soul
California soul

They say the sun
Comes up every morning
And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride
On the high tide
Whistle a melody

So the people started to sing
And that's how the
Surf gave birth untold to

California soul
California soul
When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause
It's really such a groove

Puts a brand new kind of
Thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're happy all day long

California soul
California soul

They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissing
They knew just what was missing

So happy they were
Rocking and reeling
Because that added
That loving feeling

To California soul
California soul

California soul
Now if they move you
Will it move you
It can groove, you, baby

California Soul now now now
California Soul, yeah
California Soul
Satisfaction, darling
