I wonder my darling...
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder...

My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking.
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now I wonder...

I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been traveling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know, what I wanna know is will it last?

Oh oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?

Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Oh yeah-he-he baby I wonder...

I've been through, I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm livin' life, livin' it just the same
I've been traveling, been traveling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know right now, what I wanna know is will it last?

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder my my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder

Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder
