(Together, together)
[MG:] We'd stroll the lane together
[MW:] Laugh at the rain, oh you know, together
[BOTH:] Sang love's refrain together
& we'd both pretend it would never end

[MW:] When we cried, you know we cried together
[MG:] Cast love aside together
[BOTH:] You're gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always be together

(Together, together)
[BOTH:] & we'd both pretend it would never end

[MW:] You stole the sunshine, oh you know
We're gonna be together
[MG:] & our hearts, our hearts that won together
[BOTH:] Oh you've gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always ([Backing:] always be)
We'll always ([Backing:] always be)
We'll always be ([Backing:] always be) together

[MG:] We're gonna be together
[MW:] Oh you know we, we just gotta be together
[fade]
