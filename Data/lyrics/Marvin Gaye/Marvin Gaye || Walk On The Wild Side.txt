Sinner, you've been swingin', not prayin'
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against goin' to heaven, six-to-one

You walk on the wild side, the Devil is waitin'
He's waitin' to take your hand
You walk on the wild side, you're walkin' with Satan
Away from the Promised Land
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

You better cross over, you better walk humble or you're gonna stumble
And Satan is waitin' to take your hand
You walk on the wild side, you walk on the wild side
Away from the Promised Land
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

The odds against going to heaven six-to-one
