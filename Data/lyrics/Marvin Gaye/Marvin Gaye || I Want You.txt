I want you, (& I want you)
The right way (& the right way)
I want you (Yes I do)
But I want you to want me too (Want me too)
Want you to want me, baby (& I wanna it 2 be the right way)
Just like I want you

I give you all the love I want in return sweet darlin'
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, oh baby

I want you - the right way
I want you
But I wan't you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you wanna care
Aint it lonely out there

I want you - the right way
I want you
But I wan't you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

[Repeat and fade]
