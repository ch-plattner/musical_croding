[Her:] One can have a dream, baby
[Him:] Two can make that dream so real
[Her:] One can talk about bein' in love
[Him:] Two can say how it really feels
[Her:] One can wish upon a star
[Him:] Two can make that wish come true, yeah
[Her:] One can stand alone in the dark
[Him:] Two can make the light shine through

[Chorus (Both):]
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

[Her:] One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery
[Him:] Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
[Her:] One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone
[Him:] Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home

[Chorus]
[Instrumental]

Just takes two, just takes two

[Her:] One can go out to a movie, lookin' for a special treat
[Him:] Two can make that single movie somethin' really kinda sweet
[Her:] One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinkin' that it's really nice
[Him:] But two walkin' hand-in-hand is like addin' just a pinch of spice

[Repeat chorus and fade]
