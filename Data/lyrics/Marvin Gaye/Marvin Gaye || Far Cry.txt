Don't wanna sing a song, get up and party
Baby, come on, just come on, girl, and I'll hold a party
Get up and dance and sing, I'm gonna hook you
Baby, you know I've got a yen to love you

Party with your heart and your soul is honkin' 'round and
Oh, baby, you know that you're mine, so won't you come on just
Party down so much, it's in your heart that-ooh, girl, hey
Jammin' with all your love, honey, honey
You know that your love's all mine, a party
Baby, baby, hey, come on get up and...
Girl, don't you know that it's alright - whoo!
Party on down

Hey!

Hey, oh you know, what it is, you know those are the reasons
Oh...
