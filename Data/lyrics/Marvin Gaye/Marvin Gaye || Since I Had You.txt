
This is the story of two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance they met at the neighborhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again. That said,
How much I've missed (it) since I had you

How much. How much.
Ooh I really wondered…girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How could say (wait) to me darling
Such a thrill….
But it's been so hard since I had you baby

Ah sugar, come on give me a break
Cause it's been so hard since I had you baby

My --- eyes must look serious
Cause when I look at you I get delirious
Your….voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again - baby

Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby

Big Daddy Rucker is sho' nuff playin'
Ahhh…this is a mello dance
Ouh…baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you
[ad lib] Come on, let this be the last dance

Since I had you girl I have wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey there hasn't been no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
Since I taste you loving I haven't seen no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
