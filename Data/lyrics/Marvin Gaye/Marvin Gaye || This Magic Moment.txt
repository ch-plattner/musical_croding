This magic moment, so different then so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened, hell, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, baby
Forever till the end, the end of time

Oh, oh, baby, this magic moment
Oh, baby

Ooh, sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, baby
Forever till the end of time

Oh, oh, baby, oh, honey
Oh, I know we'll last, we'll last, we'll last, we'll last forever
Oh, this magic moment, oh, gonna last forever, baby
Oh, I know, I know
