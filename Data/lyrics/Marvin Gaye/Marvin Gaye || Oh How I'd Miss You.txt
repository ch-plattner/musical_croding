[TT:] My lovin' heart would shake 
More than the earth could break 
If you should ever go 
You know my heart would break 
[MG:] If I lost your sweet embrace 
Even time could not erase 
The memories of you 
Tears would cover up my face

[CHORUS:] 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you, baby 
[MG:] I need you so 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you 
[TT:] Baby never go 
[MG:] I'll never leave

[TT:] My world would cease to be 
Without the love you give to me 
The chains around my heart 
Would never set me free 
[MG:] When my life had just begun 
My sky didn't have a sun 
You fill my every need 
So if you ever leave

[CHORUS] 

[Backing, x2]
(Oh how I'd miss you, baby baby)

[MG:] Oh you're always on my mind 
Losin' you would leave me blind 
Fill my heart forevermore 
Never leave my love behind 
[TT:] With the joy your love can bring 
To you I'll always cling 
If you took away your love 
It would be the end of things, &...

[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you 
[MG:] Oh baby 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you 
[TT:] Marvin, I need you so 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you 
[fade]
