They ask me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
But that won't be eas', you see
After all the things you've done for me
Told the men I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
'Cause without you, girl, I'm nothin' at all

[Chorus:]
How, how can I forget ya?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

Girl, I'm down on my bended knees
And I'm beggin' you please, beggin' you please
Woman, woman, don't set me free
'Cause right this moment in the sun
My life was wastin' away
Girl, your love gave me hope and strength
You're the reason I'm alive today
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the evergreens

[Repeat chorus and fade]
