[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it after get it?
[MG:] I wanna know, sugar darlin', yeah
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] Oh baby, 
[TT:] Sweet thing

[MG:] Now I think of games sometimes
But when it comes to this heart of mine
I don't miss a bus
If you ain't got the right stuff
So I'm laying it on the line
& it's somethin' you'd best be mine
Don't fight the fire without the words to give it up

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] Oh tell me sugar, tell me sugar
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] I wanna know right now

[TT:] Listen, your sweet talkin' sure sound good
& your kissin' satisfied
& when you hold me in your arms
I get weak, I won't deny
But I'm not in for a one-night thrill
You've got to have enough love to pull us all over the hill

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it? 
[TT:] I wanna know
BOTH: How you gonna keep it?
[TT:] I want you to think, think about it baby
Stop & start yourself
Don't let your mind ruin my heart
[MG:] Is what you're layin' on me fake
Or have you really got what it takes?

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it? MG: I wanna know
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it?
[TT:] If I let you be careful with my ship
[MG:] How you gonna keep it?
[TT:] I wanna know, will you be able to hold your grip?
[MG:] How you gonna keep it?

[repeat & fade:]
[BOTH: ]How you gonna keep it? ...
