Ooooh baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Oh honey
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

Ooooo, I read your letters you're not here
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Don't you know
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game, a fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

Oh, I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there

So glad we got the real thing baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh honey
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
No darling
Ain't nothing like the real thing 
Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
