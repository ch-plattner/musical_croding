Don't go away baby
Don't go away please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away
Don't go away

I'm askin' you darlin'
Please stay, please stay, please
Don't go away baby
Please stay baby, please
Don't go away, no
I couldn't stand it darlin'

I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without you beside me darlin', darlin anymore
No sugar, no I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby baby baby, like I was before
Oh baby

I'll just lie tossin' and turnin'
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
All night long
Scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up
I might find you gone

Baby please stay
Don't go away baby
Don't go away please stay
'Cause I could never find nobody
To make me feel this way
No, sugar

For I never felt this way before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh I never felt so good, honey before
Oh I never felt so good, oh before
Oh sugar 'cause you dig it, you got it
Oh I never felt so good
Oh I love you, I just love you

Oh now I never felt so good before
I love ya
Oh now I never felt so good before
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh
