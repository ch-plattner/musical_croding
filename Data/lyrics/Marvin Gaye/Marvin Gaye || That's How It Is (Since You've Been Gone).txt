[MG:] Oh baby, there's a letter on the floor
That I just can't read no more
'Cause the words upon its face are sayin' goodbye
There's a plate upon the table
Filled with food I could not eat
There's a made-up bed in the bedroom where I couldn't sleep
I just sit & weep
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[TT:] Now the curtains are drawn in my lonely room
& the darkness fills the air
& this old empty heart of mine is in despair
Even though the tears I shed
Washed the words away
I could still remember every word you had to say
They just wouldn't go away
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[Instrumental]

[MG:] Oh baby, you knew right from the start
That my heart was in your hands
[TT:] & your every, every wish, boy, was my command
That's why I can't understand
How you could leave me here helpless, dear
Alone & afraid, oh how could such a mistake be made?
But that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone, oh baby

[Both (repeat & fade):]
That's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone
