[Him:] Ooo heartburn, cold chills
Dizzy spells, I bite my fingernails
I don't think I'm gonna pull through
Everything depends on you
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine

[Her:] Oh dark days, empty nights
Without your arms to hold me tight
I don't know how long I'm gonna last
So come back baby, I'm sinking fast
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

[Her:] Baby, you left me in a burning condition
[Him:] And my love, to you, has become my affliction
[Both:] Ooo you know my need for you
Is oh so strong it's like fire set up in my bones
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

[Her:] Oh I don't think I'm gonna pull through
[Him:] Everything depends on you

[Repeat and fade:]
[Both:] Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine
