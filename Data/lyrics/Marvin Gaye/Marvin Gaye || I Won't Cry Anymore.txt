
I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you're gone
I've shed a million tears since we're apart
But tears can never mend a broken heart

I won't sigh anymore, I'll just forget you
And I'm closing the door of memories
Though you're the one love that my arms are longin' for
This is goodbye, I won't cry anymore
