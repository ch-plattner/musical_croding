
You can try to win my love, but it's just too late
Try & try again, but to lose me is your fate
You can walk the streets till your feet refuse
But you won't find me; you'll find only the blues
Oh nothin' but the blues, oh baby
So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win
No, you just can't win

[MG:] Oh baby, baby, honey
You did me wrong when my love was true
You just led me on; now I've gone away from you, darlin'
If you call me on the phone to remove your pain
There'll be a busy signal, or else an endless ring
Oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win, oh
[TT:] Oh baby, give in

[Instrumental]

[MG:] Tell me, what do you get when you call me, honey?
[TT:] Just an endless ring, oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
[Both:] So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win
[TT:] No, you just can't win
[MG:] Oh oh oh oh

[TT:] Oh baby give in, you know you just can't win
[MG:] Don't want your love no more, darlin'
[TT:] This stuff has got to stop
[MG:] Ah I can't stand it
[TT:] Don't need the love you got
[MG:] I don't want your love no more
[TT:] I've tried it before
[MG:] I don't want you no more, baby
[TT:] I don't need you no more
[...& fade]
