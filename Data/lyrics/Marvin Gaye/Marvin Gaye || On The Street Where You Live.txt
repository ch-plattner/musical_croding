
I have often walked down this street before; 
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before. 
All at once am I 
Several stories high,
Knowing I'm on the street where you live. 

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town? 
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town? 
Does enchantment pour 
Out of ev'ry door? 
No, it's just on the street where you live! 

And oh! The towering feeling 
Just to know somehow you are near! 
The overpowering feeling 
That any second you may suddenly appear! 

People stop and stare. They don't bother me. 
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be. 
Let the time go by, 
I won't care if I 
Can be here on the street where you live.
