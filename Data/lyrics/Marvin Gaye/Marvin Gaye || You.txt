
You, you I see in my mirror in the mornin'
Instead of seein' me
I see you, I see your face
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see someone else speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby

Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a heartbreakin' boy
Oh you've given your love to me
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet very far
So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts
We meet in shadows, your friends must never know
That we are lovers, darlin'
Alhough it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see
The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before
And never let it show without each other's souls
I'll never one-way track 'cause there's no turnin' back
Oh I need you baby

[Repeat verse 1 and fade]
