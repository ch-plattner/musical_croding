I don't why, but I do
I don't know why you thrill me like you do
I don't know why, but you do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do
