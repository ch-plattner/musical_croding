We'll be rockin' after midnight [Repeat]

After midnight, girl
After nidnight, baby
It's time to rock, ooh
Let me rock you, rock you
Rock you into midnight, baby

Let me rock you into love
I know you give me lots and lots of good lovin' baby
After midnight, baby
The time, the time is right for you and me tonight
But now we've got to dance

And soon after we make romance
You know I need your love
Worser than the stars above
Darling don't hesitate
After the date, oh, no, no, no-o-o
Sweetheart, your so good to me
Your precious lovin' can't be beat
Oh my sweet
I love the way you do your thing
Hey
I love all the joy you bring
I love the way you coochie-coo
And...
I love making love to you
Call out in the name of love
Call out in the name of tenderness
Call out in the name of sweet love
Call out in the name of happiness

I love the way you walk baby
And I really love the way you talk girl
And I really love the way you move
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me
Groove me, groove me, groove me
I love those little pretty ways

Want to be in love with you
For the rest of my days
And I even love the funky little things you do
I'm in trouble baby
I love your mind and your body too

My heart is yours to keep baby
And your happiness is all I see
And your love will be my last
Oh, I say good-bye to the heartbreak past

Oh, yes, I'm understood
Oh, baby do me good

I love the way you do your thing, hey
I love all the joy you bring
I love all your pretty ways
I love you the rest of your days
I love the way you coochie-coo, and
I love making love to you
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby

So tonight when the right time comes
I'll be getting some, get it, get it
So tonight when the right time comes
I'll be getting some
Having fun
[Ad lib]
