[T:] Hey Marvin! M: Yeah Tammi?
[T:] Listen to me baby
Take a plane a million miles and stay 100 years
And come back baby, and I'll be waiting here
I'll be true to you, I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cause this love I have is just for you to share
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you, ooo

[M]: I don't care to know how far I have to fly
I don't care to know how many stars are in the sky
There's just one thing, baby, that I've got to know
Will you love me forever, never let me go?
Oh Tammi! T: Yeah Marvin? M: Oh baby

[Both:] I'll be lovin' you, I can't help myself
I'll be lovin' you and nobody else
I'll be lovin' you, oh yes I will
[T:] Till I'm old and gray
[M:] Till my heart stands still, oh Tammi!
[T:] Oh Marvin, tell me why do you love me?

[M:] I was just a rollin' stone goin' nowhere
Empty like a hollow room filled with despair
Then, like a rainbow and a pot of gold
You came into my life and you saved my very soul
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you
[M:] Tell me, why do you love me?

[T:] I was so alone like a leaf without a tree
When out of the darkness your love lifted me
And I'm so grateful, baby I'm so glad
'Cause your sweet sweet love is the best I've ever had

[repeat and fade:]
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you, ooo
I'll be lovin' you, I can't help myself
I'll be lovin' you and nobody else
I'll be lovin' you, oh yes I will
[T:] Till I'm old and gray
[M:] Till my heart stands still
