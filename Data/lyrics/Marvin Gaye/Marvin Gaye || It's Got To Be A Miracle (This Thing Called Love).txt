[KW:] All it takes is 2 hearts that care
[MG:] Sprinkle just a little tenderness there
[KW:] And like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high
[MG:] Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] Take a boy like you & a girl like me
[MG:] 2 lonely people we used to be
[KW:] We shared a little time, tears & laughter
[MG:] It seems that we will be happy ever after

[KW:] All it takes is 2 arms that know
[MG:] They gotta hold you, baby, & never let go
[KW:] Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss
[MG:] We know that heaven must be like this

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] I used to wander, I used to roam
[MG:] Like a ship in a stormin' sea, tryin' to get home
[KW:] When we found each other, heaven found a way
[MG:] 'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day

[KW:] All it takes is just a little time
[MG:] 3 little words, baby, that mean "Will you will be mine?"
[KW:] Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed
[MG:] & every sweet word that's ever been said

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] Take a girl like me & a boy like you
[MG:] Long lonely hours we once knew
[KW:] We have each other & live what life's worth
[MG:] All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth

[repeat & fade]
[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
