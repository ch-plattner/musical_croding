Time...Time...
Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
Time...Time...Time...Time
But we have to live right to get the time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Please, Time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
I let temptation get me off of my groove
Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind, yeah
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Pretty good lovin', oh
Get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right -- good lovin', oh
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right -- good love
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right, baby
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right

(Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock --
My life's a clock and it's winding down)

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight ho's
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight ho's
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground
