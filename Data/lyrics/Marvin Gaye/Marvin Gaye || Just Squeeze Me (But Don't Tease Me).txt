[MG:] Treat me sweet & gentle when you say good night
Squeeze me; please don't tease me
[MW:] I get sentimental whenever you hold me tight
So squeeze me, but please don't tease me

[Bridge:]
[MG:] Missin' you since you went away
Singin' the blues each day
Countin' the nights waitin' for you
[MW:] I want you to know
I never knew I'd love you so
Please say you love me too
[MG:] When I get this feelin', I'm in ecstasy
Squeeze me, please don't tease me

[MG:] Squeeze me, don't tease me

[MW:] Mmm squeeze me, baby don't you tease me

[repeat bridge]

[MW:] Squeeze me, but don't tease me, yeah
[MG:] Mmm squeeze me, ah don't you tease me
[MW:] Don't tease me, Marvin. Just squeeze me... 
[fade]
