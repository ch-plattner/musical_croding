Said the world's situation should be rated X, yeah rated X
Listen people, let only in the movie show
Take a look outside, I swear the truth is really told
It's life in living color; fighting, killing, drug-dealing, it's everywhere
What about the crime? Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see its making
What happened to God's creations?
The one thing that really bothers me the most
Is how we come, how we take the lives of the fold
The world today is in a grave situation
Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair

Na na na... Oh I know something's missing all over the world
Ooo, rated X (several times over sax solo)
Oh I know something's missing all over the world

The world's situation should be rated X, rated X
The world's situation should be rated X, rated X
What about the crime? Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see its making
What happened to God's creations?
Where're the wars, where's the peace?
Where's the joy, where's the woe for us all?
Love is kneelin', rated X
Hate is overweight, rated X
[...and fade]
