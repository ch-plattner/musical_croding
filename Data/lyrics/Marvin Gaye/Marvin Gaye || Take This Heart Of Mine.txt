
Ooo, you say you're feelin' bad 'cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely

[Chorus:]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

[Chorus]

Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
To have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
It'll be the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (one more time, let's hold)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose

[Repeat chorus and fade]
