Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when youre in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

I never regret the years that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe Im a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, its grand
They just dont understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you
