
World, I'm not the same.
I can't remember my name half the time.
I took a walk - I thought I'd get some air -
but was really not aware of what I said or what I did.
I never see the dark of night or the light of day.
I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play.
Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me.
I'm flirting with the mother of insanity.
Oh, babe, where is my mind?
Since you left me it's been hard to find.
Oh where, where is my mind?
It started to rain, and I felt insane,
but one thing's for sure:
It's going to rain forever more
until you come back to me.
Please, babe...

World, I'm not the same.
I go somewhere and can't remember how I came.
I'm completely turned around, lost in space.
It's your face I see constantly.
I never know from right or wrong, or anything.
I'm like a desperate man,
just see me try to cling
to the only other parts you've left to me.
I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty.
Oh, bring back my mind.
Since you left me, honey,
I can't find it.
Oooh, honey, bring back my mind.
I'm starting to say
more and more every day.
Please release my soul.
Give me back control of my mind.
Only you can save me.
