
Suddenly a stranger entered my life
Like I pictured her to be
Started my emotions running free
Oh, just like the waters in the sea

As she looked at me with a smile so sincere
My heart started to sing in a voice, I'm sure she could hear
I reached out for a tender loving kiss
Only to find my love didn't even exist, oh baby

I then realized it was just a dream
The candlelight burning such a radiant beam
Oh how I yearned for this dream to come true
For just one exciting moment with someone like you

But as I sat there with tears falling from my eyes
I seemed to dream a thousand and one sighs
Yeah, hope was passing by with a slow unhappy pace
And all there was for me was the bitterest taste

Oh baby, stranger in my life, surely it was
Stranger in my life, oh baby

But as I sat there, tears falling from my eyes
The stranger in my life reached out
Honey reached out for me
And opened my world of loneliness with a magical kiss

Stranger in my life, tell you she's so fine
Stranger in my life, she's wonderful
Stranger in my life, telling you she's fine
Stranger in my life
