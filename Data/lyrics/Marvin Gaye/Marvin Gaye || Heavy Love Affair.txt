
Look in your eyes
And I see the lies
But in my mind
It's a mystery
Feeling the pain
And I feel the love
And once again
You're the world to me

Hey, what is this thing I'm feeling, baby
What are these strange emotions
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply

It's almost midnight
And my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town

(Very special love
Very special love affair)

You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love & a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And my soul's on fire
Looking for love & a girl for me

Memories of our love obsesses me

If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine
