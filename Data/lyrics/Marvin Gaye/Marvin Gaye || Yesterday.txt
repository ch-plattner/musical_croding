
Oh, yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
People I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly

Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say

I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

Oh, talkin' about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

Well I must have said something wrong
Now I long, long for yesterday

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in, I want you to know I believe in
Yester, yester, yesterday
