I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California right away
Just to see the evening sun setting in the west
Breaks my heart, reminds me of the true love that I left
In the sunset I can see my baby's face just haunting me
Reminding me of the tenderness that heaven knows was in her kiss
I had a love that was mine mine mine mine alone
But I played the fool and Lord I left my happy home
What a fool a man can be, but this loneliness inside of me says
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California

I wish I was there by my baby's side
Lord I wish I had listened to my heart and not my pride
She tried to tell me that I had no reason to tell her she was...
I was blinded by my pride and I just couldn't see
Now I've got to hurry, I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move, true love I'm gonna lose
I pray it's not too late, oh I might have to catch a freight
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California right away

Ohhhhh may have to hitchhike baby
Might have to hop a freight
Yea yeah now I've got to hurry
Now I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move
Or true love I'm gonna lose
What a fool a man can be
But this loneliness inside of me says
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California

Might have to hitchhike, baby
Might have to hitch a ride
Oh now now I got to get to California
