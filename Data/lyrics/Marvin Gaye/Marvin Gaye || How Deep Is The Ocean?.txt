
how much do i love you?
i'll tell you no lie
how deep is the ocean?
how high is the sky?

how many times a day do i think of you?
how many roses are sprinkled with dew?
how far would i travel to be where you are
how far is the journey from here to a star?

and if i left you, how much would i cry?
how deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?
