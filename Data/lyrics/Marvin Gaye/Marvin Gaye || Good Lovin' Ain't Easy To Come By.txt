[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
[Him:] Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
[Her:] 'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
[Both:] Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
[Him:] I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
[Her:] But at last you'll find out that don't compare
[Both:] To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Both:] It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
[Him:] If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
[Her:] We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
[Him:] Oh baby, let's do it today
[Her:] Inflection
[Both:] Give us protection

[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
[Him:] Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
[Her:] But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
[Both:] That's what we've got

[Fading sequence:]
[Her:] Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
over [Him:] Oh, oh, it ain't easy
