
When the dawn comes over the mountain
And when the valley is filled with dew
Don't worry, baby, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

When the moon rises to kiss the stars above
And when it sets deep in the blue
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm home, I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

Don't worry about me
I still care
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Don't worry about me, baby
'Cause I'll be there
(Don't worry, baby, don't worry)

I still love you and I always will
Till my life is over, baby, baby
Till time stand still
Till time stand still

Don't worry about me
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I'll still love you, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Don't worry about me, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I'm gonna stick right by your side, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

I said don't, don't, don't
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Don't worry about me
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Baby, don't cha worry, ain't goin' to worry
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Because I, I, I, I, I
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I still love you baby, I love you baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

I said, no, no, no, no, no
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
