
I'll never forget you, baby

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes and see
All the wonderful things you are to me

A wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joy love can bring
I 'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile
