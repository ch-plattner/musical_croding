[starting with rapping some credits]

I'm coming straight for your love baby
Like a rocket girl
Been so long
I'm making plans to get back to you
Still I'm wondering what to do
Seems so long yeah
I'll make it up to you
Like a rocket girl
I miss you baby

[Chorus:]
[B.G.] Miss your love
[Lead] And I miss your mind
[B.G.] And your body
[Lead] We had so much love
[B.G.] Love to give
[Lead] I need to love your body
[B.G.] Love your body
Here we are
[Lead] In and out of love

I hope we're learning to fall in love anew
Girl I know, yeah
I know your tender lovin' that's why I want you
I need you lovin', yeah
Need your love
And I miss your mind and your body
We had so much love
Love to give
I need to love your body
Love your body

Seems so long
Since you were in my arms
I need to rock you
And hold you all night long
I'm so happy to spend this time with you
So very happy that we might start anew

[Chorus]

Love your soul baby
Love your soul baby
My love is waiting for you
I want to love you again
I need you again

My love,
I want to love you again
I need you again
Been so long
Making all my plans to get back to you
What I'm gonna do?
It seems so long, but I'll make it up to you
Like an IBM and a rocket girl

[Chorus]

When I make you mine, I'll be fine
My love is waiting for you
[Vamp & Fade]
