I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you
And you're were long ment for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight

Je t'aime toi
Pour raisons sentimentales
J'espere que tu me crois
Je t'ai donne mon coeur

I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
