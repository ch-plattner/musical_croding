Light years ahead
You and me gon be getting down
On a space bed
We gon get married in June
We gon be getting down on the moon
Light years, interplanetary funk

Still getting down

Music won't have no race
Only space, Peaceful space
There is time what a trip
Step inside my little ship
I can tell by your way
That you really wanna stay
In space, funky space
Peaceful space
Terrible place

Get in this here machine

Alright everybody, we're moving now to come in for a landing here in Pluto
