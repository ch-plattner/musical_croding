
You've been a long time coming
But darlin', welcome home
You've been a long time coming
But darlin', welcome home

So many nights I've called your name
Not knowing if I'd see you again
You've been a long time coming
But, oh, baby, welcome home

Feel, feel kinda, kinda, kinda good right now
Feel so good baby, yeah
You've been a long, real long time coming
But darlin', welcome home

You've been a long, long, long time coming
Oh, baby, welcome home

So many nights, I sit lookin' at the wall
Hoping, praying for your call
You've been a long, long time coming
But oh, baby, welcome home

Feel kinda good, so good right now
Feel so good, baby, yeah
Ha, feel so good having you home, baby
Yeah, yeah, ooh, don't ever leave me
