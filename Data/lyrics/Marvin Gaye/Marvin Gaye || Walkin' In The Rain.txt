
Ooh, walkin' in the rain
Is insane
Can't explain
How i feel when I'm walkin' in the rain with you

It rains in my hair
But I don't seem to care
Just as long
As you're walkin' with me, too

It rains as we walk
We get sunny weather
We stop and we talk
Then we get wet together

Rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you ever go

Oh, now rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you, should you ever go
