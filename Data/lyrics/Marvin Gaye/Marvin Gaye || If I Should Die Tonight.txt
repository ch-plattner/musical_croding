Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
'Cause I've known you

Oooh, oh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream
Oh, how many arms
Have felt their dream
How many hearts, baby...
Have felt their world stand still

Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will

If I should die tonight love
Darlin', though it be far before my time
I won't die blue
'Cause I've known you

Oooh, oh, I'm thankful that you're lovin' me
My one desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here and never tired
Love has been so good to me
I'm so thankful

Oooh, oh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream
How many arms
Have felt their dream
How many hearts, oh darlin'
Have felt their world stand still
Oh Lord!

Millions never, no, never
And millions never will, sugar
They never will

If I should die tonight, ahhh baby
I just want you to keep this thought in mind
That I would never die blue...
'Cause I've known you
Oooh!!
