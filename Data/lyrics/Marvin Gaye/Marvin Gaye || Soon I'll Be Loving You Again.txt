
Dreamed of you this morning,
Then came the dawn and ,
I thought that you were here with me,
If you could only see how much I love you,
You'd wanna trust me
Oh in my dream I was loving you
Every place that you wanted me to
Since I believe in dreams and fantasies and things
I want to make love to you right now baby
hooo, I got a real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passion flowing like wine
Baby, baby please let me do it to you
(Although) I never gave up no head before
but there's always the first you know
So I made up my mind soon I'll be loving you
That's all --I've rested up baby, I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving, girl I know what I'm gonna do
I can't wait to touch you
and give you that feelin'
eat you up my dear
so that your mood will be revealed, and
Baby, and soon as I know I've got you willin'
I'm gonna give you some head baby

Soon, I'm gonna let you get it, cause I know just what to do with it
