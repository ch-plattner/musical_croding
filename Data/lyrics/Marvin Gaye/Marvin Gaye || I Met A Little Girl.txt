
I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home and ahh made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think i'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you, all the heartaches you hid

Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you

Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
'Cause I love you

1964

Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you

1976

Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today, today
If you're a friend of mine

Cry cry cyr-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Dou you think about the kind of love we had?

Hal le hallelejah
Hal le lu i'm free
Hal le hallelejah
Hal le lu i'm free
[crying and fade]
