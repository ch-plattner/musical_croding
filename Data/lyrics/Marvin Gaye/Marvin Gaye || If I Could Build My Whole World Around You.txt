[M:]
If I could build my whole world around you, darlin'
First I'd put heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky
And I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have the whole world built around you
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

[T:]
If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
I'd put joy where there's never been love
And I'd give my love to you
To keep for the rest of your life
And happiness would surely be ours
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

[Both:] Doo doo doo doo...

[M:] Oh, if I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess
[T:] And I'd step into this world you've created
And give you true love and tenderness
And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by

[Repeat and fade:]
[M:] If I could build my whole world around you
[T:] If I could build my whole world around you
[Both:] Then that would be all right, oh yeah
