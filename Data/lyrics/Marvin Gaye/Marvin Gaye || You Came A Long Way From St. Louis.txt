
You came a long way from St. Louis,
you climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars
that were parked out in front of your fancy address.

You came a long way from St. Louis,
you broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals
who were doing alright till you came on the scene.

You came here from the middle west,
and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.
Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So natcherly I got my doubts, you got `em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.

You came a long way from St. Louis,
but baby, you still got a long way to go.
