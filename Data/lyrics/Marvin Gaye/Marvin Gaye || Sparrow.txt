
I used to hear a sparrow singing, baby
Oh, but one day as I went along I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing?

Sing to me, oh, sparrow come around
Come around, why don't you come around?
Sing about melody, aww, melody
About the things you see
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out now, sing it on out

Let the world know what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me?

And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know
Every time I'm feeling low
I know I can always count on you
Sing, little sparrow
About the troubles you're in, places you've been
You can sing I know it, don't you try to pretend

Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song

Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you see me sucking up the lay?
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God and love
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing

Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing

Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow

Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song

Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird
