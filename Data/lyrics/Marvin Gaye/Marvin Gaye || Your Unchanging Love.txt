[Chorus:]
I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)
To your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now

Darlin', there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than paintin' the town
Only noon and night
'Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Chorus]

I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
'Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darlin', I'm tired of runnin' 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
'Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

[Chorus]

Darlin', everybody need somebody, ooo I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing:
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why...

[Repeat chorus and fade]
