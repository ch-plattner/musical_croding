I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's 
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe 
Understanding my condition 
I must surely be a wishing 
and a hoping to be free

Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly

Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
Begun to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I think I minded
See I've finded
I think I've stimulated
That after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife

Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you 
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She would try to put me down, she used to bully
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song and dance around
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mr. man, what's going down

That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
I come to love you fool
I come to love you baby
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah

I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it

You tried to have them shut me
Bring me
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
But Mommy's worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Being trying to sell my
Oh I tried to communicate
Tryina set my woman
Salmon in my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Put a lot to work
Wish it was in a position
To upset the judge

You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you

You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
