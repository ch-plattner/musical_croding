[MG:] Love woke me up this morning feelin' fine
I had you on my mind, oh oh
Love woke me up this morning
& I haven't had a heartache today, darlin'
All my little tears are gone away
Skies are blue because I have you, I love you

[TT:] Love woke me up this morning, oh yes indeed
Thinkin' of last night
You know, you made me feel all right, oh
Love woke me up this morning
I'm so glad, yes I am
[BOTH:] Because of you, happiness is mine
All my cloudy days are all behind

[TT:] Baby, every place I see your face
[MG:] & now I smile, you made my life worthwhile
[TT:] Yes you did
[BOTH (repeat & fade):]
I haven't had a heartache today
& all my little tears are gone away
Because of you, happiness is mine
& all my cloudy days are all behind
