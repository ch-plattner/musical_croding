
Oh my love if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
[MG:] To you, 
[TT:] You

[BOTH:] Have a little faith, just a little faith 
In me & I will do 
The things I should for you 
Give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
[MG:] To you, 
[TT:] You

[MG:] I know I've strayed far far away from your arms 
Yeah baby, just like a fool 
[TT:] I hope & I pray that you'll let me return 
So I can make love, make love, make love to only you

[BOTH:] Oh my love, if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
[MG:] To you, 
[TT:] You

[BOTH:] Have a little faith, just a little faith 
In me & I will do 
Give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through
