[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true
[T:] Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do
[M:] Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere
[T:] Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
[M:] And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause like a leaf out on a tree
[M:] You've become a part of me
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[Both:] Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
[M:] Oh Tammi
[T:] What good am I without you
[M:] I can't do without you, darlin'
[Both:] Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
[T:] Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
[M:] No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[...and fade]
