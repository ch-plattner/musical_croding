Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
Now I really went out of my mind
I miss your lovin' when you left, baby you did
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby let us, ah tell me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt long
Ah baby, come get to this

Ooo remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I've been waiting
I'm ready for you to start doin' the things
I'm tryin' to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I've been waiting
Come here, baby, get to this

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
Get back here from the depths, we have to get back
Oh, nothin's changed, you're still sweet as the mornin' rain
Girl, I'm standin' ready to
Love you, babe, make it good to you

Ooo I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this

Girl, I know you've been gone a long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, glad that you call me your baby
Oooo-eeee-oooo
