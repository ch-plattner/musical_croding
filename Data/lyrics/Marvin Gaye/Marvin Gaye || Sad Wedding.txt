
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

We fell in love, first day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say

It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile

We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding

And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears
