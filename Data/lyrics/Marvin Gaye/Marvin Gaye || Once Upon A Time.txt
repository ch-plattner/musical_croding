Once upon a time I almost lost my mind
I was lonely, so lonely
Once upon a time

Hoping every day things would go my way
Then you came into my life
Now everything is fine

I never knew what love could do till I met you
Now everything is oh so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you
I'm so glad; I was lonely
Once upon a time
