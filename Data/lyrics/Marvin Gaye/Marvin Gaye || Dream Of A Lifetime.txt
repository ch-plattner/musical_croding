
I have tasted success
I've been in love more or less
With a dream that will last me
A lifetime, baby

Other dreams, I have lost
But whatever the cost
The parade isn't passing me by
No, no, no, no, no, darling

So if the picture I paint
Makes me a sinner, or makes me a saint
I won't try, no, not I
To deny it, woo, oh

I may cry with the past
But it's easier to laugh about it
When I think of my wonderful life
I thank God for my wonderful life
