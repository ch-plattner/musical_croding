
Just like music
Ooh, oh baby

To relax my mind so I can be free
And absorb the sound that keep me round
Doing my thing constantly with no worries
Peace to Keith Murray

To keep me flowing and keep me going
And keep me growing
To keep me from the E from knowing
What happens out there is not my concern
You wanna die, it's not my turn

To do something to me, like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway doing over 80
Without music baby (Ow, I'll go crazy) yeah

Make me call my homie on the phone
Like there's something new out that got me in the zone
Just that feeling got me
I wish music could adopt me

Turn on some music
I got my music

Put me in the mood with my woman
Got me in the ear singin' sweet nothings
Make love come out of the mouth, no frontin'
Like all of a sudden

Taking away your worries and cares
Any problems music will be right there
Together match, yo we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin? (Yeah, music)

Yo to get you to bang this
Body soul snatcher, universal language
It be the light, so open up
This is it, what the fuck?

One fly tune to have black and white vibe in one room
No confrontation, probably all night
It's just the sensation

Just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
And music makes the clouds go by baby
Your music keeps my tears inside my eyes

Your music makes me want to sing
Girl, music is a joy to bring

Music is my heart and soul
More precious than gold
Happiness today is just a song away
I love your music baby
