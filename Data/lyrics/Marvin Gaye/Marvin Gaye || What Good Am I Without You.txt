[Both:]
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Her:]
What good would a rose be if the raindrops didn't fall?
What good is a telephone if there's no one to call?
What good is a wedding if no one says "I do"?
Tell me, baby what good am I without you?

[Both:]
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Him:]
What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?
What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?
Tell me, what good is a sweetheart who proves to be untrue?
What good, baby, am I without you?

[Him:] I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know
[Her:] I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so
[Him:] What good is living without the one you love?
[Her:] And what good is the heavens without the stars above?
[Him:] What good is a true heart that proves to be broken in two?
[Both:] [Repeat and fade:] What good, baby, am I without you?
