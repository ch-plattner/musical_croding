[MW:] I used to be so fancy free
But really lonesome as could be
Till one lucky day you came my way, Marvin
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MG:] I used to think there'd never be
A girl who'd ever care for me
But what do you know? You made it so
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MW:] When you kissed me I felt the seasons change
From winter to spring
[MG:] Ooo when you kissed me, I lost my reason
'Cause I heard the birds sing; I felt like a king
[MW:] Now I have to rub my eyes
Each time I try to realize
That your love is mine, ain't it just fine?
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MG:] I used to be fancy free
Really lonesome as can be
Till one lucky day you came my way
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you, baby yeah

[MW:] I used to think there'd never be
A boy who'd ever care for me
But what do you know? You made it so
I never knew what love was all about, baby
Until I met you

[MG:] When you kissed me I felt the seasons change
From winter to spring, yeah
[MW:] When you kissed me, I lost my reason
'Cause I heard the birds sing; I felt like a queen
[MG:] Now I've got to rub my eyes
Each time I try to realize
That your love is mine, ain't it just fine?
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you, yeah

[MG:] I never knew, baby, no no
[MW:] I never knew, Marvin, what love was, yeah
[MG:] I'm crying out, baby, yeah yeah
[MW:] We're gonna take it slow, let it go right now, yeah
[fade]
