
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show that you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful

Ev'ry time my little world seems blue
I-I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I wanna say but the right words won't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I wanna say but the right words won't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
Lord!, this world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

Some kind of a soft love
Some kind of a warm love
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful, yes, it is, I-I-I know

[FADE]
Say I know
