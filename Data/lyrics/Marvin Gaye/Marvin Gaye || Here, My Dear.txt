
I guess I'd have to say this album is
dedicated to you.
Although perhaps you may not be happy,
this is what you want,
so I conceded.
I hope it makes you happy.
There's a lot of truth in it, babe.

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
to keep me in line.
One thing I can't do without
is the boy whom God gave to both of us.
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.

So here it is, babe.
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,
think about the kisses and the joy.
But there were those other moments too,
the times that were cloudy and grey.
Bad.
But you taught me that was life.
May love ever protect you,
may peace come into your life.
Always think of me the way I was.
Ha, I was your baby.

This is what you wanted.
Here, dear, here it is.
Here, my dear, here it is.
