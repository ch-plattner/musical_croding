Forever my darling our love will be true
Always and forever I'll love just you
Just promise me darling your love in return
Make this fire in my soul forever burn

Forever my darling our love will be true
Always and forever I'll love just you
Just promise me darling your love in return
Make this fire in my soul, dear, forever burn

My heart's at your command, dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal

And I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving ways
No I'll never part from you
And your loving ways
And I'll never part from you
And your loving ways

Yes, forever my darling
I won't love nobody but you
Give me love in return
