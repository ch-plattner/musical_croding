
To me you're extra special mellow
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good
So when you say you love me, I really believe you, girl
For it's what you say and what you really do

Oh, you've got to understand, darling
The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
The world is not for long
(Got to pray and meditate)

There's only time for singing and praying
(We don't have the time to waste)
And having a love party
(Got to pray and meditate)

Go check out the times, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
What we need is a love explosion
(Got to pray and meditate)

We don't have no time to waste
(We don't have the time to waste)
Got to pray and meditate
(Got to pray and meditate)

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins
(Oh yeah)

To me you're really extra special mellow, baby
Oh, and the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
So when you say you love me, I believe you, baby
And it's good to party, fun to party with you, baby

To me you're extra special mellow, baby
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
Mmm, so when the party's over
Let's go create some loving, baby

Whoa, no time, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Fooling around, let there be peace and love
(Got to pray and meditate)

Oh baby, come here, come here, come here, darling
Oh, we need love
(Got to pray and meditate)
Love explosion, oh darling

Mmm, come here, come here, come here, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
