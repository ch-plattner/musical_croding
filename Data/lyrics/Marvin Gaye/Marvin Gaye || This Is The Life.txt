This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, you're there.
This is the life,
You've waited long enough,
Man, you've arrived,
Breathe in that air.
Modern perfume,
Silver and candlelight,
Children, make way,
Joe's here to stay.
Come join the club,
Hear that sweet music start,
This is the life, sweetheart.

Tell them bye-bye,
Get where the action is,
Come have some fun,
I'll lead the way.
This is the life,
They've kept you in a box,
Break down the walls,
Come out and play.
See all the lights,
They're spelling "Wellington,"
How sweet the song
When you belong.
Top of the heap,
That's how it's got to be,
This is the life, you'll see.

This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, I'm there.
This is for me,
Free, black and twenty-one,
Now Ive arrived,
Breathe in that air.
This lovely life,
This groovy atmosphere,
Out of my way,
Joe's here to stay.
King of the hill,
That's how it's got to be,
This is the life for me.
