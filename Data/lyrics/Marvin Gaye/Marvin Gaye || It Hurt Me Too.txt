
I could have left and said I told you so
(Told you so)
I could have told the whole wide world and leave you sad and blue
(Sad and blue)

Said I could have left and said it's good for you, yeah now
But I know when it hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

I could have said that you had it coming to you
(Coming to you)
When you walked out and turned your back on me
(Back on me)

I played it, baby, all along, please, please baby, don't go
'Cause I knew he would hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

He said he had you dancing on a string
As far as love goes, you were just another fling
Oh, I may be a fool to love you the way I do
(Way I do)

Don't you realize even fools have feeling too
So baby, come on back
And let me dry the tears from your eyes

'Cause I would never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
No, no I'd never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
'Cause baby when he hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

It hurts me so bad
(Hurt me too)
I'd never desert you
(Hurt me too)
