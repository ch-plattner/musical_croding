
Every little kiss you give to me I'll store in my memory chest
Even all the tears I shed will be there along with your warm caress

Oh darling, there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest just for me

Every letter that you write to me I'll store in my memory chest
Oh Tammi, so I can look back and read the words and I'll reminisce

I'm not sayin' that you're going to leave me
But there's one thing I do believe, it's possible, you see
Baby, I'm gonna store them away in my memory chest just for me

In my memory chest, baby, sweet sweet memories, baby
Every kiss, each caress, all your love and tenderness
In my memory chest, baby

You promised me that our love would last till the end of time
Just in case you see another girl that can change your mind

Every happy moment I spend with you I'll store in my memory chest
Oh baby, you have filled my life, my life with much love and tenderness

Oh darlin', there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest, every little thing

Baby, gonna [?] in my memory chest
Every letter, baby
Ooh, yes I will darlin'
Just for me

Just for me
Oh darling, just for me, baby
Baby, baby, just for me
