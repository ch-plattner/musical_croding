Say, baby
you know I want you
to let your light come shining through
aww, baby
baby, why don't you
just let your light come shining through
baby
no need to worry
let your love come shining through
honey
when in trouble
let your love come shining through
ohh, baby
you'll be happy
when your light come shining through
baby
life is a party
let your love come shining through

let it shine, baby
let it shine, baby
let it shine, baby
let it shine, baby
shine all the time
shine and be kind
then you'll feel fine
then you'll be mine

baby
life is worth living
if you let your love come shining through
aww, baby
the world is mellow
when you let your love come shining through

mmmm, baby
you look so pretty while you dancin', baby
shining
look so pretty, shining, shining
give it to me, shining, shining
look so pretty, shining
oh, baby
let your love come shining through
oh, darling
let your light come shining through
ooh, baby
the world is waiting
so let your light come shining through
Stevie
we really dig you
hope you don't mind this riff from you

ohh, praise Him when you go to work
praise Him when your feelings hurt
praise Him when you're feeling bad
praise Him when you're feeling sad
all praises to the power
praise Him by the love you give
praise Him by the way you live
praise Him even when you dance & make romance
when you make romance
(let your light come shining through, BABY!)
praise Him when you got no time
praise Him whether rain or shine (shine shine shine shine shine)
praise Him for the sunlighted sky
praise Him for the moonlight
