Now We're makin' love
Now We're makin' love
Now We're makin' love
Where'd you get such sweet sugar

I'll be lovin' you day and night
In and out, wrong or right
'Cause I want you, baby , for my wife
Oh girl, you're so divine
You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything that's on my mind
Is it real

That we're makin' love
That we're makin' love
That we're makin' love
Oh my my my my my

Keep right on kissing me
When I'm kissing you
I know you know
What this is leading to
You know real soon, baby

I'll be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around
I love to hear you make those sound
I'm gonna be lovin' you in and out
Up and down, all around
'Cause I love to hear you
Make those sounds
I'm gonna be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around
I love to hear you, baby
Make those sounds
I'm taking you hear and there
And all around the world
I love you hear you, girl
Make those sounds
