Father stop, criticizin' your son
Mother please, leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world, with the world today

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

We all talked of kindness
But it's only, only a word, truly
Brother turn on a sister
In this cruel, cruel world

That's what's wrong
With oh, in this world today

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

Somebody to play with
Wanna mold you, wanna mold you
Shape you like they wanna
Wanna  to do their thing

Children are told, to give not just to take
If we were all children, 
You know the world
Will be a better place, oh

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
We should all love each other
Love and take one another
We should all love each other
Love and not hate, oh

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

True everybody wants somebody
To mold them, shape them own way
Everybody wants somebody
Try to make it
Or do their, do their thing

Everybody wants takes somebody
Got to make it do their thing
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

Everybody wants somebody, somebody
To be their own piece of clay
