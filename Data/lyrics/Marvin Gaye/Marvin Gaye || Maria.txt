The most beautiful sound I've ever heard
Maria, oh, Maria
All of the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word
Maria, I love you, Maria
Maria
Maria
I've just met a girl named Maria
& suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be
Maria
I've just kissed a girl named Maria
& suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be
Maria
Say it loud & there's music playing
Say it soft & it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
Maria, beautiful, wonderful
Maria, sweet Maria
Maria
Maria
Maria!
Say it loud & there's music playing
Say it soft & it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
All of the beautiful sounds I've ever heard
Maria
Maria
