
Once upon a time, when you and me live in infinity
There were two of us, a God of love and a God of evil
Something about polarity - you know, day and night
Black and white, hot and cold, wrong and right, life and death
Polarity, without the opposite we could never be
Now this is all-knowing entity of good and evil
Decided that the place was awfully lonely
So they decided that they would create a world
Of insects and flowers and animals and birds and life untold
Worlds within a world of good things for the good
And evil things for the evil, and there was jealousy

Now comes man
Devil wanted to have all the control
But the Good Lord said,
"We gonna have to share equally in this here human soul
But we will give man understanding and reason to decide
Whether to join a God of love and peace
Or burn in your eternal fire"
Lord, have mercy and stay with me
Good God said, "I really, I really want to
Love 'em and give 'em all the things that they desire
And bless 'em and love 'em so much and
I got to give 'em reason 'cause I want 'em to come back to me
When the power of evil is all gone"

Whoa, some souls are ready to rejoin the Lord of love
Did you ever wonder why a little baby cry when he's born
His soul isn't happy 'cause we got to give up all the sin
But we coming a-home my friend until the soul is ready to be Spirit again
Good Lord don't mind, when you're ready He'll be ready
'Cause time don't mean a thing to these Lords
The Evil Lord don't mind if you're not ready
He wants you to bring your soul to him
It's a power struggle, my friend
A Buddhist monk can burn his body without a flinch
I think he's ready

The Evil Lord tempts a man with the things
Heart and the soul and the flesh
That you put on him and desire, to keep him from you:
"I don’t think you shoulda did right, you give him too much power,
I'll make him destroy all we created - weak and foolish, baby”
And the Good Lord said, "No, no, I know know know,
Mankind can feel my love"
And the Evil Lord said,
"No, no, no, no, no, no, I want 'em all
You shouldn't have gave him reason,
You shouldn't have gave him reason"
'Cause we are the soul to the mind
And the mind to the brain and the brain to the body,
Get what the soul desires
And Evil said,
"I got what the soul desires for mankind's flesh
Having fun, and uh, I know what they like and
I'm gonna put it on 'em, baby,
'Cause your body's really nothing now 
But a safe for the soul”

And then the Good Lord says,
"You can listen to me, I'm in your soul
Your decision is free
I gave you reason, don't you wanna be with me, do right?"
Walk in the light, I love, baby
