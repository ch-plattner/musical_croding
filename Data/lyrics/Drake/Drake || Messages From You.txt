
I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did, ohhh
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A.
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me
Ohhh, that's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh...

I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you too
