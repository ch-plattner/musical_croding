Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t–

Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep egging me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
No offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound
That'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man

That’s why I don’t read the news, it’s garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, he’s garbage
Got guys on my back about schedule, saying it’s too tough
Well guess what?
It’s Division-1 football!
It’s the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didn’t ya?
Go play intramurals, brother
Go play intramurals
