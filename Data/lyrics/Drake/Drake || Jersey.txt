[Future:]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip got a whole lot of 30
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like we love wearin' jerseys
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it

[Future:]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us

[Future:]
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out the Bentley and roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I'm keepin' the bank, I'm like Bird
Sip out my cup and it's dirty

You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it

[Future:]
I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make some more money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I got a main ting, that's a period
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us
