[Lil Wayne:]
Yeah uh huh um uh huh
Hello motherfucker hey hi how ya do'ern?
It's weezy f baby come to take a shit and urine on the toilet bowl bitches pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucker sigma
Bad to the bristle
Hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
bitch named crystal
Let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth
And then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me
You probably never will
Riders rollin' with me like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin'
Kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus:]
I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]
Bitch I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]

[Drake:]
First off you know what it is if you heard drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earth quake
Never see me out cause I live in my work place
I give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you can never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist
No bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga
I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though
I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I ain't never met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm going in to buck you when the hook drops

[Chorus:]
I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]
Bitch I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]

[Young Jeezy:]
Hold up wait one motherfucking minute
Its the El capitan I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said I'm going in then I motherfucking meant it
An if I brought in the club then Imma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands an I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room cause you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not but she know she fucking wit it
She said she seen it all I said "No you fucking didn't!!!!"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a two seater!?
She said "I can't feel my legs" I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm going in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know maybe where my blunt ends
An Imma be a legend even when my life ends
An Imma be a legend even when this night ends
Til I do my thang, hop up out it like biem
Bitch I said I'm in so I'm nothing like them

[Chorus:]
I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]
Bitch I'm going in [x4]
And I'ma go hard [x4]
