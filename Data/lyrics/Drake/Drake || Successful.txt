I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

[Drake:]
Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear,
A lot of you all still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Shape the lines in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.

[Drake:]
Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So it's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

[Drake:]
Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is

[Trey Songz:]

I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you

[Lil Wayne:]
Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby I go real hard
No further details boy.
