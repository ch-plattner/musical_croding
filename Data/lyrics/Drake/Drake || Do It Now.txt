[Verse 1:]
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,
lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this...yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,
and she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.

ayo, ayo, ayo....[repeat 4x]

[Verse 2:]
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,
clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are costin, girl...
and maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.
