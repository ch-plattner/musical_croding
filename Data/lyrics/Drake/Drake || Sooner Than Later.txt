
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear your the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
(All you ever asked me for was time, whoa)

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited to long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]

The girl or the world you see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good in all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good in being famous if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallen, light's glowing and I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort of my ice showing
And I'm not tryna be without you at the right moment nigga nice going
Is it worth it that decision because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants cause I better look good girl if this my chance I swear

So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited to long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]
