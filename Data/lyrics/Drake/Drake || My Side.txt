
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it down

Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man

Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

You don't ever come to where I stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situation get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man
