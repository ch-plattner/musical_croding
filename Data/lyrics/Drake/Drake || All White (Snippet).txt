[Drake:]
Thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm a bout to talk a blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women are you here?
Are you here right now? Huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look your getting all your friends, and your getting in your car
And you're coming to the house, are we clear right now, huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things, niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka'
New floors, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some steps, let' just fuck each other
Talking filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Tyga:]
Ooh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep coming with the bank number
Downplay the money
I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her you know I get that a lot
Coke game, like a night game
At the rave, cocaine, came with the scale mane
Tryna be the only one, that's a lone race
I call you Billy Jean, but what would Mike say
In LA, in LA, we at the mansion, all day
In MIA, all the girls with it
Yeah, late night they say don't stop, get it, get it
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like why home
No shades, I bring it to your face nigga
Yeah, like what you say, what you say nigga
