
I'm more than just an option
(Hey hey hey)
Refuse to be forgotten
(Hey hey hey)
I took a chance with my heart
(Hey hey hey)
And I feel it taking over

I'd better find your lovin
I'd better find your heart. [x3]
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number
(Hey hey hey)
I doubt you'll find another
(Hey hey hey)
So every single summer
(Hey hey hey)
I be the one that you remember

And I'd better find your lovin
I'd better find your heart. [x3]
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission
(Hey hey hey)
You hear but you don't listen
(Hey hey hey)
You better pay attention
(Hey hey hey)
And give what you've been missin'

I'd better find your lovin
I'd better find your heart. [x3]
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times
I've been wrong
I guess being right
Takes too long
I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I'd better find your lovin
I'd better find your heart
I'd better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothings gonna tear us apart. [x2]
