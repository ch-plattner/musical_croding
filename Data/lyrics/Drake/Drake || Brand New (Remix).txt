This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with

Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and dumb

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
This why I gotta ask, is 

Anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl

[Lil Wayne]
This here is on some remix shit
It seems like everything I do they're leakin it
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin wit

Thats when I gotta hide who I got in the ride
So she still thinks I'm confident and down

How long will this last
My life is on a pedestal am I movin to fast
It feels like I am in crazy competition wit my past
Thats why I gotta ask. . . .

Is anything I'm doin brand new
Brand new
Brand new
Brand new
Brand new

Is anything I'm doin brand new
Brand new
Brand new
Brand new
Brand new

Remix baby. .

If he can do good, then I can do better
Now baby any man would if he would know better
I don't wanna hear about him anymore
And I know you've heard this song before

Is anything I'm doin brand new?. . . 

Brand new

Show me if this is brand new
Brand new

Brand new

This is the remix baby
Weezy baby drazzy
