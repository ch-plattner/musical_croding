[The Weeknd]
You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

[Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap clap, let ‘em fall slow
I know you had your fears you can let them all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple “I think that we’re ready’s”
Couple “I think we should wait’s”
Are we acting like a couple, I’m just trying to get it straight
‘Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
You had to change up the game
Oh the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
I can’t stand the rain in July, (oh July)
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)
But now it’s getting colder
The leaves are turning colors
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed all the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused, tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you so long
I was planning on this being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

[The Weeknd]
Take it off, I want it all
Cause I know what you’re feeling!
It’s OK, girl, I feel it too!
Let it be, baby please
I swear, I’m, not like him!
You’ll be good, promise, you’ll be so good!

[Jhene Aiko]
Our summer turned into fall
See its funny ’cause
I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

[Drake]
You were my, you were my, you were my girl (I was your girl)
Should’ve made, should’ve made, should’ve made you my World
Should’ve made you everything to make you happy baby

[Jhene Aiko]
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for
Can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for the shit
Oh, I am Japanese if you please
