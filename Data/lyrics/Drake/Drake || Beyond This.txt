[Chorus]
I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say [x2]

Yeah, normally, it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
'Cause I remember Stacy, she probably hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She say I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her 'Even Photoshop couldn't change me'
But you-you-you You got me open, girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye
No strings attached, your love is so WiFi

[Chorus]
I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say

My freak girl tell me now she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin girls off the bench like a "sixth-man"
I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin the same ol' que step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin green
She a pledge, AKA she was pink and green
I wanna good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmigin
My pimpinship so hard it needs censorship
I'ma chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know I'ma gettin one, the other's gettin away

[Chorus]
I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say
