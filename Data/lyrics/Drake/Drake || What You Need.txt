Do you hold me close.
Do you hold me close by.
Do you hold me close.
Do you hold me close by.

[Verse 1]
I just wanna take you there.
He don't got to go no where.
Does he touch you here like this.
Let me take this wishing from your lips.

And I will love you girl.
The way you need.
Ain't no one gone stop us.
Ain't no one gone stop us. 
And I will give you girl.
What you fein. 
I'm the drug in your vein.
Just fight throught the pain. 

[Chorus]
Hes what you want. [x4]

[Verse 2]
I got everything you want with me.
I do everything he does times three.
And he ain't don't got to go.
I got you on the floor. 
Doing things you'll never thought you'll do.
Baby leave those high heel shoes. 
Cuz I love it when your looking down at me.
And when I'm looking up at you. 
And I don't give damn.
Shawty watch me knock your boots off. 

And I will love you girl.
The way you need.
Ain't no one gone stop us.
Ain't no one gone stop us. 
And I will give you girl.
What you fein. 
I'm the drug in your vein.
Just fight throught the pain.

[Chorus]
