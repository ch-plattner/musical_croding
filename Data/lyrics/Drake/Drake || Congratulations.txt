[Verse 1:]
Black Hearts on my card again
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order in
And tell Gee to put his feet up on the automin
We just up against a bunch of rappers
I go harder then
Damn I'm so catch-trina smarter then
Alot of these niggas swear
The coaches brought the starter in
Yea and I'm the type to tell your daughter things
I float high don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself suicide bars I kill myself Charge it to the game I bill myself
And I don't feel ya'll but I feel myself
Auntie Doe tell em' I deserve a mozeltov
I'm rapping like a Sheppard with the mussel off
I'm next to blow PAUSE
And I can't hear the critics
Talkin over the applause
Yeah I tried to tell em future let em know
Sending haters all my love X and O
I got a black box wear suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's probaly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl riding in your dream car yeah...
And the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
CONGRATULATIONS

[Verse 2:]
So What you want an award or something
I'm at the private airport boarding somethin
I see nothing from a far but I'm far from nothin
Put on your Poker Face
I'll pull ya card if you bluffin
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a Monopoly catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we'll pull ya card
And find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breaking world records
No false start
I don't see ya point
Unless it's gunpoint or somethin
My deal like Weezy first week
One point Somethin
And my verse is gettin stupider
Wayne if your on Mars
Can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar
Know that on to my Nebula
I will break a leg
Break an arm
And a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you can never beat my ass PAUSE
Again DAMMIT ya'll again ya'll
Pretend that we are
Some men that get it on and in
I die before I lose cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll
Then don't bother him
And yes I fucked this game
But I won't father them

[Verse 3:]
It's like these days man I'm booked
And I'm busy Dad named me Drake
Foots named my Drizzy
They try to tell me I'll never be nothing
But a Protege but if you watch the VMA's
There's nothin more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a POPPY
And damn how I get so nice
I done spent it all once
Bout to get rich twice
Surprise party Bitch now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain Snatch Flow they say get it off yo chest
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin I bet
I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office same extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should
Pay Attenion

[Lil Wayne:]

Congratulations it's CRACK

It's Crack Hahaha congratulations
Ladies and Gentlemen
