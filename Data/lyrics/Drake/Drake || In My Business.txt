[Gucci Mane]
I'm so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs,
There's a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby cos I romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
Theres nothing on the God son that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Man they like potato chips I just cant have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I dont like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping,

[Drake - Chorus]
Uh, uh ahhhh,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How how (?) f-ck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

[Chorus]

[Sean Garrett]
Ain't that your girl,
Aint that your money,
Aint you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,
Aint you a gangsta, yeah funny,
You gave em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,
Classic line, b-tches run like buses,
Gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,
She let me get it n-gga,
She aint stupid, go turn up your radio,
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,
I gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O's
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go

[Drake]
Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
PROBLEM IS YOU PROL TELL THAT SH-T TO EVERYBODY,
SO WE HEAR YOU TALKING BOO BUT WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!
