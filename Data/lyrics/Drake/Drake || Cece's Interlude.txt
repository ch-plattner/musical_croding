[Verse 1]
All night I - been staring--can you tell I want you?
Can't be too - wide open--there's nothing I won't do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
Just thought you should 
Know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-whoa-ooh

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Saying I just want what I can't have (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Won't even give me a chance (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
This is serious...Unh

[Verse 2]
I wish I - wasn't famous
I wish I - was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you--crazy

[Chorus]

[Guitar Interlude]

[Repeat 7x] Ho-whoa-oh yeah
