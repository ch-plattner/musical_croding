You know a lot of girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...

[Chorus:]
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best [x4]
You the best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]
I say you the fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

'cause...

[Chorus]

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best [x4]
You the best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]
I say...
You the fuckin' best [x4]
You the best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]

Uhh, ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya
