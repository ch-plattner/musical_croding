[Drake - Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
but I just can't remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing?
oh yeah thats right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now man
and this what I'm do 'til it's over
'til it's over, it's far from over

[Verse 1]
alright, bottles on me
long as someone drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these n'ggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smidoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn't happen any quicker
y'all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer
it wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uhhh,
one thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game
it's just what comes from fame
and I'm ready for that I'm just saying
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
but I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y'all just do not fit the picture
turn your widescreen on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
it's about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody's ever done it like I did it
ahh

[Chorus]
