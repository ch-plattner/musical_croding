[Verse 3: Drake]
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends that you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You love to get to him
