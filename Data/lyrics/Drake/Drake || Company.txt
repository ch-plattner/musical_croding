[Verse 1: Drake]
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift
I see you doin' well, baby
Oh you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything
Hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

[Outro:]
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now
