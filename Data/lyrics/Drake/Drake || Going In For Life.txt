I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before...
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes,
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understands tha fact that I'm spending off shore dough
Cash only transactions, homie,
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they don't know I bought it
I been doin' this for years homie, thoroughly I've thought it
Through, what it do, I am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currency's imported
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mitchkeit as they say he's a legal bender
And ATF is present every legal memeber
The coalition, we so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen,
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in a basement that Rennie Grew was piffin'
When pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And this the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic,
Aside from talkin' 'bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that...
