[Rick Ross:]
Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell a bad bitch girl, let's go hang
You know me, rolex, gold chain
Fuck my young niggas, XO gang
Get so drunk you forget yo name
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back, So I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything that make shit go slow
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us

[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche
It's simple love, it's simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's
MBA accountants, amounts they get unholy
But mama still praying for her rubberband man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled

[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong, OOh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these niggas know it's real, wassup

[Hook:]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
