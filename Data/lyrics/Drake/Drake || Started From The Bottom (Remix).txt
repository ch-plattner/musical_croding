Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1: Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I’mma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in the game, went online and it changes
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…
