You know exactly what you got, and I don't blame you at all...
You can't resist it...
Especially when the lights so bright, and the money so right,
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leaveeeeeeeee,
She just stuck in...

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down, ooooooo

She doesnt ever worry, if she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life, and shes scared of ending up alone

Throw your 1's up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down, oooooo

We all got dreams and we all star reaching, all star peaking, all-star weekend...
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading, never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season,
But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving

Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside get you some water and undress you
I give you my all, and the next morning you'll forget:
Who, or Why, or How, or When
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you...
Although I would be glad to...
I probably go and tattoo... your name on my heart,
I swear
I start,
To think,
That I'm going crazy

Throw your 1'ss up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the 1's you throw will get her out of:

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down, oooooo
