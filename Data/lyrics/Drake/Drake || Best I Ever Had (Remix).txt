[Intro: Drake (Busta Rhymes)]
You know alot of girls be (Drake! Busta Bus! Remix!)
Thinkin my songs are about them
This is not to get confused, this one's for you

[Chorus: Drake (Busta Rhymes)]
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best (Aiyyo Drake!)
You the best I ever, best I ever had
(Aiyyo you make me feel like I need to sit down my woman
 and just talk straight to her nigga!!!)
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Check it! Baby girl! I'm lovin everything about you
And when I'm on these records girl you make me wanna shout you
And when I see you, I always wanna mouth to mouth you
Let's go, to the altar so I could officially spouse you
Baby! I'm glad you let me in to be your dude (Yeah!)
I love your lovin even when your seasonin my food
When shit get ugly, you never let it change the mood
Your always holdin me doooooooooowwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
You know I love you as my lady
Make me wanna fertilize you have a little Busta baby
And have a couple more and let them drive us fuckin crazy
Ane have fun while we chasin them around
(DAMN WE RAISED SOME BAD ASS KIDS GIRL!!!!)
For as long as I am breathin
I'm a rep for you on everything I love and I believe in
And when these other niggas see you they be always schemin
They ain't knowin I am wearin the crown

[Chorus: Drake]
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best

[Verse 2: Drake]
(Sex, Love, Pain) baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I coul pro'lly sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the iss-ue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiiiis-tle
Like the Andy Griffith them song
...And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in ya slot 'till the nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin...

[Chorus: Drake]
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best,  you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best

[Outro: Drake]
Uh! Ah yeah! See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah, you know who you are...
