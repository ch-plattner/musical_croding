
Falling too fast 
Clearly rules don't apply 
Cant believe that I just met you 
You got me here watching minutes pass by 
Wondering when to expect you 
There you go is this a dream 
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before 
Ive seen it all before now that its over 
Should have known better 
Then to think this was real 
And you could be mine 
Should have known better 
Slowed it down 
Cause I feel you needed time 
But I kept thinkin'
This could be something [3x]
This could be [2x]
This could be something [3x]
Maybe its just nothing at all 
But this could be something 
This could be something 
This could be [2x]
This could be something [3x]
Maybe its just nothing at all 
At all [2x]
Maybe its just nothing at all 
At all [2x]
I guess its what we make it [2x]
