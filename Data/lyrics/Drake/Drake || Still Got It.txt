I got some time off,
Girl it's been so long,
That you had fun cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick,
And bring it to the crib and get all this dick
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that?
You want that feelin' back
But you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know
[2x]

I still..
