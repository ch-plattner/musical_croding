Oh, Street walker in cloves
Tell me where you go
Tell me where you go
Tell me where you go,
Tell me where you walk without moving at all

Oh what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I’ll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me,
But here in sin
Because I want water where it’s found
And you know, there there.

Oh tell me where you go
In the night, shadows are walking on the wall
Street walker where I go, is all of my fault
Just tell me where you are
Tell me where you love without leaving at all, and I’ll go!

Oh what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I’ll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me,
But here in sin
Because I want water where it’s found
And you know
If there is water, you’ll drown
Drown down in it

Drowning! Drowning! Drowning!

Oh what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I’ll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me,
But here in sin
Because I want water where it’s found
And you know
If there is water, you’ll drown
Drown down in it
