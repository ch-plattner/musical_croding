
Oh what did I say?
She's all shook up
Lost in the summer, man
We're burning up
The time don't show
When the sun gets carried
The tide curves off your body
Oh you'll stay with me

I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

Oh what did I say?
She's all shook up
Vision by the seaside
We move
But I don't know
When the fire gets hazy
The flames roll down and off her body
Oh you'll stay with me

I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
I will show you
We'll go in the night
Wondering why no one told you

Now I can walk the stones of the shoreline
And taste the ocean salt when the cold shines
My words are rolling soft down your south side

I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
I will show you
We'll go in the night
Wondering why no one told you

Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why it goes
