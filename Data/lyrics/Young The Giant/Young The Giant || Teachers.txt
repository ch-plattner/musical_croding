Teachers
They try to
Reach us
They said it too you know
But now you're grown up
And it's time
You were tested
This city made you gold and only when you're
Done
Do you miss the friends?
The names you crossed off

And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
I need this release now
I find I can't stop dreaming

I'm awake
In a parking lot
Where all the friends
The names are crossed off

Won't you ask me
Are you in love with the city?
All the stars
Whiskey bars
And I'm on my back I'm waiting
I guess you could say that I'm praying
Will I remember
Where I misplaced you?

And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
(You come back
To see it
The fever
You feel it!)
I need this release now
I find I can't stop dreaming

I'm awake
In a car
Hollywood
Boulevard
Is this who you are?

Oh!
Run now!
Run now!

I need this release now
I find I can't stop dreaming!
