
Her wings aren't tied
You're in white lies
But you're wrong dear
You won't be telling all the lies when I'm gone
And you know it's for show
Everybody holds onto something
And you can't hide me

Tell me how in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me how involved
And we will be fine
I'm still here
You're in the right
Everybody knows you tried
And I tried

Her wings aren't tied
Your on my mind
But your wrong dear
I wont be telling all the lies when you're gone
The front door opens slow
Everybody moves on someday
And I cant find your heart

Tell me you're in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me you're involved
And we will be fine
I'm still here
You're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
You tried

Your eyes open up
Inside your fine
Tell me your in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me your involved
And we will be fine
I'm still here
You're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
And you tried
