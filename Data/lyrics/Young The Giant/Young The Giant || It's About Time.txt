
All the kids are throwing sticks:
Politics
Nights on the wire!
Everybody wants to get by
'Ts a test of the times!
A test of my rights
It's on pretty lady

Born to be angry
Grip of the vice
Click on the trigger, girl;
Sip wine on ice!

It's about time
Best to rewind
You better blow
Pistols, pistols...

Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tight rope!

Don't go-o!
It's about time, It's about time!

Everybody come on
Lights on
The beaches
Everybody come on; delight!

Close the front door
I don't wanna go
Like I'm on the 'Truman Show!'

Best to let go
You don't wanna know
You better blow!

Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tight rope!

Don't go-o!
It's about time, It's about...

All the years of paradise
Paradigms
Paralyze
Us
"You're crazy!"

All the cards you've organized
Shuffled twice in front of my eyes
Everybody has
Needs, wants, a cold gun!

Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tight rope!

Don't go-o!
It's about time, It's about...PISTOLS
