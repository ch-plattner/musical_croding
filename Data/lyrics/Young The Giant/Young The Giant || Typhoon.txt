
Over and over and over again
the tide carries
I give up my water and watch you sink in
oh, the levy [?]
the night when the coastline breaks
you hide in the fallen waves
on the horizon - the sights of typhoon
washing by
and the rise falling in too
holding tight
and the dull effects of your suitcase
are cast up again

over and over and over again
(oh the sun, oh the sun)
I give her my water and watch you sink in
(oh mama, oh mama)
and night when the coastline breaks
you hide in the fallen waves
on the horizon - the sights of typhoon
washing by
and the rise falling in too
hold them tight
and the dull effects of your suit case
are cast up again

ooh oooooooh oooooh
ooh oooooooh oooooh
ooh oooooooh oooooh

on the horizon - the sights of typhoon

on the horizon - the sights of typhoon
washing by
and the rise falling in too
hold them tight
and the dull effects of your suit case
are cast up again
