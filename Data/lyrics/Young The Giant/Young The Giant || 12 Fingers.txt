
Padded by locks the door knob singed
A rusty close to a doorknob hinge
Remembering the sounds we used to know

But when those sounds sang from our halls
The backstop pressed against bleached walls
Do you remember the sound of snow?

And these flames, boil in reclaim
On the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it to
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it to
Behind the road you wait for long

So I said follow me down this time
I wrote the rules but you’ve got the time
So can you help me
I’ve got to break free from these chains oh from these chains

And these flames, boil in reclaim
On the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it to
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you wanted it to

Your eyes they fall before us
Your sighs are all around
Inside the walls have fallen
And now, you’re all alone

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it to
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you wanted it to
Behind the road, we wait for long
