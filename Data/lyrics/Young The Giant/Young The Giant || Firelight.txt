
I've been waiting many hours
By the silent moon
In the wild, the jungle flower
Your toxic perfume

Tell my friends I'm gone, it's true
I've past on now
To the eyes of a dark, lost blue

I don't believe you
I'm in a parachute
Falling in deep
Sleep
Out of control
Can you feel it?
Is this the end of the road?
Falling in deep
Lost in a dream

And the rains begin to shower
Cover me in blue
In the wild the watchman's tower
Your perfect monsoon

Tell my friends I'm gone, it's true
Tell my son I've gone away with you

I don't believe you
I'm in a parachute
Falling in deep
Sleep
Out of control
Can you feel it?
Is this the end of the road?
Trick up your sleeve
Breathe

I don't believe
Is this the end of the sea
Staring at me?
I could be free
In a dream

Lay down by the fire light
For all I know it's the last time
Tell my son
Oh
