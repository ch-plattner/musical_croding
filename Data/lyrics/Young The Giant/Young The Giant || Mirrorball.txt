
Look into the glass mirrorball
Everybody has reason to fall 
The world is round
And heavy in my mouth 

Living in the past, time is lost
I know I have made mistakes hiding in the dark
The world is small through my mirrorball

It's over now, go and tell me apart
Am I a ghost?, give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep, you're all I see
Am I a ghost? spinning out of control

Looking for some action
A poison attraction, the world is small
The world is small through my mirrorball

It's over now, go and tell me apart
Am I a ghost?, give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep, you're all I see
Am I a ghost? spinning out of control

The wait is over now 
I finally figured out
(we are the ghost) [x6]

And I told ya, I told ya I know...
(we are the ghost) [x2]

Cuz I told ya, told ya I know
