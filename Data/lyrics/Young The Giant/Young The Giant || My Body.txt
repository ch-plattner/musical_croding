Stop! the train is riding 
Down to the station 
Where you lived 
When we were school kids

Hey! the rails are gone now 
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral 
Round this town of steel

My body tells me no 
But I won't quit 
Cause I want more 
Cause I want more
My body tells me no 
But I won't quit 
Cause I want more 
Cause I want more

Stop! the train is riding 
Down to the station 
Where I lived 
When I was a cool kid

Hey! is it my fault that 
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves

My body tells me no
But I won't quit
Cause I want more
Cause I want more
My body tells me no 
But I wont quit 
Cause I want more 
Cause I want more

It rides out of town

Oh, it's my road
It's my road
It's my road
It's my road
It's my road
It's my road

And it's my war
It's my war
It's my war
It's my war

His eyes are open
His eyes are open

Oh, cause I want more
I want more
I want more

His eyes are open
His eyes are open

Hey, hey, hey-

My body tells me no 
But I won't quit 
Cause I want more 
Cause I want more
My body tells me no 
But I wont quit 
Cause I want more 
Cause I want more

It rides out of town
