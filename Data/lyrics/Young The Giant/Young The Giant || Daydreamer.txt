
It's a full moon at midnight
Running fast out of time
It's a feeling you can't describe
Floating past the pale skyline

And you look reflective
But you're so disconnected
Just think about it
What's really on your mind?
For you I would steal time
Suspicion, suspicion

You're a daydreamer oh oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream
You wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of a life
You forget, you forget

It's so affected
That color corrected night
But you're falling fast
Through plastic skies
And you look reflective
So disconnected
It's not real life

Open your eyes and breathe
Everything's in its right place
But nothing in gold can stay
Just tell me you know my face

You're a daydreamer oh oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream
You wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of a life
You forget

When the moon was high
You couldn't describe
Our lucid sky
We just might die
But we feel so alive

You're a daydreamer oh oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream
You wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of a life
You forget
