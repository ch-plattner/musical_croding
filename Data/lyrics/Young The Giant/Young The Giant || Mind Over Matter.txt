Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all 
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall 

Mind over matter,
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed!
I'm watching you this time

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all 
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall 
I missed that train
New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - sno-ooows
Go to watch the show - curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter,
You know you're on my mind!

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all 
And when the seasons change
I missed that train, will you stand by me!
(Fly to east L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall 
And if the world don't break!
All the lights aglow
(Tokyo - sno-ooows
Go to watch the show - curtain's closed)
And when the seasons change, will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
