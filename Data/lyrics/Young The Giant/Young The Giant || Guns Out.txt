Get out your guns it's time to start a fight
Whoa, and it won't take too long
I want to make it right
Just tell me that you feel the call
It's so wonderful
So I can feel wonderful

You'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere 
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful

Get out the car it's time for me to drive
Oh, you can't hide for long
I want to spend the night
Just tell me you were all alone
It's so wonderful
Hey, I feel wonderful

I'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful

Feel wonderful
Feel wonderful
How wonderful
Yeah!

I'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful

Feel wonderful
