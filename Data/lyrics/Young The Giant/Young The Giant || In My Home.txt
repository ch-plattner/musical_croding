Yeah we sleep in cars
Oh so far from home
Watch the sun go down
On the open road
I've been searching for this
Part of my life

Then the sun will rise
We'll be driving slow
Watch the kids fly by
On their telephones
I've been racing all my life
And now I'm free

Well, I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my hooome
(hey Hey Hey!)
In my hoo-oh-ome

Fast the moon approaches
And with hungry eyes
We'll be lighting torches
We'll be mesmerized
I've been yearning for this
Cover of night

When the stars come out
You are stereo
Where we going dear
I know

Well, I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my hooome
In my hoo-oh-ome

We are not lost
We're just searching
We are always, always searching for
Home
(Hey hey hey!)

We'll be going dear
Bright lights
I don't know, I fear
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed

In my hoo-oo-ome
In my hoo-oh-ome
And we are not lost
We're just searching
We are always, always searching for
(Hey hey hey!)
Home
