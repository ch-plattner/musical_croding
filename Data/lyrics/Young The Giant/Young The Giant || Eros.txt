
Why won't you call me?
Just give me your mouth
Won't you be straight with me?

I can be older
Just give me the chance
I will win it all

Can you control this sea at night?
T-take cover

Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
Put out the fire
I never let go!
Put out the fire
I let the flames grow

Don't call it quits
Cold, hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
Put out the fire
I never let go
Put out the fire
I let the flames...

I'm really sorry
But I will win unintentionally
You can be sober
But I want to dance
And I'm not dancing alone

Can you control this sea at night
Would you patrol with yellow lights?

Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
Put out the fire
I never let it go
Put out the fire!
I make the flames grow!
Don't call it quits
Cold hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
Put out the fire
I never let go
Put out the fire
I let the flames grow!...

Nobody waits nobody calls anymore; talking is dead;
These fake conversations, tired nations
Nobody cares too many thoughts at the door; it's all in your head
'Cause these days I've awakened; I've been shaken!

Here I am, here I am!
Up in flames
Here I am... go go
