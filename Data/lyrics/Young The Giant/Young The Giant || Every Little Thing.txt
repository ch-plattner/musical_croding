
Oh, I'm always home
I'm always home

In time I could see you break
Turn and see you're robbers don't shake
Walking on your tree vines
Tell them that you know your crimes

Oh, I'm always home
I'm always

When that sun has gathered round
And all is safe
Cross the falls
To the southern river
Where the robbers drank

I know that I was wrong
And that means every little thing
I want a fuck and a fight
Ooh
In time I could see you shake

When the sun has settled down
And I'm awake
Blessed souls in the southern river
Where the robbers sank

I know that I was wrong
And that mean's every little thing
I want a fuck and a fight
Every little thing too.
