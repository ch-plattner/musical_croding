
Paralyzed, on the floor again. 
Lately I've been fiending.

Cause it's over, I'm stupid. 
Living a lie on my own, so alone. 
You're calling consistently 
but I'm paralyzed on the floor far from you.

And lately I've been thinking 
I'm not feeling anything at all. 
Will I survive in the dead of night? 
And now the lights are fading faster. 
Save me from my disaster, my disaster.

Lay the lights down low 
God only knows I give up to the fire. 
You didn't always come up from the water. 
I only thought you were crying from laughter. 
Saving myself from the mouth of a monster. 
Paralyzed on the floor again. 
Baby I've been fiending.

And lately I've been thinking 
I'm not feeling anything at all. 
Will I survive in the dead of night? 
And now the lights are fading faster. 
Save me from my disaster, my disaster.

Paralyzed on the floor.

And lately I've been feeling 
I'm not feeling anything at all. 
Will I survive in the dead of night? 
And now the lights are fading faster. 
Save me from my disaster, my disaster.

God only knows I give up to the fire. 
You didn't always come up from the water. 
I only thought you were crying from laughter. 
Saving myself from the mouth of a monster. [x2]
