
Here it goes
Chemical is on its way
And my box is packed
Or should I stay? (it's coming)
We can analyze, philosophize
But who's to say
All we know is
We're here today

Look in my eyes
This is just the reason why I stay
I know there are things we shouldn't say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cause I couldn't feel the
Pain

Fight the fear
Taste the grip
Feel the slip
Shake the soul
Feel the waves
In and out, and in and out, and in and out

Look in my eyes
This is just the reason why I stay
I know there are things we shouldn't say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cause I couldn't feel the
Pain

Feel the weight wash away
All the mistakes I've made
Living in time on my own
Tearing the soul from bone
Letting the tide suck me in
And chemicals burst in
These are my only friends
Giving me waves until the end
Ooooooh
