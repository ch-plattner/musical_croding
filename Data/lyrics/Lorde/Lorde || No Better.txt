We roll in heavy summer when there’s strength in our numbers
And your breath’s hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to.

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it’s humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it’s shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn’t happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn’t winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you’re no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing.

Go all the way,
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do you your thing, do it well
This will take you down.

I’ll pull the trick if I want to
I’ll pull the trick and it comes true
I’m chewing gum and it’s killing you
We’re getting dead and it’s the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You’re allergic but you never said
We’re getting dead and it’s the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
