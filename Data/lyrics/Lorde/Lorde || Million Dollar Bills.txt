
There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives
A limit in spite will do the trick trick trick trick

We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park park park park
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
It's like a bird eyes in the dark dark dark dark

We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go

It's not about just being out with all our people
Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
