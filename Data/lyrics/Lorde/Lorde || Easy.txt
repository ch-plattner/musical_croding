
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart
To make the being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart
To make the being alone
Easy, oh, easy.

Easy, easy
You switch the screens off
for the rest of the foes
Easy, easy
They poke around until they,
Get what they want
Easy, oh, easy

Oh, easy, easy
Throw out the ones you picked
For those summer nights its
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the ones you picked oh,
Easy

Easy, easy
Pull out the heart
That keeps you feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart
To make the being alone
Easy
