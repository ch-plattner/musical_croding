[Verse 1:]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay)

[Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Verse 2:]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

[Chorus 2:]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

[Post-Chorus:]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

[Bridge:]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

[Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you
