
No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique and dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship, but
My mamma hanging my sister, sit
It's on now, the days are long now
The ups and the sun downs
In the twisting mind
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Try your hardest and melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now a star burst
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine

Will I know when it's finally done
This whole life is hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be
