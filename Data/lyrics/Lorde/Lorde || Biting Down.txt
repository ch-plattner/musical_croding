It feels better biting down [x6]

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)

Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)

Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)

It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down) [x3]

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)

Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)

Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down [x2]

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down) [x2]

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
