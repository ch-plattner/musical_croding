[Verse 1]
Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I say falls right back
Into everything I'm not
In the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Chorus]
Riding around on the bikes, we’re still sane
I won’t be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it’s all cool, I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I’m coming for you
(Chase paper, get it)
I'm little but I’m coming for the title
Held by everyone who’s up

[Verse 2]
All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on the new shit, yeah, yeah

[Bridge:]
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?

[Chorus x2]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Outro]
All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah
