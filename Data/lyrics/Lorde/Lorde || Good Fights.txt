
There’s no love
Take my friends
You don’t really love them
But, you really love when braid your hair and give in
You try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends it spins again

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
It’s alright, it’s alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There a place in your head for what doesn't
make sense, for the things you don’t get.
Look them up when you get it.
You can try to get in, but rejected again.
I feel off again, I guess so well.

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
It’s alright, it’s alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
you still love, too spend up time
Driving like a car in the moonlights out
Oh,we move side by side
Some times we play,we play alone
Examine love, freak face
Oh,it's good again

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
