I've been moving my head.
You've been feeling on spaces,
I'm working too much.

It's the life, we're livin' now
And it's beautiful somehow.

I've been waiting for the sun to rise.
Where you are?
So I can tell you're a superstar.
I've been waiting for our words to be end as lies
So I can let you know that baby, 
you're the rest of my life.

You have loved, you have cared
You've been too good to me.
I can try harder enough,
just to make you believe.

They've been holding on to us
Cause we made a way too much.

That looks like our past
And they'll admire that we made it best
So I've been waiting for the sun to rise.
Where you are?
So I can tell you're a superstar.

You know I think about it all the time.
You would run away with me
And we've been looking for a place to hide
And you would at home with me
You would be at home with me
We would be at home.

I've been waiting for the sun to rise.
Where you are?
So I can tell you're a superstar.
I've been waiting for our words to be end as lies
So I can let you know that baby, 
you're the rest of my life.
