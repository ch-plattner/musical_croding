
Uh oh uh oh 

Every night I go
Every night I go sneaking out the door 
I lie a little more, baby I'm helpless

There's something about the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies deep inside me

What would my mama do?
Uh oh uh oh 
She knows about me and you 
Uh oh uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh uh oh 
She saw me hurt this way 
Uh oh uh oh

Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
And here we are again, it's nearly perfect 

What would my mama do?
Uh oh uh oh
She knows about me and you
Uh oh uh oh 
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh uh oh
He saw me hurt this way 

Uh oh uh oh
