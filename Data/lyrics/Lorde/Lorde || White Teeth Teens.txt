[Verse 1:]
We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

[Pre-chorus:]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

[Chorus:]
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this

[Verse 2:]
If you want we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling
But the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop us when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop thisâŸ“

(And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could)

[Bridge:]
I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing
And love it

[Outro:]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out
