And I'm begging her
Come back, come back,
Come back, come back, come back.

I'm sorry that I made you cry,
I'm sorry for the rest of my life,
And I'm sorry that I hurt you,
And I'm sorry for lying to you.

And I'm lost without you,
'Cause I'm all about you,
Want you to hear the state of mind I'm in?
I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend

Can you hear me, girl? Can you forgive me?
I don't want no tickets, no limo ride.
I'm the next caller on the line!

This is a radio message to my baby,

Sorry I didn't do what I promised,
And I'm sorry you're sorry that we ever met.

And I'm lost without you,
