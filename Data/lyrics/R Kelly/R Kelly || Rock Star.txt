[Chorus:]
Lights, that's the stamina action
I'm a rock star
Check the crowd reaction
I like lights, that's the stamina action

Check the crowd reaction
I'm like

Hey, you're a rock star baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey you're a rock star baby
Throwing ass like that you must be a rock star baby

[Verse 1]
Luda, hey
I'm gonna strung your body your body like a guitar string
Stunting in Roberto Cavalli mami with the dime frame
Hotter than tamales you probably should be my wild thing
Tell them other chicks mind they own business and let us do our own thing
I got you open your open-stroking now your soaking wet
and I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em and and I yoke they neck
You gonna make a player choose
Show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session let me show you a thing or 2
I'll strip you, I'll strip you down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick you, I'll lick you down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whipped cream
Then I'll put her on her back get mean
Then I'll get her in the matrix, cut her lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top of her lungs
Give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref
Ludacris is tired of playing
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that you got everybody saying

[Chorus:]
Hey, you're a rock star baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey you're a rock star baby
Throwing ass like that you must be a rock star baby
Say I'm a rockstar baby
Fucking with this weed and Patr√£n got me hazy
Hey I'm rockstar baby
So put 'em up if you're a rockstar baby

[Verse 2]
Girl your booty so swole
How you get them jeans around it
Girl your booty so swole
Why you think I'm singing about it
Hit it hard from the back
And then I go to sleep and dream about it
It's like that ass is crack
The way you got me feenin about it
I'm telling you now the way we fuck
Gonna lead to child birthin'
Rocking to this guitar
Is bout to have me crowd surfing
Kells'll put on a show
Up until they close curtains
Then right after the show
Backstage ass hurting
Call me scottie 'cause girl, 'cause girl
I'm a about to beam up
Once I get, get you
Gone, come on up out of those D cups
Stroking it hard stroking it hard
While you got your legs up
Making your making your sound like your
Got the hiccups
Know what you want Kell's about to give you what you need
Up in my room you're screaming Hercules Hercules
Man get Kells & Luda on a track a hit is guaranteed
Everybody's on they feet
This is what you all shirt should read

[Chorus]

I got my drink in my cup.
I got my hands in the air
I'm about to set this bitch off
Like I'm a rockstar baby
We out of this club
Wanna hit the after party
All the ladies coming with me
'cause I'm a rockstar baby

So put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Everybody's in the building come on real swizzy
If you're a rockstar baby

[Chorus]

Lights, that's the stamina action
I'm a rock star
Check the crowd reaction
I like lights, that's the stamina action
I'm a rock star
Check the crowd reaction
Lights, that's the stamina action
