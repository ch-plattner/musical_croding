[R Kelly]
What is this news you got to tell me
Gurl wat has got you so excited
Why would you call me on my job
When im rite in the middle of writing
See you got this look upon your face
Spit it out girl i jus cannot wait
To get whatever it is up out of you
So tell me girl..wat it do

[Girl]
I'll give you a hint
It crawls before it walks
In a couple of years it begins to talk
And it makes us so happy 
(girl are you tellin me)

[Chorus]
(im having a baby)
Ooh, im so happy
(im having a baby)
And im so glad to be that baby's daddy
(im having a baby)
A little girl, a little boy, a little you, a little me
(im having a baby)
Girl it doesnt matter, as long as its healthy

[Verse]
Wow! i cant believe im going to be a father
In nine months a child will be born
Baby you're pregnant in april
Which means we're having a capricorn
Im so glad to be apart of this
Cuz girl a child is heaven sent
This is a blessing to me
To have you build my seed

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
Girl you got me staring at you from head to toe
When i look at you its like you got this glow
So much respect, i have for you, girl since you told, me the good news
Ever since you told me you love me more
Girl what i feel is so spiritual
And baby our lives has been changed
Now i want you to have my.. last name

[Chorus:]
(im having a baby)
Girl im so glad
(im having a baby)
And im so proud to be that baby's daddy
(im having a baby)
Said a little boy, a little girl, a little you, a little me
(im having a baby)
Girl it doesnt matter, and now here it is 9 months later
