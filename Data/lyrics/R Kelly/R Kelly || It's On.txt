This drink... Got me in the club, so gone
(Ace Hood!) Gone~
Man, I'm like...

[Hook:]
Damn, that body. Damn, that waist
Damn, that dress. Damn, that face
It's on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on
(DJ Khaled!)
All up in the club, all up in the backseat
All up in the crib (What?!) All up in the bed like-
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh
(Kels! Go get 'em)

[Verse 1:]
She bending it over
While she looking back at me
I ain't never had a chick get it up like this
Am I caught up? Probably
(Woop!) More curves than a racetrack
And I just wanna ride it
I ain't never had a chick catch my eye like this
Make me leave the club early
(What?!) Got a body of a dancer
Baddest in the party
Scale of one to ten
And that ain't no exaggeration

[Hook:]
We be talking money, this the major league (It's On!)
Don't make sense, not to leave with me
Tell the valet, he can get the keys. C'mon
You got me thinking...

[Hook:]
Damn, that body. Damn, that waist
Damn, that dress. Damn, that face
It's on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on
(It's On!)
All up in the club, all up in the backseat
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like-
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh

[Verse 2:]
The way you do it ain't fair, ma... Ew, you wrong
But it feels so right, fits so tight; I be in it til the mo'
(What?!) Cell phone on the charger
We gon let it ring
I ain't never had a chick make me forget
Where I need to be
(C'mon!) Such a performer
The way I gotta sing it~
I know I gotta go, but it don't look like I'm leaving

[Bridge:]
Girl, how you doing it... To the beat (Yeah!)
You gon make me lose all my sanity (What?!)
The way you move you're body it's a... Mazing me, c'mon!
You got me saying...

[Hook:]
Damn, that body. Damn, that waist
Damn, that dress. Damn, that face
(It's On!)
It's on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on
All up in the club, all up in the backseat
{Ace Hood!}
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like-
{Yeah...}
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
{Know it's on, lil mama}
Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Cause, yeah-Damn, shawty know she dead wrong
Way that dress fitting you would think it was painted on
Wine fine, dime. Hoping that you came alone
Even if you didn't, tell that lame nigga go on
Sayonara; Coupe is painted aqua
Body such a movie, girl, you deserve an Oscar
Kick it with the fliest nigga, dinnertime-lobster
Pussy good, swear I might consider me a sponsor
And that could truly be the liquor talking
(Oh!)
Words slurring like I'm fresh up out the dentist office
Yeah, and it ain't hard to tell "I'm On One"~
Pitch to me, guarantee I hit a homerun
From the Phantom to the counter to my bedspring
(Oh!)
Know it's on when I'm alone, let the phone rang
Damn, that body; Far beyond a hottie
Brought my nigga Kels, ain't no cuffing at the party but um...

[Hook:]
Damn, that body. Damn, that waist (Woo!)
Damn, that dress. Damn, that face
(It's On!)
It's on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on
All up in the club (What?!) All up in the backseat (What?!)
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like-
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh
(DJ Khaled!)
