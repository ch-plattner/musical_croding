Shut up
I don't ever wanna hear you say that again
Baby, i'm not goin; nowhere
Look at me, you understand me?

What gave you the silly idea...that i'm about to leave,
Girl, who you be listenin' to...they must be crazy.
Look back and see our past and all the shit that we've been through,
I'll be damned if i'm gonna let this bull crap take me away from you.
Cause i've vowed to give my all and girl i'm a man of my word,
And on that word i'll stand tall..bein' without you sounds obserd.

So dry your weeping eyes..cause i'll be here by your side,
No need to doubt this guy..i'm in this for the long ride.

I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl i'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together,nothing can't take that away
I will ne e ever leave, no
Now until forever i'll be with you the rest of my days

You never have to question..the love I have for you,
Girl, I will put my life..on bended knees for you.
Ask all my friends they'll tell you..you're all I talk about,
Even when I go to sleep you're the only one I dream about.
See i'm your picture, girl and baby you are my frame,
That's why I know our love will stay the same.

So dry your weeping eyes..weeping eyes girl i'm by your side,
Just trust me i'm that guy..i'm in it for the long ride.

I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl i'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together,nothing can't take that away
I will ne e ever leave, no
Now until forever i'll be with you the rest of my days

Since the day that doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me,
Girl, I was born to be with you and the rest is history.
Generations and now i'm all grown up and you carry my seed,
Now we have flesh and blood with you I am in love.

For the rest of my life [2x]

We've been blessed with a love that's rare and i'm not goin' nowhere.

I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl i'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together,nothing can't take that away
I will ne e ever leave, no
Now until forever i'll be with you the rest of my days
