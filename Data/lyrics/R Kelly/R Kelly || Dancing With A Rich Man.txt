
Entrea
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero
Decirte yo quiero 
Hacer por ti
But first we must dancce

Private cotillion style
One lady's fantasy 
Trip to Milan tonight 
Exclusive shopping spree
Mansions await, your scent 
That smells just like treasure 
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

[1] - As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Kissing the feet of you
While listening to Bonsois
And your angelic brace
Wearing Victoria 
Passionate love with you 
Hearing you "Oh, oui oui" 
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire's gallery 

[Repeat 1]

And when you elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors
Sunsets on yellow sand 
That's where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

[Repeat 1]
