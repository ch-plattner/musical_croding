[CHORUS]
I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

[R KELLY]
I been around the world and back like what up
East side to west side tourin like what up
And even though the price for the house was so much
I still roll with them from the hood like what up
Cuz when it comes to bein the realest im sho nuff
Im a straight up industry villain fo sho nuff
And I cant satisfy some a yall no matter what
And some of ya'll cats are so jealous
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Aint nuttin but fake faces fake people fake friends
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there aint nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas
Yea I know I need a hug but yall need a hug too
Cuz god gunna judge me the same day he judge you
And even though we have our struggles that’s alright
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine

[CHORUS]
I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

[JA RULE]
Sometimes this world can be so cold
When you looking through the windows of the soul
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds
Cuz I been around this globe and back 
Enough to know the fact
Who loves me
And who loves me not
We be shit’s so hot
You could put it in red tops
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block
Until they heart stops
That’s why they fiend for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord
And im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords 
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame
Im sorry I changed the game
But its mine and I cant complain
Rule and R Kelly
Been around the world
Puttin it on women
Bumpin n grindin these bitches
But we always on time when a woman fed up
And that’s love
That’s why they all fuck wit us

[CHORUS]
I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

[R KELLY]
Said my lyrics is my testimony
That’s how I live
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies
Over the years
You see me on tv sometimes
Not how it is
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz 
When im rollin through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though im not conceited (right)
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever
Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we'll make it better

[CHORUS]
I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

Said I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me
