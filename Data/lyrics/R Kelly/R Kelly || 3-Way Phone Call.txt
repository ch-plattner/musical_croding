Hello

[Kelly Price:]
Hey little brother

[R. Kelly:]
Hey sis how you doing?

[Kelly Price:]
Fine, what's going on with you?

[R. Kelly:]
Oh nothing much

[Kelly Price:]
Got your message from earlier this afternoon
And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

[R. Kelly:]
Oh everything is fine

[Kelly Price:]
You know I don't believe you

[R. Kelly:]
Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?

[Kelly Price:]
I'm not saying it, but I know you

[R. Kelly:]
How you know me?

[Kelly Price:]
Cause you're my brother
And therefore I can tell
When something is troubling you

[R. Kelly:]
Ok Ok, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind
But sis, I don't want to waste your time

[Kelly Price:]
But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

[R. Kelly:]
But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

[Kelly Price:]
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

[R. Kelly:]
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

[R. Kelly:]
Can you tell me what to do?

[Kelly Price:]
Well first you gotta believe the truth

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

[Kelly Price:]
That's okay because he believes in you

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

[R. Kelly:]
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door

[R. Kelly:]
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me

[Kelly Price:]
When we're keeping it real
Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

[R. Kelly:]
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I...

[Kelly Price:]
Just wait, let me make a phone call

[R. Kelly:]
To who?

[Kelly Price:]
A prayer buddy of mine
She can help you tear down your walls

[R. Kelly:]
I don't want nobody in my business

[Kelly Price:]
She's a friend
And besides you need this

[R. Kelly:]
You know how church folk can be

[Kelly Price:]
Boy I'm your sister, trust in me

[R. Kelly:]
Mmm

[Kelly Price:]
Now hold on

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe she's gone...

[Kelly Price:]
No

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe we ought to just try...

[Maurice Mahon:]
Hello

[Kelly Price:]
Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?

[Maurice Mahon:]
Yes, I think she's around here somewhere
Hold on

[Kelly Price:]
Now you just let me do the talking

[R. Kelly:]
Mmm hmm

[Kim Burrell:]
Hello?

[Kelly Price:]
Hey girl, how you doing?

[Kim Burrell:]
Hey Kelly

[Kelly Price:]
My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you

[Kim Burrell:]
Ooh what can I do for you?
Hello?

[Kelly Price:]
Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you

[R. Kelly:]
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

[Kim Burrell:]
Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through

[R. Kelly:]
Really?

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes, and sometimes I still do

[R. Kelly:]
Yeah?

[Kim Burrell:]
See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

[Kelly Price:]
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

[R. Kelly:]
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you

[R. Kelly:]
Oh

[Kim Burrell:]
Just stand strong

[Kelly Price:]
Stand strong

[Kim Burrell:]
With your head held high

[Kelly Price:]
With your head held high

[Kim Burrell:]
Said it wont be long
In time he will provide

[R. Kelly:]
Will he?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes he will

[Kim Burrell:]
You just stay in the race

[Kelly Price:]
Just stay in the race

[Kim Burrell:]
And keep on running

[Kelly Price:]
And down to the end

[Kim and Kelly:]
Cause your day is coming

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through

[Kelly Price:]
He'll give you peace
In the midst of your storm

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me

[Kelly Price:]
But he'll never leave you

[Kim Burrell:]
No way

[Kelly Price:]
You just gotta hang on

[Kim Burrell:]
Hang on

[Kelly Price:]
Robert say a prayer, keep your head
God will do just what he said

[R. Kelly:]
Finally I think I get it

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, that's it
That's the spirit

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
