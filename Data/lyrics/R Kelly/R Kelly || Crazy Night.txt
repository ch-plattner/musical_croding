We ain't gon leave till four in the morning.
Thousand dollar tab, what? I can afford it.
On my fourth drink, but I'm not an alcoholic.
Shawty say she want me, She way too scrawny.
5'4" Park I might be too horny to go home lonely, I can't be lonely.
Left the last club cuz the DJ was boring came back, Valet parked in the Valet Parking.
Nigga true story, that was 12:40, bout 1 o'clock I was back in the warey?
Tipsy, Farrari, Tennesse got me, oh baby I'm so sorry.

But if you're drinking what I'm drinking put your hands up in the sky
If you're thinking what I'm thinking you'll say what a crazy night
Way ohhhh (hey) Way ohhh (hey) Way ohhh (hey) Way ohhh a what a crazy night Way oh.

We ain't gon leave till four maybe later.
Swag so punk it make, it make ya ugly face uh.
Run that back, it means start that over
Shawty get closer, hot like a toaster.
Body so tight like she walked off the poster.
Kells caked up make her call me the baker.
Man he a hater, she gun see me later.
He got good intentions, but not another favor.
We left doing 80 called up fly up on a friday, headed back the highway, I think that there's my place.
So f*cked up man it's just not my day.
I need another shot of that Bacardi.

But if you're drinking what I'm drinking put your hands up in the sky
If you're thinking what I'm thinking you'll say what a crazy night.
Way ohhhh (hey) Way ohhh (hey) Way ohhh (hey) Way ohhh a what a crazy night Way oh.
