I just can't think of what it is

Girl, please let me stick my key in your ignition,
babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See, I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy

So buckle up 'cause this can get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions,
babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can wax it, baby
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got the shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just thuggin' it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe
And I'm about to take it where you wanna go, babe
Guarantee you I'm about to get some mileage, babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas, babe

It's like woo...pull over, baby
And let me put this love van off in your trunk, babe
So buckle up 'cause this can get bumpy, babe
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got the shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just thuggin' it out

Now hold on tight 'cause I'm about to go faster, babe
Girl, you're dealin' with a pro behind this wheel,
babe
So tell me have you ever driven a stick, babe
You'll be screamin' every time we shiftin' gears, babe

So brace yourself while I'm hittin' them corners, babe
And when it's over put that tails on your license
plate
Now buckle up 'cause this can get bumpy, baby
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows (Yeah)
We got the radio up (Uh)
We all up in the back
We got the shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just thuggin' it out

When I hear you say {Green light} I'mma go
{Yellow light} Do it slow {Red light} I'mma stop
When I hear you say {Switch lanes} hit the signal
{Pit stop} Take a break, hit the hazards when we park

When you say {Green light} I'mma go
{Yellow light} Do it slow {Red light} I'mma stop
When you say {Switch lanes} hit my signal
{Pit stop} Take a break, because we're 'bout to go
this far

'Cause we off up in this jeep (Off up in this jeep)
We foggin' up the windows (Baby, you and me)
We got the radio up (Got the radio)
We all up in the back (All up in the back)
We got the shit bouncin' (Got this baby bouncin')
We goin' up and down (Goin' up and down)
And we smokin' and we drinkin' (Smokin')
Just thuggin' it out (It's the thuggin' out)

Bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce

Now usually I don't do this, but, uh
Go 'head on bring 'em off with little previews of the
remix

Now I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus Coupe
That's why I'm all up in your grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field
