
Temperatures rising, 
And Your body's yearnin' for me. 
Girl, lay it on me, 
I place no one above thee, 
Oh, take me to your ecstasy. 

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl are you ready, 
To go all the way? 
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way? 

I can smell your perfume, 
Step into my bedroom, 
Let me love you constantly. 
Oh,oh, your body is my playground, 
Let me lick you up and down, 
Make you feel like a woman should. 

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way? 
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way?
