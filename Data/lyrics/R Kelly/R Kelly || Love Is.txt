Said I'm feeling pretty good right now baby, (oh boy)
Good about our lovin' darling, listen..

Like the world goes around everyday baby,
That is how you spin me,
Might as well call me a telegram baby,
'Cause darling that's just how you send me, yeah
I'm might as well take me a pen and sign a wave,
To be yours for the rest of my life,
You rescued me from heartache just like a savior,
Now being in your arms is like my paradise,

Listen baby,
Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss,
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this,
You're a genie to me baby, the way you grant my wish,
And tonight we gonna let the world hear it,
This is how our love is, (you and me forever baby, sing it darlin')
This is how our love is, (can't nobody come between, now baby)

Listen honey,
Ain't no dog what we got baby is one of a kind,
We're in the hall of fame as the greatest love of all time,
So many said that this love wouldn't last too long,
But we've got the victory darling and proved them all wrong,
Just like the sun comes in, chased away the rain,
See I love you boy, you take away my pain,
It don't matter where you are, just call me baby,
'Cause I'll run a million miles to get you baby,

Listen honey now,
Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss,
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this,
You're a genie to me baby, the way you grant my wish,
And tonight we gonna let the world hear it,
This is how our love is, (you and me forever baby, sing it to me darlin')
This is how our love is, (can't nobody come between us baby)

Now let me tell you how I feel,
See our loves is like a antidote and we can heal the whole wide world with it darling,
This love is like a people's hope, something's out of hand of me baby, cause it's ?calling you?,
Oh girl when we're touching (touching)
Oh when we're feeling (feeling)
It's crazy like walking on the ceiling,

This is how our love is, (baby you and me, sing it to me girl)
This is how our love is, (baby and can't nobody come between)
This is how our love is, (raise me in the snow, I want the whole wide world to know)
This is how our love is, (forever in a day, it will always be this way)
This is how our love is, (take it or leave it)
This is how our love is, (take it or leave it)
