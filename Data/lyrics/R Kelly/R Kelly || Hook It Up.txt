Kells I see you pimping in the club wit the baddest chick
If she gotta partner tell her she should get wit this
A well known money maker H-U-E-Y
If you u need a man to give you real love
You know that the nigga be I
The type that will take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good
A 500 hundred Benz you could grip a little wood
If you were my girl I would do what I could 
As long as she understand it's 50
You do for me I do for you
You shoot for me I shoot for you
You b sweet to me then i'm sweet to you
You may think lying but it the truth
Cuz I aint gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimping
But imma make you my mistress
To avoid your life looking ruff
Head and attitude all messed up
All you gotta do is holler at kells 
And tell him gone hook it up

[Chorus]
If she got a friend homie
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she gotta cousin homie 
Tell ya girl to hook it up
Is she gotta sister homie
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she look like her act like her 
Caller her let me hook it up

If she sexy like that 
Tell ya girl to hook it up 
Sweet and she don't talk back
Tell ya girl hook it up
If she's looking for that real love
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she look like her act like her act like her
Call her let me hook it up

If she like real playas 
Don't fuck with no haters 
Wanna get with a real baller
That making that real paper
If she wants good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows party mingle with the stars
Long as she understands that 
That I am her blinding man
When comes to selling out
She's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot of girlfriends
Tell her girlfriend to holler at her future boyfriends
Hook it up

[Chorus]
If she got a friend homie
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she gotta cousin homie 
Tell ya girl to hook it up
Is she gotta sister homie
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she look like her act like her 
Caller her let me hook it up

If she sexy like that 
Tell ya girl to hook it up 
Sweet and she don't talk back
Tell ya girl hook it up
If she's looking for that real love
Tell ya girl to hook it up
If she look like her act like her 
Call her let me hook it up
