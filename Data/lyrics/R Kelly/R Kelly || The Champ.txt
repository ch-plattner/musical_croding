Hey
Hey
Ladies And Gentleman The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
Get Your Mutha Fuckin Hands In The Air
(OooohhhhOhhhhhh)
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
You Can Hate Me I Don't Care

All Y'all Wanna Pile On Me
Make It Hard For Me To Breathe
Throw Sand In My Eyes
And Make It Hard For Me To See
Out Of Breath
Can't See
Still Hard To Defeat
The History That I Make
Impossible To Repeat
Spread Rumors
Point Fingers
Throw Stones
Judge Me

Hate Me
Love Me
Hug Me
Curse Me

Whatever
'Cause Y'all Fuckin' Opinions Don't Feed Me
I'm Clever
And Nothin' Know That The Industry Needs Me

(Second Round!!)
I'm Opposite Of The Demon That Faces Me
I've
Been Through Hell
Live In The Belly Of The Beast
I
Confess My Sins
But Still Didn't Find Peace
But
Like MJ And Five
I Will Six Peak

(Third Round!!)
I Write Music For Hood First
'Cause That's Where I'm From
That's Why The Hood Is Always First
To Help Me Overcome

(Fifth Round!!)
When I'm Down Some o' Y'all Cats Act So Strange
And When I'm Up Same Cats Wonder Why I Act So Strange

(Sixth Round)
Kells Ain't Change
Please You Bitches Is So Lame
Somethin' Ain't Y'all Fault
Then Y'all So Quick To Blame
That's Why I Got Number One On The Back O' My Range
Y'all Cats Is Full Playin'
I'm Pregnant By The Game

(Seventh Round!!)
Some Would Like To See Me Ball And Chain
But I'm A Child Of God
So My Destiny's Ordained

(Eighth Round!!)
Undisputed Is The Title I Claim
'Bout To Shoot The World Up With This Lyrical Cocaine

(Ninth Round!!)
The Place Is Packed
The Bell Rings
I'm About To Bring The Pain
Left Jab
Right Hook
Shuttin' Down Yo' Brain

(Tenth Round!!)
I Could Be Surrounded By Lions In The Midst Of The Jungle
And Still I'm A Rumble Young Man Rumble

Ladies And Gentlemen
(Eleventh Round!!)
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
Get Your Mutha Fuckin' Hands In The Air
(Get Your Mutha Fuckin' Hands In The Air)
(OooohhhhOhhhhhh)
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
The Champ Is Here
You Can Hate Me I Don't Care
