
All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me and inside no peace

And the mountains seemed impossible to climb until...

[Chorus]

You stood on the front lines
You led the way, out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart

Oceans so deep
Uphill so steep
But still we believe
And when the road was too far to travel 
Heros you came and carried us there

And the mountains seemed impossible to climb until...

[Chorus]

And so our flag was still there
All because you decided to care

[Chorus x2]

You stood on the front lines
You led the way, out of the darkness
You could have let us go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart

And that takes a soldier's heart
