Music must be a lady
The way it makes sweet love to me
Me, you, music, music,
I'm so amazed by your choice of melodies that you used on me
Lady music, when we make love it's like we're making love with the same key
Music must a lady cause of the way you sing your melody, woman, oh,
Walk on by your sexual energy
Miss conduct all up orchestration means how to please you
In this room music I do for you

I hear a drum roll as we...
When you grace my stage I can't find the words to say...
Music must be, must be a woman
You're my anthem, you're the reason why I dance
Music, missis music, miss music, I wanna make your body sing songs of joy and happiness

Write your words in my bed
Miss music, said I'll never fall in love, never ever fall in love
Now here I am in love, so so in love with you
Miss music, this love making is so unique,
Go on and let it ring out over me like a choir at its peak
Music, said I celebrate you and I honor you and I salute you
And I sing my heart out to you,
Music, cause you deserve it and I would like to do some things to you
Music, so get ready, miss music, get ready darling,
Cause I'm about to add, I'm a need to your life
Love making do it, just to be precise baby
Music, hello sweet soprano, miss music
I want you to meet mister tenor
And I love your music, as a matter of fact I'm quite a big fan
Music, missis music, missed you, missis music, music
