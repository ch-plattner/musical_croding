[Verse 1:]
I could never be ya boyfriend 
Cuz you know I gotta special girl 
And I could never be ya husband 
But doht dont mean you still dont rock ma world 
And I can you take you to an island 
We can be there just the two of us 
God I love to see you smilin 
All I ask is that you keep it hushed 

[Chorus:]
Be ma #2 
Gurl I love you 
Be my #2 
Gurl I need you 
Be my #2 
Gurl ur so fine (so fine) 
Be my #2 
But you will never be my #1 [echo x3]

[Verse 2:]
I could take you out to dinner 
But theres a couple places we wont go 
Cuz #1 is a beginner 
And theres a couple things that she dont know
So I can take you to a hotel 
We can be there just the two of us 
Gurl I love you cuz you dont tell 
Nd you know how to keep it hush hush 

[Chorus:]
Be ma #2 
Gurl I love you 
Be my #2 
Gurl I need you 
Be my #2

Be my #2 
But you will never be my #1 [echo x3]
