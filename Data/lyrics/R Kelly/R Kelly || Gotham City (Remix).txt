Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto [2x]

Uhhh Yo yo! Everybody's talking
about the good old days [2x]
Huh I remember when me and my brothers
we used to sit up on the poarch in the
summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
you know what I'm saying to rise and
be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up

I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeahh
ghetto for ya 
So I took this remix and 
rearranged gotham city

[Chorus:]
City of love a city of peace
for everyone of us 
'Cause we all need it,
can't live without it
Gothamcity for the ghetto yeah! 

Gotham city for the ghetto,
that's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghettofabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffiness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (ohh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best 
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
would I keep on strugling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed babygirl who would die

We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Everytime something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeahh!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
a gotham city

[Chorus]

Check it out
Now motherfucka wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, block my cream
Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto

We all need hey hey hey
Gothamcity for the ghetto yeah
Calling on heaven
Send your love down, to the ghetto yeah
Talking about a land where ohh yeah
Where there will be no more crying,
no more crying now oh yeah
A place where we could all just get along yeah
And children will sing ghetto love songs
In a land where (city of love) 
In a land where (for every one of us)
