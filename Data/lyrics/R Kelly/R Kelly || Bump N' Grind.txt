
My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you

[Chorus 2x:]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

See, I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl
So, baby, bring your body to me (bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you,
Baby, my love is true
With you is where I wanna be,

Girl, you need someone, someone like me, yeah
To satisfy your every need

[Chorus 2x]

You say he's not treating you right
Lady spend the night now
I'll love you like you need to be loved (girl, won't you try some of me?)
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my doors
You'll never want another love
You'll never find another me

You see you need someone, someone like me, yeah
To make love to you, baby, constantly

[Chorus 2x]
