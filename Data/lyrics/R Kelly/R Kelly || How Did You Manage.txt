
You made the sun,
You made the moon,
Gave seasons change,
Woah
You made the clouds,
You put the rainbow after rain
Woah
Created time,
Now this ones mine,
Gave pictures frames,
Woah
Created man gave him woman,
Why did you do that for me?

These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep, (ooh sometimes i wonder)
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,
There's still one mystery,
How did you manage to love me?

You breathed the life right into me,
Then made my heart beat,
Woah
Created the mountains,
And all of the deep seas,
Flowers in the trees,
Woah
You made tommorrow come again,
You calmed the strong winds,
Woah
And after all I've done,
Gave me a son,
Tell me why would you do that for me?

These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep,
(Right in the middle of my prayers)
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,
There's still one mystery,
How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?)
How did you manage to love me?

Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?)
After all that i have done, oh Lord
How? (how did you manage to love?)
How could i have been so bad, oh Lord
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)
Even when i didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord.
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me.
(How did you manage to forgive me?)
Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)
