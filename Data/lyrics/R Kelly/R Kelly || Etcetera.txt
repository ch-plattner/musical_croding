
Baby, I'm so glad you're over here
Now I get to show you all the things
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time
Don't say nuthin'

Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter
Feeding each other fruits babe
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind
And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love

[1] - Girl tonight we'll make sweet love
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me
All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera
Wanna kiss you places you want me to
Promise girl that I'll do all of these things
And etcetera etcetera etcetera

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Doing you pretty much all night long babe
'Till I hear you screaming my name babe
In the pool you and me skinny dippin darlin' Kelly's rules
No playing hard to get now tell me what the deal cuz
Girl tonight we'll be making sweet love

[Repeat 1]

Put on some clothes and lets go to the IHOP, baby
(Let's go to the IHOP babe)
No, no, no (Baby we just made love)
No matter how good the food may taste
(No matter how the food may taste)
I'm still thinking about your body baby, yes I am
(It's your body I'm thinking of)

[Repeat 1 until fade]
