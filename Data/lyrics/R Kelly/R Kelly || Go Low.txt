Goooooo low.....Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (gooooo Low)
Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (goooooo low)
Girl I just want to take yo clothes off,
Put you in the bed,
girl lick yo body real slow,
Goo Low
Girl I wanna be sipping (sipping)
on your sweet sweet water (water)
Its crunch time bout to give you that 12 play...
This is the 4th quarter

Some people sit right there, and cant say whats on they minds
Some people want to FREAK and some are just too damn shy
But with me that not the deal, girl I say how I feel
When I see something like, Im gonna keeep it real
For instance you look like food, I wanna put you on my plate (would you like that)
Suck you up with some biscuits and go on and eat you baby (would you like that)
Up until you make it rain, grab my ears and pull my face
Tonight I’ll be giving you brain (gooooo low)

Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (gooooo Low)
Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (goooooo low)
Girl I just want to take yo clothes off,
Put you in the bed,
girl lick yo body real slow,
Goo Low
Girl I wanna be sipping (sipping)
on your sweet sweet water (water)
Its crunch time I bout to give you that 12 play...
This is the 4th quarter

Now some people take their time and some people pacrastinate
Some people bump and grind cause they with that 4 play
But its like that cream to me, lick it and roll it baby
Sex is like dope to me, so lets get it cracking baby
For instance you look like food, I wanna put you on my plate
Suck you up with some biscuits and go on and eat you baby
Up until you make it rain, grab my ears and pull my face
Tonight I’ll be giving you brain (gooooo low)

Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (gooooo Low)
Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (goooooo low)
Girl I just want to take yo clothes off,
Put you in the bed,
girl lick yo body real slow,
Goo Low
Girl I wanna be sipping (sipping)
on your sweet sweet water (water)
Its crunch time I bout to give you that 12 play...
This is the 4th quarter

Its like you a coach baby, put me in I goes hard
Cross it over in between, run it like a point guard
Girl my tongue got mad handles,
Come on coach just call my name
Shoot that thang and win that game
Gooooo low

Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (gooooo Low)
Baby I just wanna go low
I just wanna go low (goooooo low)
Girl I just want to take yo clothes off,
Put you in the bed,

Goo Low
Girl I wanna be sipping(sipping)
on your sweet sweet water(water)
Its crunch time I bout to give you that 12 play...
This is the 4th quarter
