Jupiter
Pluto
Venus and Saturn
I'm leaving Earth girl to explore your galaxy
Ten to zero
Blast off here we go
We'll be climax until we reach Mercury
Girl, Tell me are you ready girl
To take a trip out of this world
I guarantee you'll like it
It'll take your breath away
Gonna get you so excited
Once I've tasted your milky way
Girl spend the night come take a flight with me
Out into space

Girl you're sending me these sexual energies
And I gotta grab it
Right now I've gotta have it
Shooting stars, a trip to mars
I can get us there from where we are
So don't trip I got a giant rocket
Gliding through just hitting your pocket?

[Chorus:]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Ride in my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off babe (zoom)
Have a safe trip babe

Now it's just us both
I've got the control
In the middle of darkness
Girl relax and just flow
I'm about to tickle it and touch your soul
Once I enter into your black hole (baby uhh)

Girl now that you're next to me
We will be just like satellites
Watching over the Earth
We'll make space our paradise
Girl I promise this will be painless (painless)
We'll take a trip to planet Juranus
Uh just put your trust in me
And girl I promise destination
Will be a trip that you will never forget
I'm gonna take you out of this world
So hold on tight my dear
I'm about to take you out of here
And get you to my

[Chorus:]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Ride in my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off babe (zoom)
Have a safe trip babe

Oh

We'll stick a flag on the Moon
First couple to ever make love on planet Neptune (uuhh)
And if time allow us
We'll be gone for hours
I won't stop until I give you meteor showers
So if you want it say Uhh
And if you need it say uhh
If you really gotta have it say uhh
And you want me to take you to space

[Chorus: (2x)]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Ride in my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off babe (zoom)
Have a safe trip babe

So get ready for lift off babe
Get ready for lift off babe
