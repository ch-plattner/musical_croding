When he look her in the eyes and tell her
I love you, yeah
He seems so for real
When he whispers and says
I'll never leave you, no
And he speaks them words to her heart
And make her feel like she on top
Of the world, yeah, oh my
Then turn around and break her heart
And make her feel like the whole world's on top of her, whoa
And now something other made me talk about it

When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

How he promised her things
While he's making sweet love to her mind
Selling big dreams, yeah
That's what he do, or he can paint the scene
With every word out of his mouth
Make her wanna believe, oh she believes

That everything that he says is true
Now all the dreams she bought and the tales he told
Cinderella to the old pot of gold
Broke up for a heart and stole the glory
And it let me here to tell the story

When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

Hey now don't ya all shoot the messenger, nah, nah

Cause when a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, hey
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah.
