[1] - I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

Said I tried and tried again to keep you 
But it just ain't no use
I'm baffled cuz of what went down
See I got your letter so you're leaving town
Just take one minute to think about
Baby, lets back track on what happened in this house
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday
I came walkin' in four o'clock in the morning
And I thought you were sleepin' one eye opened
You turned and said to me where the hell you been
Then I turned it around and hollared with some friends drinking
And now I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh

Say the easiest thing in the world is to love you 
I love you baby
And the hardest thing in the world (So hard) 
Is to lose you (Is to lose you baby)

[2] - Now I'm sitting here sippin' on things 
I'm not suppose to (Sittin right here)
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)
I've got to get over losing you

Shattered I can't believe you're gone
I'm left in the middle of these four walls
Lying helpless 'bout to lose my mind baby
I can't fathom life without you by my side
Now every night before I go to sleep
I pray to heaven for a better me
Nights I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' 
You were at work I was at play
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake
I know I ain't got no right to say
But I need you to head on back this way
Because I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

Baby can't we just moan for love like we used to

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out
But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey
So I'm gonna get up out this chair
And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey
Because I love you babe
And i need you 
Right here by my side
Ghetto woman come on home to me
I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free
