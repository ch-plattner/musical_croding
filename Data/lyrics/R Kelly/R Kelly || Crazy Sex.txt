[Intro:]
Yeah, tonight is gonna be crazy
Yeah, baby, if you don’t mind

[Verse 1:]
Let’s get dumb, let’s get hyphy
Let’s get down, let’s get ugly
Let’s start sweating, let’s start tweaking
Screaming at the top of our lungs
Let’s get ignant, let’s get crazy
Let’s get rugged, let’s get blown
Let’s do it on a balcony, let everybody watch
We don’t care cause we in our zone
Go back in, get on the bed
Down on the floor, back up to the dresser
Calling me daddy, pulling your hair
Missing a track and don’t even care

[Pre-Hook:]
Let’s go deeper, let’s go faster, let’s go harder
Let’s cum at the same damn time and then start over

[Hook:]
Let’s have crazy sex
Are you with it, baby?
Crazy Sex
Are you with it, baby?
Crazy Sex, crazy Sex
Let’s have crazy sex
Are you with it, baby?
Crazy Sex
Are you with it, baby?
Crazy Sex, crazy Sex
Let’s get ratchet

[Verse 2:]
Let’s get rough, let’s get naughty
Let’s get different, let’s get kinky
Switch positions, you on top
Oh, girl, it’s about to get freaky
Let’s get sexy, let’s go twelve play
Let’s get scary, let’s go thriller
Let’s act like we lost our motherfucking minds
Making crazy faces in the mirror
Let’s make it a party, we’ll take some shots
Smoke some weed and thug it out
Let’s start fussing, let’s start cussing
Let’s start fighting and then make out

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
There’s so many crazy ways we can do it, babe
Pick one, pick ten, it just don’t matter, babe
Just step up in my room, let me get creative, babe
I’m gonna think of something, baby
I’m gonna think of something, baby
And it’s gonna be crazy

[Hook]
