
I was on my way
To getting close to you
Until you flipped the script on me
Another personality
I was just that close
To putting karats in your ring
Until I peeped your card
Now you threw it before you started baby

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

You were almost in
About to take you home with me
Until you opened up my eyes
And showed me your other side
You were inches from the room
Just about to take control
Now that I know it was all an act
I got to get that bracelet back

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

What made you think you could lie to me?
Baby and get away with it
Come back down to reality
When it comes to love you just don't get it

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

Having never lived like a lap full of g's
When all the time you was just try-na trap me
Closer, and closer, and closer to me
Trying to get rooted like the ground and trees
Now I wanna get tight like the harmonies
All you wanna do is just scheme, scheme, scheme
Riding in my gators sittin' on my things
Drinking and smoking up all my weed

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
