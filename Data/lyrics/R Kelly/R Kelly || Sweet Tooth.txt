This is for them big girls, smalls girls, tall girls
And this is for them skinny girls, white girls, black girls
Don't matta the color or the nationality
I got a sweet tooth come and get with me.

When I saw you at the club girl leanin and rocking with it
Ooo you made a nigga wanna giggle wit it.
Let me put in the back of the coupe and hit it.
And now all I wanna do is babysit it
I've been feenin wanna kiss it
Hungry girl let me raid yo kitchen
Fix me a plate of that...
I'm not playin girl i'm on a mission
Legs won't stop shaking once i do it (ah ah)
Tongue game tight girl let me do it (uh huh)
Tease you then please you girl
Open up let me in your world

Girl I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth

[Chorus:]
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
oooh it taste like skittles

I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl I got a sweet tooth

Now I got you on my bed 
Clothes off
Lying next to me
Girl I'm bout to give myself a cavity
Plus I'm gonna need bandaids for my knees
Gril set the table and let me feast
Strawberry shortcake wit whipped cream
I can taste it
My mouth is watering for you
Come here girl let me show you
Hop in the range
Slide thru
All up in yo crib
Toss you
When its over
I want more of you
So open up 
Let me spoil you

Girl I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth

[Chorus:]
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
oooh it taste like skittles

[Bridge:]
I don't want no dinner babe
I'm going straight for dessert
You don't need no panties babe
Girl up under that t-shirt

Look it taste so good to me 
And, I can't get enoughh
See, doc say stay away from sweets, fuck it
I'm gonna get my sugar up

[Chorus: repeat until the end]
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
oooh it taste like skittles

I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl I got a sweet tooth
[repeat until the end]
