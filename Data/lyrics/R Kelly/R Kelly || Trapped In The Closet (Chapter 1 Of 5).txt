
Seven o'clock in the morning 
And the rays from the sun wakes me 
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me 
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom 
Then she comes out and kisses me 
And to my surprise, she ain't you 

Now I've got this dumb look on my face 
Like, what have I done? 
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun? 
Must of lost the track of time 
Oh, what was on my mind? 
From the club, went to her home 
Didn't plan to stay that long 

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes 
Searching for my car keys 
Tryin' to get on up out the door 
Then she streched her hands in front of it 
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy 
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs 

"Shh, shh, quiet 
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor" 
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out 
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house 

Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
He walks in there with a smile on his face 
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him 
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water"
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar 

Throws her in the bed 
And start to snatchin' her clothes off 
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on? 
You're not gonna believe it 
But things get deeper as the story goes on 
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone 
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate 
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late 
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet"

He walks in the bathroom 
And looks behind the door 
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch, say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain 
While she's biting her nails 
Then he walks back to the room 
Right now, I'm sweating like hell 
Checks under the bed 
Then under the dresser 
He looks at the closet 
I pull out my Beretta 
He walks up to the closet 
He comes up to the closet 
Now he's at the closet 
Now he's opening the closet...
