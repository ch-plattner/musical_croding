
Lately you're be acting strange towards me baby
And your heart seems to grown straight cold
You used to laugh at everything I said baby
Now you play me like my jokes are old

[Chorus:]
And girl we used to talk about everything
Like make love until we're old and grey
And all these photo... I took
You don't give me the same love
And when I ask you, you say everything is ok
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house
Cause you're distance brings the worst of you
It's like a battle of silence... for
Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you

[Chorus]

I remember we used to make love through the night
And we we're doing it 'til the morning light
... put you are not there

Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong
[x2]
