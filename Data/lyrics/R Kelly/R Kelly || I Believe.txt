
In small towns, and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans and independents
To stand up and say that we are
One nation, we are one people
And out time for change has come!

Hey! Hey! Woah! Hey! Hey!

I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I

When the mountain seem to high (high, high)
And you dont have the courage nor strength to climb
And the road youre on wont end
But still you run, though you cannot see the finish line
And dark clouds are over you
Your skies no longer blue
But you marched on straight ahead
Somehow you made it through
Got to the mountain
They left a path for me
Your victory made history and now

I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe
Ohh I

When it felt like you were weak
And couldnt fight no more (fight no more)
On the ropes and it seemed like you was gonna run out of breath (run out of breath)
When the world was on your shoulder
And the walls were in your way
You leaped and made it over
Through it all you kept the faith
With hope you set as free,
You showed us how to dream
And now we can lift our voices and forever sing
Nows the time to look ahead
And thank our heros of the past
And celebrate this victory, lets raise the flag cause

I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I

And when they tried to keep you down
You kept up your head
Never loosing sight
You believed in what was right
You endured to the end
Walked through the strongest wind
The storms over and a new day begins
And when our hope was dying
You bought as healing
And now I got something, to tell my children

I believe!!, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,
Ohh I believe, I believe, I believe,

Yeah

I believe!!, I believe, I believe,
Yeah, yeah
Oh I believe, I believe, I believe

I believe that a change is gonna come
Yes it will, yes it will
See I believe in the future
That a change is coming to America
So stand up, stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Lift every voice and sing
Hey!

[Chorus/Playing in background]

That the soldiers are coming home, yeah
That it wont be long
That a change is gonna come
Say it
I believe
