A piece of this pie

And I could be your guy

Like I'm your teddy bear
There isn't that nice
You'll have no fear yo

And make me melt like butter
When it comes to sayin' I love you

I'll turn you on like a neon light
Make everything alright
Like in the middle of the night
Yo when you need somebody to love you

Kiss and caress you and hold you
And my word is born
Yo P. A.
