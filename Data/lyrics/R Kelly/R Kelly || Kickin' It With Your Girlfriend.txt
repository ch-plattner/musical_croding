[CHORUS]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend

[VERSE 1]
Go on and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wasting your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempting and teasing me
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2]
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feeling her
And how we would get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to mislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where ever since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
I'm sorry again
Never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry again
But girl I love her
I'm sorry again
I never meant to make you cry, no
The first one out the closet

[CHORUS 2X]
