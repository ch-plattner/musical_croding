
This might sound strange, this might sound strange to you, to you
I found someone that might just changed my life, yeah
I know, cause she's always on my mind, every night

[Chorus:]
I don't even know her name
I've never seen you up here before
I love what she do
I'm so into you
Cause I love the DJ
I Love the DJ, she's so sexy
I Love the DJ
I Love the DJ, wow wow

It turns me on when you spinning those records for me
I wanna come right up there and grab hold of your body
When ever you here, I know that you gonna play my favourate song tonight
I can feel you working on my mind, you are so fine

[Chorus:]
I don't even know her name
I've never seen you up here before
I love what she do
I'm so into you
Cause I love the DJ
I Love the DJ, she's so sexy
I Love the DJ
I Love the DJ, wow wow

Now you gonna slow down, slow it down, slow it down
For all the lovers in the building yeah
Slow it down, slow it down
Girl we will be in the club forever

Cause I love the DJ
I love the DJ, she's so sexy
I love the DJ
I love the DJ wow wow
