How many of you can step?
Who can step? Can you step?
Can you really step? Can you cut a rug?
Aight, so what we gonna do is slow it down
And see if you can step to this one
Another one for the ladies 
Coming from the Chocolate Factory
It's the piper ya'll
Your music weatherman

I can't wait 'til I hit the door
Can't wait 'til your clothes hit the floor
I want you so bad, my pretty baby
Oh, baby, you should know how I feel
When it comes down to making love with you (woah)
So come on (come on), lets get on this plane of love baby
And fly through the night
And our destination is wherever your spot is baby (oh baby)
And woman please believe me I'm gonna drive you crazy, so

Welcome to (welcome to) the greatest show on Earth (the greatest show)
Welcome baby, to my bedroom girl (hello)
Welcome to the greatest show on Earth
Girl welcome to the greatest show on earth
What you're about to witness
Is unheard...

I'll be kissing places on you (kissing you baby)
All the way from your head to toe and everything in between
I promise to keep you a happy camper
While we make history (Lord have mercy)
Tonight we'll rescue love and set it free
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
Oh baby, tonight we'll reach the skies
Just you and me girl, 'cause
All I want, all I need, is you here loving me tonight, girl
So come on (come on) and let's get on this plane of love baby
We'll fly through the night (girl through the night)
And our destination is wherever your spot is baby (oh baby)
And I guarantee (my body) I'm gonna drive you crazy
Girl like a circus when it comes to town
(So many bills in my switch, flips and tricks, in places all around)
Oh baby come on, girl
I'll be kissing you, baby up and down
Giving it to you round and round
So...

Welcome to (welcome to the greatest) the greatest show on Earth 
(Welcome baby baby to my, girl to my bedroom)
Welcome to (welcome to the greatest) the greatest show on Earth
Baby welcome to the greatest show
Hope you will enjoy, just sit back and relax 
I'm gonna try and make this one hell of a night you wont forget
What you are about to witness is unheard
So welcome to the greatest...... woah....show on Earth

And the love lines are open and we want you to call us at
