Did you get my card?
Did you read my love letter?
Did it touch your heart?
When you read my love letter

Sunny days, smiling face
Spirit filled, heaven praise
Memories in my mind
Reminiscing of good times
Miracles, so amazed
Soldiers far away
It makes me ask the question baby

Did you get my card?
(Huh)
Did you read my love letter?
(Yeah)
Did it touch your heart?
(Yeah yeah)
When you read my love letter
(When you read my love letter)

Weekends and birthdays
Celebrations, holidays
Love making history
A toast to our victories
Sweet dreams, butterflies
Holding hands, side by side
Best friends, families
Reminds me

Did you get my card? (my card)
(Did you get my card girl?)
Did you read my love letter?
(Tell me did you read my love letter?)
Did it touch your heart?

I hope these,
Hope these words find you in the perfect mood
I wrote this letter according to my love for you
So I hope this paper will travel safely to where you are
Because the melody is custom made for your heart
Though near or far I will find a way to send my love
Only pray that it don't come back return to sender
If you are reading this I hope that things are well
And you can text me back, you can write me back
Just check your mail
