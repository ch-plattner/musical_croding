[1] - All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl I wanna spend it with you 
I want you with me babe
Here's life without you

Baby, through all the ups and down
You were a lady
I wanna show you how I love you
Baby, deserve the very best
And I, I'll give it to you, only you
How can I show you that 
Only you satisfy everything that you do
Baby girl, anything that you want
I'll give to you 
Just promise me forever, boo

[Repeat 1]

Baby I can't imagine life without you
With me, I never want to be without you
Baby, I want you to believe it's true 
All that I do, I do for you
How can I show you that
Only you could satisfy, everything that you do
Anything that you want I'll give to you 
Just promise me forever, boo

[Repeat 1]

Don't know why you stayed by my side for so long
So I dedicate baby, in every way 
All my heart and soul
It all belongs to you

[Repeat 1 until fade]
