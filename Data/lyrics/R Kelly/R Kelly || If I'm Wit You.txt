
I don't understand
I do all this for you
You contemplating on me
Or is it him 
Or is it me
Or is it him
He told you he'd be there for you 
And he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you
And I was
And still is the real is 
Who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments
And got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy 
To give you everything
But if you're real then
You can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib
Off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter
Who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I';m up on my game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

Ooh baby, I want you here with me
And give you everything 
That your heart desires
Lady can you feel me 
Do you wanna be with me for always
Baby can't you see 
What you do to me
when he do the things that he has done to you baby

[1] - You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
Cuz I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby

Now who took you in when that nigga put you out
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Baby, can't you see
What you do to me
When he do the things he do to you, baby

[Repeat 1 until fade]
