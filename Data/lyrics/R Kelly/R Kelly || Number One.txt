[R. Kelly] 
A lot of these cats out here be fakin 
When it comes to makin love 
But you and me baby 
This is real... 
And that's why it's... 

[Chorus] 

(Number one) 
Sex that we're having 
Here girl 
Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
Sex that we're having here girl 
You better ask somebody.. 

[R. Kelly] 
Can't nobody do it like us 
Can't nobody mix chop and screw it like us 
All over the living room hittin it like us 
In the middle of the night wake up the building like us 
But it's oookay if you wanna brag 
The sex so good 
Go and pat yourself on the back 
And them haaaters, they gon hate 
But we just gon keep on blowing up cause girl 
They gon hate, anyway 
You are now rocking with the best (best, best, best...) 
I'll make you forget about the rest 
Having sex with you is like makin hits 
Girl we got egos they can't tell us that we ain't the shit 
I'm in your mix like a number one record 
And the beat goes on and on 
And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day 
And i love it when you take me down and make me say-ay.. 

[Chorus] 
(Number one) 
Sex that we're having 
Here girl 
Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
Sex that we're having here girl, ohh 

Keri! 

[Keri Hilson] 
You know you stay at the top spot 
When you're breaking me down like a chop shop, eh 
Cutting like some blades on a caddy 
That's how you're working me, daddy 
Everytime you put that on 
You are now rocking with the best 
I'll make you forget about your ex 
This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first 
I know what i'm doing ain't no need to rehearse yeah-ee-yeah 
A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast 
But you be steady cruising like you want it to last 
That's how you made me a chocoholic 
And right now my body's calling 
I gotta know how you got the knowhow 
Baby you the champ of all that goes down 
If your -- was a gun it would stone cold? 
With my RNB thug when I bang bang 
You know Kells and Keri hook up like that you make it number one 

[Chorus] 
(Number one) 
Sex that we're having 
Here girl 
Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
Sex that we're having here girl, ohh 

[R. Kelly] 
Hands down you the best 
Ain't no competition 
You and me in this bed 
Just what I was wishin 
Them other girls was cool but it's somethin they was missin 
And i don't call them back every since we hit it in the kitchen 
That night 
At my home 
Trench coat 
Nothin on 
Your sex 
Got me gone 
Went straight 
To my dome 
And i love it woo 
Girl i love it woo 
And i love it woo 
Girl i love it woo 
Girl it's somethin about you that thrills me 
That's why after we lay you get to know the real me-e-e-yeah 
And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day
And i love it when you take me down and make me say 
Eyyyyyy 

[Chorus] 
(Number one) 
Sex that we're having 
Here girl 
Ooh (this is, this is number one) 
Sex that we're having here girl, ohh 

[R. Kelly] 
Girl i vow that I would do anything to pleasure you 
All I wanna do is make this last 
I'll kiss you up I kiss you down 
Be real quiet or making sounds 
Take it slow or take it fast 
And wooo 
And wee 
And yoouuu 
And me 
Havin fun 
And when it's over in the morning i'll say gracias baby 
Before you go I'll scream damelo 

(Num-num-number one, number one 
This is, this is number one)
