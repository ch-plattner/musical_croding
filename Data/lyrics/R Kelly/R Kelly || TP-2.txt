Hit it hard from the back
Roll around on the front
I know you've heard a lot of tracks
But 12 Play is what you want
Just let me call the studio
Then we can go all night
Girl I hope you can hang
Cause I'm horny as hell tonight

One
Taking off your Secrets with my teeth
Two 
Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky
Three
Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom
Four
Now open your eyes 
Surprise you've entered twelve play two

Stop
We need to catch our breath
We've been going for a while
It's been about two hours
And we're still going round for round
The water's getting cold
And the movie's going off
This is how we do in TP-2

Five 
I'm about to take you for a ride
Now feel it come inside
Six
Baby it's as hard as a brick
Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh
Seven
That's when to slow it down
Cause I'm not ready to
Eight
We're almost at the peak
Cause I'm feeling tingly

Now flew your body like, what (what, what)
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)
The hottest out of your friends
The way you take it from me
Girl you put it on me like draws
Moaning when you talk
I'm about to tear your shit out
New millennium style

Nine
Lookin' you in your eyes
As I'm about to do that thing
Ten
Then on down to your thighs 
I'm gonna make you scream
Eleven
Now put your body on top of me
I'm about to grab your waist
Twelve 
Now quick before we get to thirteen
Set it on my face
