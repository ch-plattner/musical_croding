I can see the colors of the rainbow
And I can feel the sun on my face
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And I can feel heaven in it's place

And that's the sign of a victory [x2]

I can feel the spirit of the nations
And I can feel my wings ridin' the winds, yeah
I see the finish line just up ahead now
And I can feel it risin' deep within

And that's the sign of a victory [x2]

Now I can see the distance of the journey
High and front with all your might
You open your eyes to global warming
Been through it all, you sacrificed your life

And that's the sign of a victory [x2]

If we believe, we can achieve anything
Including the impossible, this I know
So let's lift up our heads, yeah
And raise the flag, yeah yeah
And scream like you want to win
Now let the games begin!

That's the sign of a victory [x4]

When you keep on fightin'
After you lost your strength
That's the sign of a victory

When darkness is all around you
You still find your way
That's the sign of a victory

Come on and sing
Lift up your voice and sing
Stand up, oh yeah, stand up
The sign of a victory
Ooooohh ohh ohhhh
That's the sign of a victory
