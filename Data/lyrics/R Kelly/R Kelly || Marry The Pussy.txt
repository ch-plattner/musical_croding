I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
Wanna go down on my knees, ask that pussy to marry me
Pussy a sight for sore eyes, my best friend, my better half 
Been good to me, its love to me, can't explain what it do to me
Pussy talk to me, pussy sing to me
So much joy it bring to me
When I call the pussy, it come right away
And I call the pussy like everyday
I love pussy and pussy love me
I can tell the way it strip for me
If I'm ever in the mood for two pussies
Then the pussy will bring another pussy to me

This is a sex proposal
I just wanna marry the pussy
I just wanna marry the pussy
(Pussy will you marry me?)
I just wanna marry the pussy
Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

Pussy been so sweet to me
It feeds me, so good to me
Always open up to me, it moans for me and it cries to me
Pussy's there when I fall asleep
Let's me know that it belongs to me
And I love the way that pussy screams when it tells me I'm so freaky
I want the (plans?) to this pussy
Because this pussy is the best pussy
Baby we put on a tux, break out a ring
Because this pussy is the realest pussy (to me)

This is a sex proposal
I just wanna marry the pussy
I just wanna marry the pussy
(Pussy would you marry me, please?)
I just wanna marry the pussy
(I wanna go down)
Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

Yeah I spank that pussy like it's so naughty
And I drive that pussy crazy, that's my Bugatti
Make that pussy hot and wet, that's Miami climate
Tongue down her landing strip, no auto-pilot
Yeah, eat that pussy, kiss that pussy
Beat that pussy like I own that pussy
Get in that pussy, drill that pussy
Make her love come down til I drown that pussy
And I take my time in it, that's the scenic route
Sex trainer, I work pussy out
Tell her pop that pussy like you're from the south
Swear the pussy so good she got a nigga writin' vows

I just wanna marry the pussy
(I just wanna marry the pussy)
I just wanna marry the pussy
(Down on my knees with a ring yeah)
I just wanna marry the pussy
(All those times that I was horny)
Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

Yeah, would you marry me pussy? Would ya?
Would you marry me pussy? Yeah
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Goin' down on my knees, marry me pussy
Goin' down on my knees, marry me pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
