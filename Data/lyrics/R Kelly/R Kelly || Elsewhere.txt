Seems like we're done here 
Looks like that's everything 
She walks by, one last time, checks for her things and leave the keys behind 
There will be more tears 
As she's beginning to drive away 
Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain 
Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here 
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine 

But she'll be going elsewhere 
And she'll be lying else where 
And she'll be wanted elsewhere 
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
And she'll be living elsewhere 
And she'll be laughing elsewhere 
And shell be happy elsewhere 
And I'll be just fine without her, someday 

That's what I keep telling myself 

Was it the right thing 
Was this our biggest mistake 
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say,
And still she stays away 
It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her 
How could she, Why would she 
Do these things put me through this pain now 
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad 
That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try 

But she'll be trying elsewhere 
And she'll be loving elsewhere 
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere 
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
And shell be willing elsewhere 
And shell be giving elsewhere 
And she'll have feelings elsewhere 
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it 

But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think 
There's so many things in my head 
Things she said, things that she meant 
Things that I started feeling the day that she left 
Things that I slept on 
Things that I should have accepted 
Things I expected and the things I neglected 
I better get up off my ass 
Get first flight out, and get her back 

Or else 

She'll be living elsewhere 
And she'll be crying elsewhere 
And shell be feeling elsewhere 
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her 
She'll be smiling elsewhere 
And she'll be laughing elsewhere 
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere 
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight 
?I'm out of time?
