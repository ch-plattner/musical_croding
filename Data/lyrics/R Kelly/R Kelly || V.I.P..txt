
Rock on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Chillin' at the club
Showing niggas how we ball
Ever since the drought
It's been nothing but the trump

Can you really blame me for getting these G's
Something I don't understand
Why you fools after me, VIP
Got the haters after me
Cuz I push these V's
They wanna be like me
If you agree
Then raise the roof with me
In the party place to be
Living VIP

Since when did money, oh
Become such a problem
I just wanna live a life
That only involve the numbers, yeah

Can you really blame me for getting these G's
See what I can't understand
Why you fools don't rock with me, VIP
I got the haters after me 
Because I push these V's
They wanna be like me
If you agree (If you agree)
Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me)
In the party place to be (In the party place to be)
Living VIP 

[Tone]
Ha ha, nothing but the
Stretch Bentleys with the top thats drop, that's right
Kelly CD's with the sound that knocks
Di di di di di di di
When the party rocks
Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin but rocks
I know you haters wanna come to Rockland's party
But you can't get in unless you VIP

Can you really blame me for getting these G's
See what I can't understand
Why you fools are after me, livin' V
So if you're ballin' and you know, raise your hands
And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet
And if your man ain't spendin' money on you
Then ladies, you can come and get with me
A little V

[R]
Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters
I mean, I wish I could make a phone call 
To all the haters around the world
You know what I'm saying?
This is what I'd say
What's goin' on in the world today, huh?
Seems like every nigga got beef cuz they ain't got steak 
When I ain't had no money see, everything was cool
But now that I got a little money and y'all wanna act a fool
And none of 'em VIP

VIP, I got the haters after me
Because I push these V's (What?)
They wanna be like me (Raise the roof, y'all)
If you agree (Now let's lock)
And raise the roof with me
(Over this here's, just bring it on)
In the party place (Uh, Rockland)
To be living VIP, VIP

I got the haters after me
Because I push these V's
They wanna be like me
(Wanna be a.....)
