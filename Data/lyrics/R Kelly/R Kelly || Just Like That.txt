Oh baby,
If I could explain the joy I feel .......

Oooh If I could explain the joy I feel 
All this love makin is oh so real 
Oooh like winter time by the fireplace
Oooh like traped in walls and its no escape
Oooh like a precious jewel with no price tag 
Oooh like waterfalls comin' down on me
Oooh like tidal wave comin' from the sea
Oooh like a favorite scene in a big movie

You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Ooooooh)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Ooooh Just like)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby 

Oooh like you and me makin' history baby
Oooh like a 99th anniversary 
Oooh like a baby when it speaks its first words
Oooh like an uplifting song the first time heard 
Oooh like a shelter when the storm gets ruff
Oooh like a mountain top from the bottom up 
Oooh like an expensive suite at the best hotel 
Oooh like a work of art when its unvailed 

You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (like that )
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (oh oh oh oh oh, if you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (just like that yeah)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that (Ooooh)

Oooh like a great blue sky's on a summer day
Oooh like sittin close in a small cafe
Oooh like makin love to someone you love 
Oooh like breakin up then makin up 
Oooh like a warm embrace when you come around 
Oooh like the sweetest words when your feelin down
Oooh like lost inside of a masquerade 
Oooh like a celebration in a big parade 
Oooh like a secret told to the one you trust 
Oooh like kissin you in a all white tux

You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like that, if you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like that)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that 

Like the moon, yeah when it glows at night, 
and like the sun oh yeah when it shines real bright,
and just like the ocean when the well comes high,
Like an eagle when it soars the sky
