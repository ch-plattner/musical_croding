
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

Take your time, we got all night
Trust in me I'm gonna get it right
Whatever's on, take it off
I wanna get inside with you baby and get lost

And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
Cause we'll be...

Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

The way we touch, the way we kiss
Oh girl I love it when it feels like this
Just forget what you had to do
Cause the night is all about me and you

And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
Cause we'll be...

Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

So open the window baby
I don't care if the world hears us baby
Cause as long as you're here lying next to me
Girl, we can lay on the floor
Don't need any privacy

Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
