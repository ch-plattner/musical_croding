[Intro]
Yeah, like I was saying
I ain't, ya know what
I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you
You know what I'm saying
I don't wanna hurt you, baby
Just sometimes you do things 
That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you
You know I care about you
This time, you just brought it on yourself
Yo, check it out

Now I shoulda been more man
About the way things went down
Especially since we been dealin' 
For like seven years now
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down
No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way
To love me somehow
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow
Got my faces, some ice and a tie
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down

(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you 
(I don't mean it) When I say that we're through 
(I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through 
(I don't mean it) Baby 
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry 
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me
(I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning 
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it

Running around here talking about 
How I'm a big player now
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share
Kelly makin' hits now
Thinking about this industry 
And how I put it out
You were there for me 
When I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you
I was talkin' too loud
When I didn't come home
I was hanging with the crowd
Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now

(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, I
(I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin'
(I don't mean it) Ooh I don't mean it

[R.] Father, can you help me?
[Priest]What do you need from me?
[R.] I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely
[Priest]I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly
You been so demanding
You need to read my word, son
And get some understanding
[R.] But I been busy with my music
[Priest]Stop making excuses
Recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it
[R.] Is it too late to get her back?
[Priest]Not as long as I'm a fact
[R.] Well father, show me a sign
That will make her mine

(I don't mean it) I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) Or whenever I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby
(I don't mean it) See what was straight is now stone
(I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh
(I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) I put it on my life
(I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out
(I don't mean it) You reached out your hand
(I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman
(I don't mean it) To raise a man
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby
(I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you baby
