
Girl you just don't know
Last night was incredible
Yes
Check it out

Last night I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven (uh)
Last night I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together (uh yeah)
Last night I heard an angel speak to me it said us forever (ooh yeah)
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

[Chorus]
Last night I touched a dream
When you were here with me 
Last night I touched a dream
Girl you fulfilled my fantasy
Touched a dream
Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night I could a sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings (spread his wings)
Last night I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing (ooh yeah)
Last night I saw the world living in peace and harmony (whooo)
While we were making love, felt my soul beating set free

[Chorus]
Last night touched a dream (yeah, yeah) 
You were here with me 
Last night I touched a dream (whooo)
You fulfilled my fantasy (yeah)
Touched a dream
I Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream (oh yeah)
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

After the rain comes the rainbow (yeah)
The sun will shine after the storm, oh yes it will
(and mother nature gaurantees it, yeah)
Jump the mountain and touch the sky (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Over the sea baby we can fly
When we make love I see the flowers, the trees, the birds, the bee's
Last night I touched a dream

[Chorus]

la la la la la, la la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la

la la la la la, la la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la

la la la la la, la la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la

la la la la la, la la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la

Baby we rewrote the book of love making history
Forever I have a dream 
A vision of you right there with me 
I know your my love making queen 
And I am your love making king
Let no man or woman come between 
What God have given you and me
The laws of reciprocities
And give them amorosity
Provided us with food to eat
Fulfills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry
Forever anniversaries
You're the root to my tree, I'm a branch you're a leaf
The apple carrying my seed
Fall, winter, summer, spring
That's why I ain't gon' let the devil steal my joy from me cause I done (oh, oh)
