When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done;
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)
Lord, You were my company

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
I feel strength (when I think about you)
No pain (when I think about you)
And no rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
And raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)

And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart
Lord you gave me a brand new start

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength (when I think about you)
There is no pain (when I think about you)
No rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
Raise my hands (when I think about you)
And shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord
(When I think about you)

Listen
Even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up

I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)
There's no rain (when I think about you)
No more pain (when I think about you)
I get glad, ohh (when I think about you)
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) oh I
(When I think about you)
I feel joy (when I think about you)
And peace (when I think about you)
Feel your presence (when I think about you)
Coming over me (when I think about you)
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)
Down to my knees (when I think about you)
And begin to pray (when I think about you) Lord help me
(When I think about you)
Then I see the light (when I think about you)
Startin' to shine right through (when I think about you)
It's a brand new day (when I think about you)
And my heart's renewed (when I think about you)
And all my fears are gone (when I think about you)
Away (when I think about you)
When my day looks cloudy (when I think about you)
It's gonna be okay (When I think about you)
Yeah-ohh-no (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)
How you gave me love (gave me love) (when I think about you)
And I gave you nothing (gave you nothing) (when I think about you)
How you woke me up (hey!) (when I think about you)
And started me on my way (started me on my way) (when I think about you)
See you did not have to do it (when I think about you)
But you did it any old way (when I think about you)
Any old, any old, any old way (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did, (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey whoo
Oh yes (uh) (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)
(When I think about you)
(When I think about you)
