Seems like the more I climb the hill gets deeper
And the more I rise see I get deeper
It's like the more I give see the more is taken
And the more I'm loved the more I'm hated
Still the more I fall the more I'll get up
And keep on driving when the road gets tough
And I won't stop till I get what's mine
But un till then
See I'm tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin in a change
Putting out the fire indure it to the end
They will come and I will shout victory

Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin in a change
Putting out the fire in dure to the end
They will come and I will shout victory

Seems like the more I win the more I loose
The more my minds made up the more I'm confused
It's like the more that I search the more I get lost
And just when I get on seems like I fall off
But the more it rains the more I pray
Cause I know tomorrow will bring a brighter day
So I won't stop till I get what's mine
But un till then
I'm tearing down theese walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin in a change
Putting out the fire in dure it to the end
They will come and I will shout victory
I'm tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin in a change
Putting out the fire in dure it end
They will come and I will shout victory

When the morning comes I will rise
There a angel for me in the sky
As long as heavens right by my side

I'm tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leavin' in a change
Putting out the fire in dure it to the end
They will come and I will shout victory
[repeat till end]
