Oh yeah, listen
I used to say I'll never let a woman break my heart, no na na
And I used to say I'll let no girl leave me scars
I was so, so proud
Cause in the mist of us breaking up
Uh baby I talk like, I was so, so tough
Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl,
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah,
And I don't mind

I used to tell my friends no girl could ever break me down
Oh no, no, ah
No girl is sweet enough to ever turn my world around
And you changed my mind
Cause every time I walk out of the door
Uh baby, I yell out, I ain't coming back no more
Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl,
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah,
And I don't mind, I don't mind

And I don't care what my friends have to say
Baby... feeling this way, oh no
Whatever the cost, I'm willing to pay
Cause I can't see me walking away
I'm your baby, girl
Oh, yeah, whoa, no, na na, baby
Na na baby,

I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl,
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah,
And I don't mind, cause your loving's just hat good baby
Uh, my friends say I'm crazy
But I'm crazy about you baby
Yes I am, I guess it's my honey
That's why your love keeps me running, for you baby
I'm a fool, for you baby
I'm a fool, yeah, for you baby
For my baby, baby, baby.
