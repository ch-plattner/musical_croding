Rolling coming out them fruity color candy doors
Rolling catch me hopping up and down on 24's
Rolling hey watch me Rollin Hey, Watch me Rollin Hey, Watch me rolling
Rolling When I was down you Bitches didn't want to be my friend
Rolling and Now I'm rolling now you bitches want to hop in 
Rolling Hey Watch me Rolling Hey, Watch me rolling hey, what me rolling

[Verse]
I'm going toot, toot, beep, beep, pulling up on them wheels now
All black on black body got it shining much like a seal now
Got them cars in my garage no less than a mill now
Kells about to take the bar and set it real high
Double take Double take when I roll up to the club
Playas they plays us when I walk up in the club
I got them shades doing about 75 
Just call it speed racer cause I'm rolling in that marc 5
Yall niggas aint fucking with me and I put a mill on it
Niggas and Bitches they lie but home boy them stacks don't 
R&B Boss hustling like Rick Ross
Man my flow is so raw niggas don't piss me off
I'm a playa homie and that's a well known factor
Plus the wheels on the coupe got lookin like a tractor
Take my ice hold it up
Then my city toss it up
Chi-town summer time kells got traffic backed up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yellow ice cash money I got cash money
Just to hear them horses go vroom I spent that cash money
As for the hatas they as funny 
My money like a road block so watch how you roll you fucking crash dummy
I rolling in, I rolling and bounce, I roll and stop
I roll slow motion and I let the beat drop
Honies love it when I roll up on them wheels
Top down clowning on the wheels
I got them 24s on the coupe you know they chop and spin
I put a S on my Maybox cause thats my super benz
I own the night light shining when I roll through
Hop out that Zaradie 101 call it smurf blue
Silver bullet lex Jeep parked out at my beach home
Think I'm from a swamp the way I step out with them gators on
On the hood in that old school I be smoking trees on it
Just got a Cadillac I'm about to throw some D's on it

[Hook]
[Break Down]
Sh sh sh shawty do you wanna ride in that GT with me 
Sh sh sh Shawty don't you wanna ride on them 23's

[Hook to the end]
