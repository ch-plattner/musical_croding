
It's a new day and I feel good
If I wanna spread my wings
I know that I could
I got a feeling that tonight begins
A healing where we all win

I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks

Laa da diee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo

I feel emotions deep inside my bones
Like an ocean when the wave gets strong
I feel today is my victory
I gotta get out there and make history

I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
(said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks

Laa da wiee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo

I had a vision, it was real to me
Like a new song and my heart that sings
Just like the striking of a lightning ball
I feel the power of a miracle

I can see the fireworks (oohw)
I can see the fireworks (fireworks)
I can see the firewooorks
(said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
(fireworks, fireworks, fireworks)

Said the sky is glowing with peace love and harmony
These days is runnin with joy cause there's been a victoryyyy

I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
(said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
(across the sky, over the water, throughout the city)

I can see the fireworks (hey)
I can see the fireworks
(I can see the fireworks)
I can see the firewooorks
(ooh, like a rainbow)
I can see the fireworks
I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks

Laa da diee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo [x2]
