Well...
Now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin' in a mirror
She yells honey let me explain
He says you don’t have to go no further
I can clearly see what's goin' on
Behind my back, in my bed, in my home
Then I said wait a minute now hold on
I said mister we can work this out
She said honey don’t lose control
Tried to get him to calm down
He said ho I should’ve known
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house
But the Christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt
I said we need to resolve this
Then he stepped to me, I’m like whoa
There’s a reason I’m in this closet
He says, yeah like what, are you talkin' clothes
I met this girl at the Paje's club
And she told me she didn’t have a man
Then he said man please,
I’d kill you if you didn’t have that gun in ya hand
And I said but yo chick chose me
He said don’t give me that mack shit please
His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer
I point my gun and says I’m not the one you after
He says somethin' I bet you didn't know my man
Did she tell you that I was a pastor
I said well good that’s betta right
Why can’t we handle this Christian- like
And I started to put the gun down
'Til I saw his face still had a frown
She started cryin', sayin' baby I'm sorry
Then he said baby not as sorry as you’re gonna be
I started inchin' out
He says no I want you to see this
Said I gotta get out this house
He said not 'til I reveal my secret
I'm like what is goin' on inside his head
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says
Hello, Baby, turn the car around
Listen I just need for you to get right back here now (Click)
He looks at me and says well since we're all comin' out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that's broken hearted
She said what do you mean
And he said just wait and see
I said somebody betta talk to me
And then his phone rang
He picks up and somebody says sweetheart I’m downstairs
And he’s like I’ll buzz you up
I’m on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs
And I’m like who is this mystery lady that you’re talking to
He says in time you both will know the shockin' truth
Baby this is something I been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time
Then I said, "Nigga, I'mma shoot you both if you don’t say what’s on ya mind
He said wait I hear somebody comin' up the stairs
And I'm lookin' at the door
He says I think you betta sit down in the chair
I says I’m gonna count to four
1, he says mister wait
2, she says please don’t shoot
3, he says don’t shoot me
4, she screams
Then a knock at the door, the guns in my hands
He opens the door, I can't believe - it's a man
