
The storm is over, and I'm so glad the sun is shining

Confusion everywhere, without a clou on how to make things beter
A toast to the man upstairs, 'cause he puts the peaces back togheter

Now let's step to a new tune,
Cause everything is o.k.
You're alright, and I'm alright
Well, let's celebrate

What a relief to know that, we are one
What a relief to know that, the war is over
What a relief to know that, there is an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still a lie

Although we struggle, know that help is on the way, yeah
The power of love, we can not under estimate, no
Seems like you're gonna break, and there is no escape, you still got to have faith, yeah
And know that love, is gonna step up to the plate

Now let's step to a brand new tune,
'Cause everything is o.k.
You're alright, and I'm alright
Oeehh, so let's celebrate

What a relief to know that, we are one
What a relief to know that, the war is over
What a relief to know that, there is an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still a lie

Listen,
See I'm just trying to bring relief for those who need it
Somebody help somebody, now go and repeat it
Understand that struggle has no colors
See, we all got our stormy weather,
That's all the more reason why we should join hands and pull it together

So take a deep breath and grap somebody and hit the floor

What a relief to know that, we are one
What a relief to know that, the war is over
What a relief to know that, there is an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still a lie

What a relief to know that, we are one
What a relief to know that, the war is over
What a relief to know that, there is an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still a lie
