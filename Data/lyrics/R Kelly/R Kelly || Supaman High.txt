Jump out, girls like damn that's them? 
Drop dead coupe, drop top Benz, 
Me and your friends, can all be friends, 
Walk through the club, smoke in the wind, 
Just played Superman, they playin it again, 
From the "A" to the Chi, to the West Coast, 
Superman flight flyin' to the East Coast, 
Wonder Woman braclet, Murp flinstone, 
Jelly Bean diamonds, crazy ice on, 
Superman geeked up, 'lac truck rimmed up, 
Superman rich-high Scottie just beamed up,
