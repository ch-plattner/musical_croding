
There is strength deep inside me that I never knew I had 
There's a fire within burnin' bright 
There is a love inside of me that I never thought I'd feel 
Until the day you came into my life, yeah 

And it was you that were there when no one else was 
And you show me a love unknown, ooh 

You kept the fire burnin' 
You kept hope alive 
And when my soul was fallin' 
You helped me to survive 
And you led the way 
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith 

There's a dream that I dream, I never knew it would come true 
There's a place I never thought that I would be (Ooh) 
There is a chance (There's a chance) that I took
(That I took) that I never thought I'd take 
Until you came and helped me to believe, oh...oh... 

You were there when no one else was 
And you showed me a love unknown 

You kept the fire burnin' 
And you kept hope alive 
And when my soul was fallin' 
You helped me to survive 
And you led the way 
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith (Of faith, of 
faith, of faith, of faith, ooh) 

Leap of faith 
Oh, yeah 
Oh...oh...oh...oh... 

You showed me just how 
{How to believe in me} In me, oh... 
You moved that tree and tore that forest there for me 

You kept the fire burnin' (You kept it burnin') 
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive) 
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin') 
You helped me to survive (Yeah, you helped me to survive) 
You led the way 
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith, yeah 

You kept the fire burnin' (Woo) 
You kept hope alive (You kept the hope alive, yeah) 
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin') 
You helped me to survive (But you helped me to 
survive) 
You led the way 
Encouraging me to take 

The fire {Everybody}, hope {All my life} 
My soul {Someone's callin'} with you {I'll survive} 
You led {Go away}, encouraged me {To take} 
That leap of faith and make it over 
Now I owe my thanks to you, ho...oh... 

You kept the fire burnin' (Woo, hey) 
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive) 
When my soul was fallin' (When my soul was fallin') 
You helped me to survive (Ooh...you helped me to survive) 
Oh...yes, you did 
Pushing me to take that leap of faith 

You kept the fire burnin' 
You kept hope alive 
And when my soul was fallin' 
You helped me to survive 
Oh...oh...oh...oh...
