AKA Kellz I'm in the bulding 
Right now and im looking for nothin
But steppa Tell me where 
Tha steppas Where r all the steppas
Ooo Ooo Ooo I fell good i mean 
I dont mean to brag but um

Custom green suits apple gators
Hundred thousand on my wrist
Geeky shiny poopy climbing
White T Ella outfits
Jump out styling ladies smilin
Popa roxies everywhere
Hummer stretches limo lexis
Pull up while people stoppin stare
Like we're on t.v.

[Chorus:]
Sometimes life can be like a dream
When you're livin on a big screen
Fancy cars Movie stars
Red carpet and big applause
limoseumzs and search lights
This is how we gone do it tonight
So
Pause,Flash Pause,Flash 
Pause,Flash Pause,Flash
U and your partner r so so clean
So take a picture for tha memory
Pause,Flash Pause,Flash
Pause,Flash Pause,Falsh

Ooo I wanna go steppin now
Im bout to climb All I need is
My partner
We go together like a hand an glove
Ooo DJ put tha record on
Be sure its my favorite song
Step in the name of love
Step in the name of love
Yeah ooo ooo ooo like we're all
On t.v.

[Repeat Chorus]

You know us and how we like to 
Dress up and go out and hit
Tha club I'm not leavin here
Until I take me a picture
Cameraman just wait till I'm ready
On 3 ya'll 123 say cheese

[Repeat Chorus]
