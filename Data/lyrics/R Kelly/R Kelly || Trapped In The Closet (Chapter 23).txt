its taught you that
everybody's got a closet and
they' own problems that need solvin
Could this be another case
of what goes around
comes back around
and what goes up
must come--
Well yall've heard the saying
Yall get the point
Let me get back to the story
cause these next chapters of Trapped in the Closet
is gonna be so crazy.
Sylvester and Gwen chillin in the bed 
Watchin TV
No Drama
Phone rings he says "Hello" 
somebody says "Sylvester?"
he says "Who is this, and how did you get this number?"
Cathy and Rufus decides to do a little shoppin downtown
Only she can't, her phone rings again,
she says Rufus its those people again.
He says Hang up...Hang up!
Now everything seemed to calm down 
between Big Man, James, and Bridget
'till Bridget gets a call 
someone says "We wanna talk to you" 
she says "Who is this?"
