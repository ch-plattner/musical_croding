Smoke it up, smoke it up
Exhale, exhale
Now let's sex to the cut

[Chorus]
Girl, you got that sex weed
I just want to hit it all the time
Sex so good that it gets me high
Bring that home grown to me
Girl you got that fire weed
Light it up, let me take a puff
Of your sex weed

[Verse 1]

How did your sex make me feel this way
Like I've been smokin purple haze
Girl you got me blowed (gone)
Just one look at you I got contact
Can I get a pull of that
Girl your shit is the chronic
I can tell by the way you
Roll it up
Make a playa wanna smoke it up
Slow down for we choke it up
Sex give me the munchies
And I wanna eat it up oh
We can do a shotgun baby and
Take a sip of patrone baby
Now we off in a zone baby
Our boys gettin it on baby
Got be feelin hazy baby
Silly baby, horny baby, flyin baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Girl its like a dime bag dro (dro)
The way you movin that cush real slow
Got me floatin like a butterfly
Im so high, I can touch the sky
I'm a bud head when it comes to you
Cant nobody drop it baby

You got me buzzin off that chiefin baby
Girl you about to explode my brain
Doin it in the coupe
While we on them thangs
Sex weed about to drive me insane
Baby hands down you got that bomb shit (shit)

Cause your sex weed aint no joke
So girl go ahead and light that dope
