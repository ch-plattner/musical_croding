In your dreams take you to my ecstacy
All alone in my room just you and me
When we awake it will be a reality
Girl I'll have your body singin oooh la la
Once I turn it over and hit it real hard
Boo my only mission is to make you see stars
Put me up to bat and I'm a knock it out the park
Shake ya ass riba riba like your Mexican
