
Finally the weekend's come 
And everything is goin' down
Nine to five and now it's time 
For me to get around
Good poppin' ain't no stoppin' everybody's in the mood
Mind blowin' once you feel the music startin' to get to you
Disco nights, party lights, it's all good for me

[1] - Thank God it's Friday
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right
It's a party
Thank God it's Friday
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right
It's a party

Throw your hands up 
If you're ready to get down and jam tonight
Music's got ya jumpin' 
And you're feeling not a care tonight
Keep goin' don't you stop
Just let this volume get in you
Take some time out for yourself 
And let this Friday get to you
Disco nights, party lights
It's all good for me

[Repeat 1]

Oh God, thank you for Friday
Oh thank you heavenly Father
Oooo so many people lookin', lookin' for the spot
There's a party over here
So many people lookin' for the party spot
If you find it
Let me know and I'll be there until I drop
Valet parking at the club
It lets you know it's Friday night
People swayin', music playin' 
And this weekend feels so right, yeah

[Repeat 1]

My sistas, enjoy your weekend 
And may God bless all of you
