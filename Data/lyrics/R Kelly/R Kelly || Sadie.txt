
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to 
Eat
She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school
Filled with the long of glory 
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things 

This troubled world can bring.

[CHORUS]

Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie

Place No one above you sweet Sadie

Well Well Well

Living in the past

Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old Brandy
Always that needed 
Smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so 
Happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the 
Binds with just a simple song

[CHORUS]

Oh Sadie
She's Loving my song in a special way
Sweet Sadie
Living in the 
Past
Oh she's never sinning in Love she's always winnin
My my my my my
I 
Love you mama
I just can't forget how you gave me love oh no
If there's a 
Heaven up above I know she's teaching angels how to love
Its a mean world 
Without ya
And I surely miss you much mother
And now that your gone I'm 
Gonna carry on
Cause your cryin lady
Ooh sadie
When I think about the 
Things that you done for me
Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me

Oh oh oh oo oh
See I love you mama
Yes I do
I'll never forget you mama no 
Oh oh oh
