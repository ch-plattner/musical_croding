[Chorus ]
There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
[2X ]

[Verse 1]
I wanna make you moann 
Do it all night long 
Once I get you home 
Baby girl it's on 
I'm gonna kiss yo lips 
Then I'm gonna raise yo slip 
I'm gonna take your hand 
And let you feel these ribs 
I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?- 
I'm a winner in bed 
Go to dinner?-, go to dinner?-, go to dinner?- 
Go to dinner in bed 
Listen babe, 

[Chorus]
There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
[2X]

[Verse 2]
I wanna show you love 
From the bottom up 
Once the light goes off 
You can't get enough 
I wanna be yo man 
Not a one night stand 
And if you take my hand 
I bet 1 hundred grand 
I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?-, I'm a winner?- 
I'm a winner in bed, yes I am 
Go to dinner?-, go to dinner?-, go to dinner?- 
And the dinner in bed, there can only be?- 

[Chorus]
There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
[2X]

[Verse 3]
Girl open your dictionary look under love 
And your gonna see my face 
Come to bed right now lets cover up 
Nothin' but sweat comin' between us in this place 

[Chorus]
There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me) 
[2X]

[Verse 4]
Do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be, do ya wanna be?- 
Wanna be with me tonight 
Do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see, do ya wanna see?- 
How I'm gonna do yo body right 
Do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go, do ya wanna go?- 
Go on a 12 play ride 
You'll be goin' all out 
Like a prom night 
And you won't make it home 
Cuz you realize 

[Chorus]
There can only be one me (can't nobody can't nobody do your body like me)
