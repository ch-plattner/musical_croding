
Hey yo, R. 
Let me handle my business
I just wanna take over the show for a minute
Not the whole show, just a little bit

Now that he's outta the way 
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can I break it down and break you off 
Some of this computer lovin' type of shit
Lookin' at you from the inside of this internet
I'm in the mood, and my tongue is in the mood
Ladies, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?
Said, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?

I got something for y'all 
Can I give it to you?

Now listen, 2nd kelly what you got for me, y'all say
I got some down low, down low, sing it for me
Now 2nd kelly, what you got for me, y'all say
I got some 12 play, 12 play, sing it
Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, sing
I got some bump and grind, bump and grind, sing it y'all
Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, say
Do you mind if I stroke you up
Do you mind if I stroke you down

Ladies, ladies, tell me do you want more?
I said do you want more?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na sing

Now y'all having fun?
Too bad it's time for me to get up out of here
But before I do
I wanna blow the roof off this place with this last one
Are y'all ready?
All right, now everybody let me hear you say
Ooh na na na na na na
Ooh na na na na na na
Yeah, now, that was loud, right? 
But I think y'all can get a little louder
If y'all what Kelly to come back out here
With what he about to get dressed in
Y'll do it louder come on here we go, come on
Ooh na na na na an na what
Ooh na na na na na na 

I know y'all must be trippin' on me
Damn
