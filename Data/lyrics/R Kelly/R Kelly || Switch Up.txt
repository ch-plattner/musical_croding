
I'm about to switch it up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up

If she ain't fuckin', I'ma switch up
Hit her friend's cell like, "What up?"
I don't ever change, real nigga
I be there when her man slip up
I'll disappear in that 'Lago
Then reappear in that Ghost
I hit it hard from the back
And then I let Uber get her home
Same shit, new day
New bitch, new brain
Got my cell twerkin'
But I forget their names
Got a million dollars in the club
So it ain't shit to throw it up
But real talk, I'ma switch it quick
If them bitches ain't tryna fuck

We been here before
Same shit, new day
Same drama anyway
Baby ain't shit changed
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Call now, now then pick up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
You done got way too comfy
Girl you ain't the only one that want me
Hit you with the switch up
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Baby watch me switch up

[Jeremih:]
Don't make a nigga hit you with the switch up
You know what I'm on when I hit you
Been a real nigga, I don't switch up
Dick up in her, make her get the hiccups
When her man call, she don't pick up
I ain't even worried 'bout it
Baby let's try a new position
Elbows to her knees like a sit-up
New ocean, new wave
New bitch, new day
New Ghost, new Wraith
Lights down, no way
I'ma have to hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up
I'ma have to hit you with the switch up
Might just send a Uber, pick a bitch up

[R. Kelly + Jeremih:]
We been here before
Same shit, new day
Same drama anyway
Baby ain't shit changed
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Guess I, guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Call now, now then pick up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
You done got way too comfy, baby
Girl you ain't the only one that want me
Hit you with the switch up
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Baby watch me switch up

[Lil Wayne:]
Pull up in the car with the lid up
Pull up with a broad and she did up
Pull her out the car if she spit up
Take her ass home, eat her clit up
Body like a pinup, I hit it with my chin up
Tell her call a friend up, and if she acts stuck up
There's plenty fish in the sea with their fin up
Then I gotta hit her with the switch up
I got another bitch comin', gotta clean up
But if pinched up is how a nigga end up
You know I make sure I hit her with the prenup
I got styrofoam cups, she got D-cups
She call me every day tryna re-up
I just cut on R. Kelly and I put it in her belly
And I gotta switch up, no re-runs, Tunechi

We been here before
Same shit, new day
Same drama anyway
Baby ain't shit changed
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Guess I, guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Call now, now then pick up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
You done got way too comfy, baby
Girl you ain't the only one that want me
Hit you with the switch up
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Baby watch me switch up
