
What's up baby
I know what you're thinking
What did I call you over here for 
I wanna take you somewhere

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go

Step into my territory 
And let the vibes begin
Don't be afraid
Just let this love groove in
Let the passion lead you to a place beyond
Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun

[Chorus]

All the players go
All the gangstas go

[Chorus]

Rules they are so simple, so very simple
As our bodies connect 
And those juices start to flow
Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light
And satisfying love's appetite

[Chorus (2x's)]

Baby tell Daddy what it is you want
Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown
Time to taste what love has in store for me
So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry

[Chorus (3x's)]
