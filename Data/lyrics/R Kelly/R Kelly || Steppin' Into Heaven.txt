
It's the Piper y'all
I just wanna know what y'all are doin' this weekend
Ha, ha
I got somethin' goin' down
And I just want y'all to be there
To share this dream of love

You're invited
To come and be a part of a
Celebration
On my love train
You don't need nothin'
Come as you are, just
Make sure when I show you love
You show love back the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Uhh, got my shoes, got my hat, got my suit
And I'm ready to go now
Oh yeah
And me and my partner look so good
It's like we about to do a show now
So if you're steppin' come on down

[Chorus]
Grab your partner
Hit the dance floor
Tonight we'll be
Steppin' into Heaven
Steppin' into Heaven
Grab her hand and
Spin her 'round and 'round
Tonight we'll be
Steppin' into Heaven

Oh, congratulations
If you're celebratin'
Your anniversary
Or your birthday
Here by yourself?
Then get up and find some one
Because
We don't need no reason to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Music is like
Music is like a holiday
It makes me wanna celebrate
It makes me call somebody up
And tell'em let's go hit the floor

Every time
Every time I
I hear the music
Wow
Makes me wanna
Makes me wanna
Tell somebody

[Chorus]
