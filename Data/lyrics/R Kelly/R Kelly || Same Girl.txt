[R. Kelly]
Yo Ush..
[Usher]
What up Kells
[R. Kelly]
Wanna introduce you to this girl. Think I really love this girl.
[Usher]
Yeah...
[R. Kelly]
Man she's so fine.
[Usher]
Straight up dog...
[R. Kelly]
She stands about 5'4", Coca Cola, red bone
[Usher]
Damn...
[R. Kelly]
She drives a black Durango
License plate say Angel
Tattoo on her ankle
Plus she's making pesos.
Gotta crib on Peachtree,
Right on 17th street
And I call her Te Te.
[Usher]
Wait a minute hold on dog. Do she got a kid? [Yep]
She loves some waffle house? [Yep]
Do she got a beauty mark on the left side of her mouth? [Man]
Went to Georgia Tech? [Yep]
Works for TBS? [Yep]
Man I can't believe this shit. Damn!
[R. Kelly]
Tell me what's wrong dog what the hell you damnin' 'bout?
I'm your homie so just say what's on your mind.
[Usher]
Man I didn't know that you were talkin' 'bout her.
[R. Kelly]
So man you telling me you know her?
[Usher]
Do I know her? Like a pastor know his word.

[Chorus]
We messing with the same girl, the same girl.
[R. Kelly]
How could the love of my life and my potential wife be the same girl?
[Usher]
Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the same girl, the same girl.
[R. Kelly]
Thought she's someone I could trust
But she's been doubling up with us.
U, K, man we been messing with same girl.

[Usher]
See I met her at this party in ATLANTA!
[R. Kelly]
Well I met her at this party in CHICAGO!
[Usher]
She came right up to me giving me conversation.
I said, "Do you gotta a man?"
She said, "No," with no hesitation.
[R. Kelly]
Well, it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me.
At party all in my face while I'm laughing and buying her drinks
[Usher]
She whispered in my ear and said, "Can you take me home?"
[R. Kelly]
ME TOO! Man she was in the shower singing that same song
[Usher]
Is that true?
[R. Kelly]
And I thought it was true confessions when she said, "I love you."
[Usher]
Man I thought her body was calling when she said, "I want you."
Look I even got some pictures on my phone.
[R. Kelly]
Look at there. There she is with some boy shirts on.

[Chorus]
She's the apple of my eye and my potential wife.
Man I just can't believe that we've been messing around with the same damn girl.
Thought she was someone I could trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us.
U, K man we been messing with the same girl.

[Usher]
Said she got me on a ring tone
[R. Kelly]
Are you talking about the pink phone?
[Usher]
Uh uh the blue one
[R. Kelly]
Man she told me that was turned off.
[Usher]
It's obvious that she's been playing us, playing us.
[R. Kelly]
'Cause constantly she's been lying to us, lying to us.
[Usher]
Don't like the way that she's been going 'bout it, going 'bout it.
Kells what you think that we should do about it, do about it?
[R. Kelly]
Call her up at her home.
She won't know that I'm on the phone.
[Usher]
Yeah man that's the way.
[R. Kelly]
Homie we about to bust this trick.
Man just tell her to meet up with you
And I'm going to show up too
[Usher]
And she won't know what to do.
[R. Kelly]
We'll be standing there singing.

[Chorus 'til fade]
