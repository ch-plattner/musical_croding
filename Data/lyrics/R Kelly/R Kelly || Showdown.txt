[Verse 1 (R. Kelly)]
I feel that the time is here
for you to bring your body here
And give me what I've waited for
Hurry up and come on in and close the door
I'm about to get up on it
Feed me girl cause I'm so hungry
Got plenty money but I'm still lonely
Gotta have you now cause me so---
Black and Asia girl, 
Tattoo on your tummy
Thugged out and scared
But I'm uh make you love me
Say some aphrodisiacs
Baby girl its on
I promise you I will do all these words to the song

[Chorus]
Showdown

(Rodeo be like) up and down
(Bout to show you how I) roll down

Showdown

[Verse 2 (R. Kelly)]
I'll be making you my lady
S.E.- got me going crazy
Any-thing that you want me to do
I'll do anything cause I'm feeling you
All through the club girl you dance so freaky
Tall diamond pierced with a look that kinky
Ac-ting like you want me to turn you---
Attitude like what, Kelly turn me now
Black and Asia girl,
Tattoo on your tongue
Thugged out and scared
But I'm uh make you love me
Say some aphrodisiacs
Baby girl its on
I promise you I will do all these words to the song

[Verse 3 (R. Kelly)]
Now gimme the mic so i can get buck wild
Like fiesta, fiesta still moving the crowd
Out of all the girls I've loved before
Got plenty of honeys--
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door
Its my house for me to live not yours
If I wanted to I could- on the floors
Through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk
Penny and Chris you know that boys tow up
About 8 or 9 black stallion riding up
Its Mr. Big screaming showdown I'm like what...

[Mr. Big]
Now Kelly-
Its not enough room in this town
For you and me so lets get down
I'm sick and tired of you and this down low fight
From contagious all the way to Mrs. Price
You done it now with Ms. Black Asia
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging
House, cars, shopping mall
Man I tell you its a battle call
Like a raging bull
I'm about to charge
Kelly, you won't see tomorrow
Its time to put a end to your late night creeps
Now any last words before my pistol speaks...

[(R. Kelly) -spits-]
Mr. Biggs-
Now no disrespect but man I'm tired
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding
We've been in and out of fights on these videos
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo
See I dated lila '98 of September
You took her from me yea right you don't remember
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
How clever you were when you slipped her your number
(ooh) I know that makes ya'll wanna know
(ooh) Who's really on the down low
You wonder why we're always at it there it is
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs
Cause I'm about to get- wild, wild, west
Sick and tired of your mess
You put me to the test 
And now I'm sticking out my chest
So any last words before I draw these cannons
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing

[chorus x2]
