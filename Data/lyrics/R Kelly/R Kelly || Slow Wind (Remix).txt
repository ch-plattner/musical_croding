[Verse 3: Akon]
With all that meat hangin girl I feel like a butcher
Just wanna chop you up and cut ya
Got the whole place schemin like a hustler
With that beautiful skin the color of Muster
I can't help but to bother you, lookin like my white BMW
Love you sittin on my rim, matter fact 'gon hop in
Now jump in the backseat and chill
Got some for you girl you can feel
Lay your body down in the six forty five
Let the soft leather caress ya while I drill
I know you like it, I know you like it
Just ran into Divine with a shorty so fine lookin so excited
Now she thinks we all cassonovas, that's when
I put the legs on my shoulder
And just ride her like a Range Rover
Like a dollar bill I had to unfold her, ummm hmmm
R. Kells cop three in the shack, Sean Paul
hit the back and never came back
You know we beat till the early mornin
Daylight come and now we want a little more of that

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
(Whoa!) Come on baby would you wine for me
(Whoa!) Girl I wanna see you wine for me
(Whoa!) In the club would you wine for me
(Remix!) All I wanna do is see you wine for me
(Whoa!) Come on baby would you wine for me
(Whoa!) Girl I wanna see you wine for me
(Whoa!) In the club would you wine for me
(Remix!) All I wanna do is see you wine for me

[Outro: R. Kelly]
It's your boyfriend (Wine for me)
All the ladies in the club let me see you wine (Wine for me)
