
Baby you are the song of my life
And the sweetest melody
And I love making love to your eyes
It's like singing in the perfect key

You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit

I got a studio up in heaven
And it's the perfect atmosphere
It's guaranteed to make you platinum
All you gotta do is come here

Let me make you my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit

The way you put your music on me
Symphony should be your name
It's like God gave me the perfect echo
When he sent your love my way

You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit

New York to LA and 
France onto Rome 
LA hit Vegas then dance our way home 
Our music plays all around the world 
And my life has been a smash since you became my.... 

You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit

We went way past gold 

You are my Elvis and Priscilla 
My Michael Jackson Thriller 
Smooth Operator by Sade 
Baby let's not forget the 12 Play 
You're my Titanic boat 
My moon and star 
My Coming to America my Avatar
