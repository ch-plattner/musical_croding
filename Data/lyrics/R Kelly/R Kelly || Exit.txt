Swear I want more
You deserve an encore
Back stage VIP shopping 
Now it's raining
Won't you come and tell me how you with it
What you want girl you can get it
These clubbers won't treat you like I treat you
Big chips, black cards you'll be my pool star
Somebody say you looking for me, girl here I go

Oh look at oh my god
Who do we have
Up in the club dancing for me?
Girl let me help you chase your dreams
You're so beautiful......

(How can I make you understand)
Ooo that I want to rub, I want to touch, every little inch of your body
(Body)
Girl if you go with me
You're incredible......girl
(Oh yes you are)

Baby see the exit, exit, see the exit, let's go, out this club
Exit, exit, exit, see the exit, let's go out this club, exit

Now baby girl if that's your man forget about it go on and dance
And I really didn't mean no harm 
It's just a player's charm
Any girl and I do it rather well, 
Closing every bar like a professor baby
Kells gives sex seminars 
When you walk by so slow make me whistle
(You've got pretty teeth) 
And I feel so good when you smile at me yea
I'm about to write you everything 
Baby girl please just go with me
I've got a big house in the mountains lets go 
And I've even got a stripper pole
Excuse me miss somebody says you're looking for me, girl here I go...

Oh look oh my gosh who do we have up in the club dancing for me
Why you upstaging these chicks? 
Girl you've got the dance... order
How can I make you understand?
Ooo that I want to rub I want to touch every little inch of your body (body)
Girl you need to go with me
It's the last call... for alcohol girl
(yes it is)

Girl can you see the exit, exit, see the exit, lets go out this club
Exit, exit, exit see the exit lets go out this club, exit

When you see me, 
Tour bus your block, 
Back of maybach
Black shades on down low in your hood
Smoking on that good

Go take a picture, autograph, crack some jokes, make me laugh
Take some shots baby now
Come to my hotel
Girl I love the way youre teasing me, you and your girlfriend on the dance floor
I'm thinkin menagitwa
So wantchu jump up off of my car
Girl it's so pretty, leather interior, custom made for me,
Let the top of that go back, then pull up the the club real slow
So the fans can take a flick,
Girl I get a kick out of splurging on you
Nordstrom, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Vicki Secret too
Baby skies the limit where we go from here
Once were in the Benz, now take me serious when I say
I'm gonna walk out of here with you

When you see the exit, exit, see the exit, lets go out this club
Exit, exit, exit see the exit lets go out this club
Exit (exit)
