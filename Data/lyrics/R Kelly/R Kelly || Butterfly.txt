And it will never rain as long I'm around youuuu
My struggles don't exist since I met youuu youuu
Don't have to search no more since my eyes found

Seeds and watching them grow with you

Unreal to good to be true how I feel when I'm inside
Of you something like a miracle but All so spritual
Staring in your eyes while your juices flow

You're so beautiful Ohh you make my life so

Girl you spread your wings just like a butterfly
And then you take flight just like a butterfly
Bouncing through the wind just like a butterfly
