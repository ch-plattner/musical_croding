
Aye-aye, aye-aye 
Aye-aye, aye, uh 

Stupid, look at you now 
You screwed it all up 
You kept gamblin' 
And ran out of luck 
You thought you was strong 
Thought you was so tough 
And now all you've got 
Is your pride to hold 
And that's not enough 

Uh, never seen this kind of rain 
This change is so strange 
Though I feel your absence 
It's like a numb pain 
Girl, I want to feel again 

I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 
I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 
I don't want to be, no 

SOS, SOS 
Call SOS, SOS 
Callin' SOS, SOS 
Call SOS, SOS 

She gave you the world 
And you threw it away 
Plus she was your girl 
And you're engaged 
Inseparable through holiday 
Now she's invisible 
Gone away 

I've been hit by a truck 
And I'm bleeding inside 
The cure is too far away 
And I'm about to die 

Never seen this kind of rain 
Ooh, this change is so strange 
Though I feel your absence 
It's like a numb pain, yeah 
Girl, I want to feel again 

I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 
I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes, no 
I don't want to be, no 

By the time the sun rise again, (rise again) 
I'm hoping you will be with me, cause 
I don't want to go on without you 
And I don't want to live here without you 

I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 
I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 

I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes 
I don't want to be here 
Doin' dishes, dishes 
Doin' dishes
