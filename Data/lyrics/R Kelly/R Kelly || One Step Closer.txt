One Step Closer... To You
One Step Closer... To You

Well, it’s a quarter to that time Baby
And you’re the only thing on my mind Baby
And I’m ‘bout to punch outta’ here, girl I promise, 
and I’m comin’ straight home to you my dear. (Woh-Oh)
So just make sure you’ve got that nothin’ on,
and you’re waiting for me Baby (you)
To walk thru the door, and give it to ya’ Baby
Every way possible, just how you like it Babe.
And I’m so thankful for my shinin’ star,
So glad I don’t have to wonder where your are.
Now, I’m about to get on the elevator baby goin’ down,
I’m coming home, home, home.

One Step Closer... To You
(And it won’t be long, Baby I’m getting)
One Step Closer... To You
(Said I’m On My Way)
(Said I’m On My Way)

I’m, starting the car right now, while
My imagination is going wild right now Babe
I’m thinkin’ bout what I’m gon’ do
When I get to you, Ooh,Ooh-Ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Time must be on our side, ‘cause
Baby so far every light is a green light yeah.
And soon, I’ll be there, so girl beware, 
I’m gonna’ kiss you up and down, in between,
Having your body screaming yeah (oh, oh)

Oh I’m so thankful for my little shining star
And girl, I’m so glad I don’t have to wonder where you are!
Baby, see you don’t have to worry no more,
Cause soon, I’ll be coming thru the door.

One Step Closer... (ooh baby, just one step closer)
To You... (to you, Babe, and it won’t be long, baby I’m getting)
One Step Closer... (one step closer baby) 
To You (to ya’ girl), (said I’m on my way), (said I’m on my way).

I’m turnin’ the corner, ‘bout to pull up in the driveway.
Now, I’m hoppin’ up out the car, and I’m walking to the door.
Goin’ up the steps, keys in my hand, unlock the door,
Turn the knob, baby now I’m in the house.
Up the stairs in the room, DAMN!!!  

YOU... BABE,
Said you look so good to me laying there, with nothing on 
And it makes me wanna’!!!
Kiss every inch of your body 
So don’t you go nowhere, just stay right there, 
I’m gonna’ move a little closer...
Step, step, step, step, step
Ooh I’m at your feet baby
Tell me girl, do you like what I’m doin’
Well, can I Move On Up???
(step, step, step, step, step)
Now... I’m at your knees can see you you’re shakin’
See you can’t take it, girl I’m ‘bout to do it Get Ready-Get Ready

Get Closer...
(steppin’ closer to ya’ baby!!!)
To You...
(said I’m goin’ down, and I’m not comin’ back up baby, baby yeah)
One Step Closer...
(one step-closer-to you-hey) - (one step closer to you...)
To You...
(goin’ down, goin’ down, goin’ down) 
(goin’ down, goin’ down, goin’ down)
