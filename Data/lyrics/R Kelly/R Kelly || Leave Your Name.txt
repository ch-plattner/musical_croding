[Verse 1]
You have reached R.Kelly
Unfortunately, I'm sleep
Been out partying all night
And I'm blasted off that Hennessey
I hop to hotel lobbies
Going to them after parties
Throwing up and carrying on
Bout to have somebody drive me home
I get through the door
Fall on the floor
Get up
I'm staggering
Look upstairs
Shit is blurry because I'm real bent
And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going
And this goes out to all of my honeys that's calling

[Chorus 1]
Leave your name right after the beep and I'm
Sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or
Smoking on some trees or
Having a little sex or
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby

(Would you please, yeah)
Leave your name right after the beep and I'm
Sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or (Said if)
Blowing on trees (I'm not)
Having some sex (That's all, yeah)
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby

[Verse 2]
Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin
I told myself never again
Sleeping while the club is crunk
Don't make no sense to be that drunk
Arguing through the night
Pushing on people and starting fights
I was fucked up
I confess
People saying Kellz is a hot mess
Even after that I was taking shots
Shot after shot
Shot after shot then
I couldn't even open the door to my Benz
Dropped off and I get in the door now
Lying on the stairs snoring now
Why you calling me calling me calling me?
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up Kellz
Why you calling me calling me calling me?
Pick it up 

Pick it up
Pick it up
But I'm knocked out sleep

[Chorus 2]
So leave your name (please leave your name) right after the beep (right after) and I'm
Sure to get back with you (Yeah)
If I'm not asleep (No)
Smoking on some trees or (Smoking on trees, yeah)
Having a little sex or (In the middle of having sex)
If I'm not faded or (Yeah)
Making a baby (Won't you please leave your name)

Leave your name right after the beep and I'm (Oh yeah)
Sure to get back with you (Right back)
If I'm not asleep or (I'll call you back) 
Blowing on trees (Oh yes, I'll call you back)
Having some sex (I'll call you back)
If I'm not faded or (I'll call you back)
Making a baby

[Bridge]
When the morning comes and I'm sober
And everything is cool
I'll check my message
And I promise to get right back with you
And if you think I'm screening calls
You're mothafuckin right
That's for the haters
I return calls to all the girls I like

[Chorus 3]
So leave your name (leave your name) right after the beep (leave your name, yeah) and I'm
Sure to get back with you (I'm sure to get back witcha)
If I'm not asleep (If I'm not asleep)
Smoking on some trees or (Trees)
Having a little sex or (Sex or yeah yeah)
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby (Just leave your name yeah yeah)

Leave your name right after (right after, right after) the beep and I'm 
Sure to get back with you 
If I'm not asleep or (If I'm not asleep) (I'll call you back) 
Blowing on trees (Oh yes, I'll call you back)
Having some sex (Some sex yeah) (I'll call you back)
If I'm not faded or (I'll call you back)
Making a baby 

So leave your name right after the beep and I'm
Sure to get back with you (Sure to get back with you)

Damn, 200 missed calls
