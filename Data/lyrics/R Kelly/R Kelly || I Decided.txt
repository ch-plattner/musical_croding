[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonite
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I make for love

[Verse 1]
Enough is enough no more running around
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always
(Tired of this ego trip)
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man
And I just can't have that happen to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Now I've had about all that I can stand no more
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)
It was silly of me to be the way that I was
(First was blind, but now I see)
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here
For always
Forever more, I decided

[Chorus & Bridge 2]

Girl I'm going to dump my friends
Yes I will
Truly I will
We are going to be together on the weekend
Whoa, whoa
See these are the decisions I made for love
For the two of us
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust
Yeah, yeah, oh noooooo, whoa
There will be
No more cheatin'
No more creepin'
No more fuckin'
No more sneakin'
