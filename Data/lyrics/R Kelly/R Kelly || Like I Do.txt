Oh, oh oh, oh oh [x2]

I ain't a doctor
Can't save a life
To say I could, I'd be outta my mind
I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles
That's another thing I won't even try

See there's a lot of things I can't do
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories, I do
I blow the competition out of the water

[Chorus]
There's only 2 things, in this world
That I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music, baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out,

Like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

I ain't a painter, ain't got a brush
To paint a portrait of love
I ain't no pilot
Can't take you up
So you can fly through the heavens above

See there's a lot of things I can't do
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories, I do
I blow the competition out of the water

[Chorus]
There's only 2 things, in this world
That I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music, baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out,

Like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer
Come to my health club and baby let me train ya
Bend it over, stretch (ooh)
Stretch (ooh), stretch (ooh)
Baby let me you train ya

I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer
Come to my health club and baby let me train ya
Bend it over, stretch (ooh)
Stretch (ooh), stretch (ooh)
Baby let me you train ya

[Chorus]
There's only 2 things, in this world
That I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music, baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out,

Like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

Oh, gonna make your body say
Oh, oh oh, oh oh (come on baby)
Baby (baby), woah baby
Ooo, ooo, ooo,
Forget about it baby, listen shawty
Can't nobody rock your body, like the R.
