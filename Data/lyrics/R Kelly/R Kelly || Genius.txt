
Body’s so freakin’ soft, 
I can’t wait to turn it on. 
You got me like la la la la la baby, 
is how you make me feel baby. 
I can feel your body flowers, 
while I’m kissing on your thighs. 
You got me like la la la la baby. 
Anticipations so crazy.

I’ll be good to you, promise. 
While making love to you, promise! 
Go to sleep, and when we wake up, 
I’ma hit that thing again, promise! 
Signs and miracles up in this room, 
while I’m pleasing you.

[Chorus:]
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body, 
girl tonight you’re lying with a sex genius. 
Nothing like the ordinary, I’m a love wonder, 
tonight you’re lying with a sex genius.

Baby girl, we’re both so freakin’ hot, 
we don’t wanna freakin’ stop! 
Got each other like la la la la la baby. 
Oh, tell me I’m the master baby. 
Now I got you out them clothes. 
Your body’s so beautiful. 
The mirror says la la la la la baby. 
This moment’s like heaven baby. 

And I’ll be good to you, promise. 
While making love to you, promise. 
Go to sleep and when we wake up, 
I’ma hit that thing again, promise! 
Signs and miracles up in this room, 
while I’m pleasing you.

[Chorus x2]

I know you heard it all before. 
From I got that thing now. 
I got that thing now. 
Don’t you believe ’em cause all of them are wanna be’s. 
Tonight I’m bout to prove myself. 
You won’t ever have to ask no more. 
I’m a college grad. Girl I got my degree. 
I’m the head of my class. 
Girl, you meant the real thing. 
Signs and miracles up in this room, 
girl I’m pleasing youuuuuuuuuu!

[Chorus x3]
