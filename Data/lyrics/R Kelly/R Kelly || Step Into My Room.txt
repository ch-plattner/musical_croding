Yo, what's up baby?
I don't see no sign on my door that says it's closed

[Chorus]
Step in my room
'Cause I got a little something for you baby
In my room
And I know you're gonna like it baby
Step in my room
'Cause I got a little something for you baby
In my room

Finally we're all alone
So lock the doors and unplug the phone
I wanna take you where passion lies
Girl you want my lovin', I can see it in your eyes
Baby don't hold back the feelin'
Just bring your body to me
And I'm gonna give you everything you need

[Chorus]

Makin' sweet love 'til morning comes
Still lovin' you after it's said and done
And doin' those things you want me to do to you baby
Like goin' down on you by the fireplace
Baby don't hold back the feelin'
Just bring that body to me
And I'm gonna give you everything you need

[Chorus]

Hey there lady, you drive me crazy
Sexy lady, you drive me crazy

[Chorus]
