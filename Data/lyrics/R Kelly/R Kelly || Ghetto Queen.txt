Crucial Conflict come out and play, hey come on
Crucial Conflict, Kelly and Rockland, collabo'

Funny faces is all I see
At my place, you on top of me
Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'
I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets
I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty
Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this
My ghetto queen

[1] - You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

Might be ghetto but you queen to me 
That's how it's suppose to be
Do whatcha gotta do for me 
Forever fulfill your fantasy
When you think of me, have your cream
Everything my team must to do one thing
You're the meanest queen on the scene
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams
For real, it's real as it seems
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's

Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland
I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10
Want some ends? You outta there
No more funny face, put you in your place
Come be the dinner, I'm a bring a plate

She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen
Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring
Personality rings bells in my dreams
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'
Cuz she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'
Right around the way from me
This ghetto queen got up with a king
Keep it clean and in essence

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

[Kilo]
Where the players live
Have to deal with the Macks 
Like the traps in the concrete jungle
Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin'
In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos
We be like this, gettin' high
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby 
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it
Don't fall off, hold on
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty
You're makin' me wantin' to snap
I know your man is mad as hell
Cuz it to a player and I did it well
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know
Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm

[Wyldstyle]
Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans,
That think they're mean
I'll massage you with whip cream
I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady
Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me
Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off
Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick 'em low)
Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang
Me and you, everyday keep it high like flames (your game)
What's my name? What's my name?
It's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame
Me and the ghetto queen comin' up the main
Switchin' four lanes, to the airplane
Sky high we fly when we roll by
On the down low, doin' my thang man

[Repeat 1]

Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo'
Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo'

[Repeat 1 until fade]
