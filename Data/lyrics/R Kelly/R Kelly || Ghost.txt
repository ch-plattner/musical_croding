You use to be so many colors to me
Now when I look at you all I see is clear. 
and nothing else in this world matters to me
just as long as I have you near.
I step right off the highest mountain
thinking I could walk the sky 
tell me and I would believe.
but this would be the last time you made me cry.
cause I can see you nothing but a smoke screen.

[chorus]
A ghost, your nothing but a ghost to me.
A ghost and you don't exist no more
Nothing but a ghost to me
A ghost and you don't exist no more.
See you use to be my dream now,
all you do is told me go, go, go
aye aye aye aye

I use to think Heaven when I look at you
because you were an angel to me
but now all this hell that you took me through 
maybe you lost your wings
i use to feel like I was on top of the world 
with you I would go anywhere 
but then I woke up at the bottom of the surf, 
and saw you both laying there.

[chorus]
A ghost, your nothing but a ghost to me.
A ghost and you don't exist no more
Nothing but a ghost to me
A ghost and you don't exist no more.
See you use to be my dream now,
all you do is told me go, go, go
aye, aye, aye, aye

You use to love me and now slowly
I see you drifting 
ever since you broke my heart in two 
I don't want to have nothing to do with you.
even though I still wont go nowhere 
I got to walk away from this all. 
I hold my strengh, 
Yes I can do this
Scratch your name off my list

[chorus]
A ghost, your nothing but a ghost to me.
A ghost and you don't exist no more
Nothing but a ghost to me
A ghost and you don't exist no more.
See you use to be my dream now,
all you do is told me go, go, go
aye aye aye aye [2x]
