
Rockland
In my life
Uhh, Track Masters
You're all I need in my life
Make money
You're all I need in my life
Duece, duece
You're all I need in my life

[R]
Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember in the days 
Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real
But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal
We used to use the streets for the football field
In church free lunch was our only meal
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels
Living it up in Beverly Hills

[Tone]
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary
Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry
All you player haters going down like Mary
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, Track Masters top billers

[1] - Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
So happy (Show me the loot)

I never thought that I 
Could make someone like you
I felt energized 
When you went through my groove
I'll never let you go no
You're so right for me
I've got to let you know
Forever you and me
(The balla's anthem right here)

[Repeat 1]

You must be heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you honey the money
We have a love that's long 
And true I make you in many ways
I've got to roll with you
In each and every day

[Repeat 1]

You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
I said you're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one
I don't need no one but you

[Repeat 1]

You're all I need in my life
I said you're all I need in my life
