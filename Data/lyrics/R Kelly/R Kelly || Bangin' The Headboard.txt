
Feel so freaky
I feel so freaky
Listen

There's something about the way you look at me
And it's got me imaginin' and seein' things
Like us both in a room
At my domain
About to blow up and
And hit like a hurricane
And I can't take it no more
And you can't fake it no more
Playin' hard to get girl
Please leave that thought outside the door
Cuz the truth of the matter is that you want me and I want you up
So let's quit playin around and get our ass up under this cover
(ooo)
There's so many things I want to do to you
(ooo)
There's so many things I want for you
(ooo)
On this night I'll make sure you won't regret it
What you and me did in this bed

Girl we'll be bangin,' bangin, bangin', bbbangin',
the headboard
Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',
the headboard
Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',
the headboard
Banging', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',
the headboard

and ooo (ooo) it feels just like we're floatin' in this pool
And the water bought this fire out of you
And there ain't no other girl on this earth I choose
Baby but you
And I'm going to rock that body fast to sleep
(Girl once you have had enough)
And you goin' to give that body back to me
(As soon as you wake up)
Startin' back all over again
second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth wind
til the mornin' comes
I'm goin' to be in (yeah)

(ooo)
There's so many things I want to do to you
(ooo)
And there's so many things I want for you
(ooo)
On this night I'll make sure you won't regret
What me and you did in this bed

(Did, oooooooo)
Girl we'll be bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin'
the headboard
(Bangin the headboard)
Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',

Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',

Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin',

Baby hold the pillow tight it's bout to be a wild night
Squeak in the bed
And we'll going to make the walls bang
Squeak in the bed
And baby-girl I hope that you can hang
Ooh Ooh
And those are the sounds that were makin'
when were bangin', bangin', bangin', (Yeah)

We'll be bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin'
