She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

She took me back
After I broke my heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted, I'm forever indebted to her cause

When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I like to tell ha, I like to tell ha, that I’m forever indebted, that I’m forever indebted, forever indebted to her cause

When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
Yea, yea

See a woman love
It would never die young
Even when I’m dead and gone, I’m gonna love her from the sky, yea
Cause she’s given me
Something that no other woman has given me (Whooooo)
When I think about you girl it makes me think

When, when, when, when a woman
When a
Woman
Loves
She loves for real (oh)
When a woman loves, loves, loves
I’m tellin you when she loves
She, she loves for real
Yea, yea, yea
When she loves (When she loves) [6x]
She (When she loves) [3x]
She loves for real
