
Sunny days, I promised you
Life's window pain
With a perfect view
A vow to love, unconditional
Be there for you, all season

And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah

I made a vow, to walk with you
Through anything, life puts you through
Told you the world is yours and everything in it
Then you took your heart, for granted
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, never
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah

I was your eagle, you were my daffodil
And nothing would come between us, no, no, no
Now the fun and laughter, going to the park
And all the pictures we took
Now it's all gone away

And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
Baby girl I never,
Meant to clip the wings of an angel
When I was supposed to love you baby
For eternity
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me.
