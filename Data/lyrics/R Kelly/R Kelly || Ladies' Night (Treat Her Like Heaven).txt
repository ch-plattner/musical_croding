She's like the sun shining bright
A romantic moonlight
Like white clouds and blue skies
She's got diamonds in her eyes
My rainbow after the rain
She's my joy after the pain
Far away paradise
Make you wanna touch the sky
Like the highest mountain peak
As the ocean goes deep...

On Christmas she's Miss Santa Claus
Just like Grandma's apple pie
Girl you're all the reasons why
She's a comforter and friend
I tell you she's that peace within
She's the lover in my home
She's the strength when I'm not strong
Every day my valentine
I'm so glad heaven made her mine...
