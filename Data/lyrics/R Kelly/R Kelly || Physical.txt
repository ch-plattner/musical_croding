[Intro:]
Uh
Alcohol music
Hello, baby
I just called to let you know I’m back

[Verse 1:]
Roll up, smoke up
In the air you better close that door up
Let’s get physical (let’s get physical)
Baby, I’m so into you (I’m so in, I’m so into you)
It’s just me and you
Up in this room so show me what it do
Girl, show me how you move
As soon as you take it off, off, off
I promise I’mma touch it, I’ma kiss it, I’ma lick it
Have you climbing up the wall, ‘all, ‘all
So bring your body here to me

[Hook:]
Let’s get physical (physical)
Girl, tonight, candle lights
Burning while we’re makin’ love
Let’s get physical (physical)
Climb on up in this bed
While I’m pulling your hair
Let’s get physical, oh, oh
Girl, I need it, I want it
All night ‘til the mornin’
Physical (physical)
Let’s get physical
Baby

[Verse 2:]
Liquor (liquor), sip up (sip up)
Girl, you got that Lava Flow in your cup
Staring at it like you want that
I’m trying to get behind that
Pop that, spread that
Til I got you asking me where your legs at
Just me and you
Up in this room so show me what it do
Show me what it do, yeah
Girl show me how ya move
As soon as you take it off, off, off
I promise I'mma touch it, I'mma kiss it, I'mma lick it
Have you climbing up the wall
So bring your body here to me (bring your body here)

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Just keep doing what you doing
You gon’ make me take you down
Like I’m about to wrestle you
(Let me take you down, girl, I wanna take you down)
Promise girl on everything I love
I’m gonna do my best to pleasure you
(Let me take you down, girl, I wanna take you down)
Back curled and your head up
Ass shining; Jacob
Hair and makeup all messed up
Adidas back cause I’m scratched up
Them niggas nice, but I’m fucked up
I’m in the club with my cup up
Like I’m askin’ God for a refill
Chicks on pole, fire drill
Club owner like “what bill?”
Real niggas y’all know what it is

[Hook]
