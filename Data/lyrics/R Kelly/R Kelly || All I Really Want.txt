Baby, we been knowing each other for a long, 
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything. 

[Verse 1:]
Here we are, just sittin' here 
Knowin' we're all alone 
My Rolley's lookin' at me 
Sayin' it's time to get it on 
You know what I want 
And baby, I know what you need 
So stop hesitatin', girl 
And give your love to me. 

[Chorus:]
All I really want is to love you, babe 
Make your body feel like heaven, babe 
I just wanna satisfy ya, babe 
That's all I want, that's all I want 
I just wanna give ya somethin', babe 
Just wanna keep it comin', babe 
I just wanna make you happy, babe 
That's all I want, that's all I want. 

[Verse 2:]
Though the fireplace is burnin' marshmallows just right 
To who it may concern 
You won't be comin' home tonight 
Body parts that he DON'T kiss 
Girl, I will kiss for you 
Just put this CD on the repeat 
And let me pamper you. 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now the swimmin' pool's out back 
Come on and skinny dip, baby 
Eat breakfast in the morning 
That'll be complements of me 
In the middle of the night 
There's no need for morning here 
So hold your pillow tight 
Cuz I wanna do it again and again. 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(Til the sun comes up) 
Baby, we'll be makin' love 
(And when the sun goes down) 
Still we won't have enough 
Take this love to you 
I will take care of all you need 
Baby, lets asure 
I just wanna set you free, free. 

[Repeat Chorus til fade]
