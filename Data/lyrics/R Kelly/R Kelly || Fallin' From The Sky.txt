I don't know how to make it stop
I don't know how to make it stop
I don't know how to make it stop
(Nooo)

I got a phobia when it comes to heights
Even if it's a first class flight
And as a kid, I never really liked to climb
If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry
If I had a dream that I was flying,
Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down

I never ever wanted to climb a ladder
And I never wanted a house in the hills
I'm comfortable living in a big high rise
Cause in nightmares of getting killed
I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep
Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leave
Even if I was bummin' on the streets on the streets of Chi
You couldn't pay me to leave

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down

Girl I'm running out of time, come back around
Only a few seconds before I hit the ground
How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings?
Oh I can't breathe, no
Baby it's like I'm dreaming, got nothing to hold on to
I can't wake up girl, laying next to you
I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat

[2x]
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down
