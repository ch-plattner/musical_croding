
I wanna bring love, back to the radio,
Can I bring love songs, back to the radio?
I wanna be... tonight, while I'm loving you,
I wanna have to find my way,
And I don't wanna have a clue.
Just let the universe surprise me,
When I walk into your room, babe
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, babe.
Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling,
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you.
So, let's turn off all the lights because:

[Chorus:]
Babe tonight, I wanna be lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Girl, tonight!
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!

I wanna make love in...
I love feeling on you, yeah, babe!
And I don't wanna have to care,
You just do what you wanna do
To me, babe!
I wanna drift far out in your,.. girl,

And get trapped in your wilderness.
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, yes babe!
Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling,
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you.

[Chorus:]
Babe tonight, I wanna be lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Girl, tonight!
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!

We don't need no explanation
Cause this love will make our confirmation,
So let it do, let it do,
Girl, let us lose ourselves in this magic...
Now babe tonight!

[Chorus:]
Babe tonight, I wanna be lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Girl, tonight!
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
