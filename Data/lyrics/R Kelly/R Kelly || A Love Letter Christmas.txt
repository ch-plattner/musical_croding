
Do do do do do do do do do 
This is a Christmas remix 

And it's sang 
La la la la la la la la la la 
Baby 

Did you get my card 
Did you read my love letter 
Did it touch your heart 
When you read my love letter 

Pour the wine, read the signs 
Baby, it's Christmas time 
You and me underneath this tree 
Candle stories told 
Kisses under mistletoe 
And everyone's asking their family 

Did you get my card (Christmas card) 
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter) 
Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl) 
When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter) 

Sleigh bells, sweet dreams 
Kids are sleep, you and me 
Wrap the gifts I can't wait til morning 
Cuz, this moment's so heaven sent 
Marshmallows, hot chocolate 
Fireplace, you and me cuddling 

Did you get my card (Christmas card) 
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter) 
Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl) 
When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter) 

(My hope is) I hope these words find you 
I wrote this letter according to my love for you 
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are 
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box 
Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love 
Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder 
If you are reading this I hope that things are well 
And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail 

Did you get my card (My Christmas card, yea baby) 
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter, girl) 
Did it touch your heart (When you read it) 
When you read my love letter (My love)
