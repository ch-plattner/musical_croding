[Intro:]
We gonna let it smoke
What’s baby?
I wanna hit that
You wanna hit this?

[Verse 1 - Kelly Rowland:]
It’s 3am and I’m not with him
It’s the moment that I know we’ve both been waiting for
Now we can pretend we’re together again
In the dark letting this slow chill take control
And we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit and there ain’t no turnin’ back now
You already got my body gripped
Yeah boy you know I like that shit
So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin’ back now

[Hook - Kelly Rowland:]
Might as well go all the way
Hey there ain’t no such thing as a half mistake
So baby boy we might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
You don’t know if your addicted till you relapse

[Verse 2 - Kelly Rowland:]
From detox of lovin’ each other
If just for an hour or two or three
Till six in the morning
Do you have a good excuse
To be on the down low with me
In the tele suite
We know that we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now
I already got the Magnum glove
You already got your ass poked up
So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now

[Hook]

[Bridge - Kelly Rowland & R. Kelly:]
I’m right back smokin’ you
You’re right back injectin’ me
Love is in our veins ain’t it
I’m right back smokin’ you
You’re right back injectin’ me
Guess there ain’t no cure
We might as well go all the way

[Outro:]
You know you’re wrong for this, I know
And I know you’ve got somebody, Oh well baby
But he ain’t here no
So we might as well, might as well, do what we wanna do
You know how I like it, oh boy
Don’t it feel good to be back together
If only for a moment, a minute, an hour
For just one night, one night
‘Bout to hit it out the park again
Going, going, going gone
Going, going, going gone
Going, going, going gone
Close the curtains, potential remix
