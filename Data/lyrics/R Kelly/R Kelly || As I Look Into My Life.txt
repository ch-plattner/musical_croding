
As I look into my life 
Searching for that paradise

Oh Lord will you help me, find me
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine
And put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man
And change his mission
And put it in the hearts
Of many to stop confusion

[Chorus]
My sistas, brothas
Let's put these hands together
We need to stop chokin' on the truth
And start smokin' on a plan man
Love and respect that woman
And bring her happiness
I'm talkin' to the ghetto
For each other we should help
While our babies are dying in the street
We've got to be saying to ourselves
