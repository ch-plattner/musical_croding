I'm over by the pool drinking Belvedear
Ain't no haters up in here

Thats all I see from the front to the rear 
Socks and house shoes wit Polo gear
500 to the biggest booty in here
Come here girl(give daddy hug)
Don't Play me like I'm one of these scubs
Girl if you don't get yo ass over here and get yo ass in this tub
So much booty
