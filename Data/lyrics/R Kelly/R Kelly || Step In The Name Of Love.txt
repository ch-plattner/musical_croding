
Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone.
Similar to an old fashion song
(A thousand years from now
We'll be still putting it down my baby.)

You can change the frame, 
But the picture remains the same.
Similar to the sun after the rain.
(Thousand years from now, we'll
Be still puttin' it down my baby)

Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here).
Cause, my whole has been full of joy every since
You came here...Girl

[R. Kelly singing over (background)]

(Goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around,)
(Goes around, goes around, goes around, you spin me)

My whole world goes around, 
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna:

(Snap in the name of love, step in the name of love) (Snap my fingers) 
(Clap in the name of love) (Clap my hands yeah) 
(Step in the name of love) (Step from side to side)
(Groove in the name of love) (Grooove and it's alright)

Some believes in love,
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told.
A thousand years from now
We'll be still puttin' down my baby
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up.
It's like moving a mountain 
Love can be just that tough yeah.
(A thousand years from now)
(We'll be still putting it down, my baby)

Cause my whole has been full of joy since
