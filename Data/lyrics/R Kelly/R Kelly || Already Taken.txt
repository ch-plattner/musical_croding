Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then there was you (what what)
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then I met you (what what)
Girl you changed my mind

Walk up in the club 
Saw her in the club 
At first sight I fell in love
I’m not supposed to be falling in love
Cause I’m a hustler and a player
But she has the baddest body to me
Prettiest eyes I ever did see
Her smile had me going as soon as she did it
Cause shawty got a booty and man I gotta hit it
Lil’ mama doing her thing and I love it
On the phone making the swing and I love it
Get close and she don’t mind when I rub it 
And I can hit it when I want it

She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club
She wanna go too
I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then there was you (what what)
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then I met you (what what)
Girl you changed my mind

Imma spend my money on her
Pop champagne in the club with her
Hit the mall and take her shopping
I don’t know, maybe some diamonds for her
Cause she deserves a real balla in her life
And I’m that man
So if you feel me ladies
Let me see your hands

She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club
She wanna go too
I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then there was you (what what)
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then I met you (what what)
Girl you changed my mind

Cause none of these chicks can fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby
And none of these chicks can fuck with my baby
Fuck with my baby, fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby
Fuck with my baby, fuck with my baby

Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then there was you (what what)
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love (what what)
Then I met you (what what)
Girl you changed my mind
