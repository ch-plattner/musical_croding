Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, Knock you up

[R. KELLY]
Can you believe I'm in the club with a girl who has a man,
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand,
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates,
To much like my patrone man I'm just tryna take it straight,
Untill I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty,
Sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that shes a cutie,
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while,
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child,
Telling myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off,
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog,
Never felt nothing like this,
Shes more than a mistress enough to handle my business,
Now put that girl in my kitchen,

[CHORUS:]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
That's what I told her,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Like you are,
Knock you up, pregnant,

[TYRESE]
All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me,
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese,
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasy,
I can hide your co-star and get in one of my new wiis,
Tell me what your name is,
I can make you famous,
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing,
Now I ain't got nothing to do tonight I gotta wait for my crew,
I just wanna put some in you,
And I can tell that you want it too,
And I'm ready babe,
And your ready babe,
So let's go get out of this club,
Kel's and Rys after party,
You can fuck with us,

[CHORUS]

[ROBIN THICKE]
Oh this song has got me hungry baby baby
So tell me that you want me baby baby
And Girl I’ll love you till the sun shines (sun shines)
And girl I promise I will make you mine
Around the world in and out of clubs hangin out with chicks and
I don’t see nothin wrong with havin a kid
Ooh, ooh, sounds like heaven’s callin us
Ooh, ooh, and girl well that’s bout makin love
If you chose me I’ll guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I think b-o-t-h of us should leave this c-l-u-b
And get somewhere alone with me where there’s no phones to ring
And plant this magic seed

[CHORUS]

[THE-DREAM]
Your house my house don’t matter hit it up
Your city my city don’t matter give it up
Something about being with you makes me wanna a baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby
You can play all you want but I know you feel it to
For 3 weeks you’ve been talking bout extra bed rooms
In New York meeting with the realtor
There’s something you want to tell just say it I’ll kay it
Oh girl imma take care of you
And Imma still hold ya like we brand new
So don’t get it twisted for 30 somethin weeks
I’m still gone hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

[CHORUS]

[R. KELLY]
Take you out to eat uh uh
Wine and dine uh uh

Or selfish babe
Girl I’m just thristin for that booty baby
And it’s all your fault baby you look so good
It’s all your fault that it feels like wool
And you look so board up in this club so let’s go
We can hop in the Lamborghini roll to my big club
B-a-b-y (shorty) let’s go cr-a-zy oh let’s m-a-k-e a l-ittle Kelly
Baby I’ve got goodies and I want you to have some
All I ask is that you let me explore your secret garden

[CHORUS]
