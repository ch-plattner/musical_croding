Girl, you're mine, and I thank the Lord for you
'Cause ain't no other girl ever did me like you do
And all those times I did you wrong you stayed
Got my back, sheltered me from my enemies
Shared my pain even when it was all because of me
Make me throw up both my hands and say

Oh, there's somethin' religious about you
I wanna testify
There's somethin' church about you
And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl

Hey, there's somethin' religious about you
Girl, there is
There's somethin' church about you
Tellin' everywhere I go, I want the world to know

There's no other way to explain just how I feel
Kinda like the R in R 'n' B, who's the big deal
And that's why I'm on my knees, oh

Because of you, girl, I repent and change my thuggish ways
Got a playa wakin' up extra early on Sunday
And you always prayin' for me, oh, that's why I say

There's somethin' religious about you
I wanna testify, oh
There's somethin' church about you
And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl

Oh, there's somethin' religious about you
I can't put my finger on it
There's somethin' church about you
Gonna tell it everywhere I go

You make, you make me better, this is forever
Just say, just say the word
I remember, baby girl, it's whatever

When I was trapped you was the key that set me free
Out the streets, baby, you rescue me, I call you

You're my hero, you're my miracle
You're my miracle, there is no other, no
Baby, you remind me of my mother
And that's why I'm sayin'

There's somethin' religious about you
There is somethin' religious about you
There's somethin' church about you
Somethin' church about you
And I'm glad that you're my girl

Listen, all those times I lied
There's somethin' religious about you
Hey, all those times you forgave me
There's somethin' church about you
I broke your heart and made you cry
Cheated on you and you took me back, yes, you did

It's somethin' religious about you
See I know there somethin' about you
Somethin' church about you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
That you're my girl

There's somethin' religious about you
There's somethin' church about you
