[Chorus]
Trade in my life 
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you

Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down, I need you around
I'm willing to trade in my life

[Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here 
Reminiscing on what we used to share
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away
Tell me will I see you again someday?

Now the past is gone away 
But tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down
And I need you around - trade

[Chorus]

We both know that we made a vow 
Said we'd always be together
That our love would endure, yes
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it

[Chorus]

I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it

And I don't even have to think about it twice
Hey, I'll trade it
Somebody help me say I'll trade it
Until you return to me
I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees
And when I see you I'm gonna stand up
And reach my hands out to you, and trade it

Said I love my music and I love my fans
But I've got to step back
Look at this thing like it sure enough is
Tell me do you remember when we used to say
Everything is in their love tell me

What does it profit a man
To gain the world and lose his soul?
I'm gonna trade it to be with you
