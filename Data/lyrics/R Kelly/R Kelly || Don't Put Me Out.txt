
Baby now I realize 
All of those times I told you I loved you
I just didn't show it
I'm sorry

Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out

I remember when you said to me
Don't talk about it be about it
I should have felt you when you said
To me that you were all alone
I act like I was doin' a favor
For you cuz you were wit me
Something let me thinking that whatever happens
This would be my home
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
How could I have been so low
(How could i have been so low)
I wrote a song all about it
(Took a pen and wrote a song)
Wanna hear it, here it go, from now on

[1] - I won't talk about lovin' you
Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you
I won't talk about comin' home
Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home
I won't talk about both of us
Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about makin' sweet love
Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love

Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A
Clothes and pallets on the floor makin' sweet love night till day
Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and call him Man
But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby I don't understand
All I know that is I was wrong
(Dead wrong, yeah)
How could I have stooped so low
(How could I have stooped so low)
I wrote a song about it
(Wrote a song)
Wrote about it, here it go, from now on

[Repeat 1]

Now all the money in the world couldn't add up to what you did
Cuz when I was down and out you took the burden off of me
I never thoguht that when I took her out somehow it'd cause me pain
I was rooming at the Drake, how the hell you found my name
Damn I was wrong (I was wrong)
How could I have stooped so low
(How could I have stooped so low)
I wrote a song, yeah
All about it, here it go, from now on

[Repeat 1]

I won't talk about lovin' you
Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you

Girl, open up the door and let me in this house, please baby
I'm tired of banging on this door the neighbors say I'm loud
Honey, I beg of you 

Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
Don't put me out
