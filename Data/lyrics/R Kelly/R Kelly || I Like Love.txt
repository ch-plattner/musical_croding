[Intro]
First of all you gotta understand
This album is not about
Me trying to show somebody I can do reggae music
Or I'm reggae or anything like that
This song is about is about reaching the masses
You know what I sayin?
As a matter of fact
The whole MVProject is really about 
It's not about R.Kelly shinin
It's about me shinin the light 
On my people in Jamaica with my music
Cause I got fans there and they love me
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
Don't like confrontation
Don't like inconsideration
Don't like false accusations
Can't stand victimization
Don't like starvation
Oh I never liked discrimination
It's not all about separation
It's about healing the nations

[Chorus x4]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Verse 2]
I don't like aggravation
Don't like humiliation
And I can't stand defamation
And I really don't like temptation
Don't like exploitation
I don't like decamation
It's not about tribulations
It's all about salvation

[Chorus x4]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Bridge]
It's all about love
No matter where I go there's this one thing I know yeah
It's all about love
City to city when I'm up in the club yeah
It's all about love
Oh block to block all around the world holla
It's all about love
And if you feel me real people then put your hands up

[Chorus x4]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Outro]
Yeah I hope ya'll understand
You know what I'm sayin cause
There's people out there that
You know fans that will probably never get to see me
I'll probably never get to see them
But I want them to know that I love em
I appreciate them for supportin R.Kelly
You know what I'm sayin
The different countries
All different cultures
The world
Ya'll made me who I am
And I just wanna take this song to say thank you
God bless you and your families
Peace
