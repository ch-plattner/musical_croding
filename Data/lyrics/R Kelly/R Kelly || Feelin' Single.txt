
I can't believe you're playing me like this,
I thought the love we shared, the good times we've had. Remember?
Yeah

Feels like it's over,
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else.
Gave me the cold shoulder
But that's her loss, cause I can find me somebody else

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around
Then two can play that game, baby

You got me feeling single,
About to get up.
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me, girl.
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
Take somebody home with me

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
We can get it, baby
Get it, get it
Now I'm better single

She said 'forever'
Turned out to be the biggest lie
Of all time
And she changed my weather
Rainin' all day
No chance of sunshine

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends.
If she wanna fool around,
Then two can play that game, baby

You got me feeling single
Feeling single,
About to get up.
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me.
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
And take somebody home with me.

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Till the morning, baby
Get it get it
Now I'm better single

The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right
About me, baby girl.
And I might as well (I might as well)
I might as well get out a mingle, girl
Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single

Yeah
And I don't wanna do it, baby,
But you're gonna make me
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me,
Treat me right, baby
Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby.
And she's gonna love me, baby
And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby
