When she do it, when she do it
Don't know... down bring it up and then she rap that thing on me
When she do it, when she do it hey hey.

Wow little mama got me
Off in the VIP like oh,
Shit ah in the throne got me
Off in the club like oh shit
Do the crown on the floor I can take it
Tryin get a little closer I can smake it
It's like a job she bout to make a killing
She drop that ass like she's falling from a building.

Don't know... down bring it up and then she rap that thing on me
When she do it, when she do it hey hey.

Wow little mama got me

Shit ah in the throne got me
Off in the club like oh shit
Do the crown on the floor I can take it
Tryin get a little closer I can smake it
It's like a job she bout to make the killing
She drop that ass like she's falling from a building.

[Chorus:]
When she do it, when she do it
Don't know... down bring it up and then she rap that thing on me
When she do it, when she do it hey hey.

Wow little mama got me
