Oh babe I know you gotta go
But you know i want to keep your love
Right beside me
All night and 
When the morning comes I'm ready to go
Again through the night babe

[Chorus]
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough

The way you give it to me
Baby I keep runing back
For seconds
Oh baby
And the more you give to me my baby is the more
I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough

And I call you my Ms. Fix-It-Lady
The way you fix me baby
You are my Ms. Fix-It-Lady
And when I'm fiendin for your love
You are right there
To give me my fix Ms. Fix-It-Lady
And ever since the first hit of your love
I've been hooked
And I I keep coming back and I I keep coming back
I keep I keep coming back coming back I keep coming back
For more

[Chorus]
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
