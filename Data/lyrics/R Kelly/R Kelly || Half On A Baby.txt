
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Your body, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
You're body, na na na na

Turn the lights down low
I'm ready to break it off
Since computer love
Been wanting to set it off

Like a hotel room
I'm checkin' into you
I'm diggin' like a shovel
All the things you do

Take a leep over the broom
That's how you're makin' me feel
Come on in this room
And let's keep it real and go

[1] - Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
I'm singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

Now tell me what the deal is
Are you ready to bump
It's gonna take a lifetime
To give you all of this love
So baby, open up
And get ready to receive
A miracle of love
Gettin' down wit me

Like a baseball field
Wanna hit a home run
Me and you get together babe
And raise a little one

[Repeat 1]

Set it off in a six
Baby, that'll be cool
Take a trip downtown
Between me and you
Trippin' on Perignon
Conversation like what
Not afraid to go down
Once you open up
After nine to five
You deserve some twelve
Makin' future plans
To be where I dwell

[Repeat 1]

From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waist line
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby

From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waist line
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby

[Repeat 1 until fade]
