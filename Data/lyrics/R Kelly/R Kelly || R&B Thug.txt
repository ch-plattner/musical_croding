In the Playa's Club
Checkin' at your body baby
Steadily tossin that cash flow baby
Cause you drive me crazy
Won't you be my lady?
Betcha I can make your body talk to me
(Talk to me)
All I need is my CD, bag of weed and some Cristie (yeah)
Then I'm gonna stroke you up and down
Messin' with your head
And when you leave up out my room
You'll be walkin' bow leg
I can keep your body comin' like a CTA
You're dealin with a true baller baby
Givin' you the keys to my Mercedes

I'm not gonna stop til' you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumpin' like an Impala
You slidin' that sexy ass down the pole like what
(What, what, what, what, what)
Come and get some of this
R&B thug baby

I'm just an R&B thug babe
Tryin' to get some ass babe
Do you wanna thug babe?
I'm just an R&B thug babe
Lookin' for some love babe
Do you wanna date babe

You're gonna trip, gonna trip
Gonna trip, gonna trip, gonna trip
When I show you my love jones babe
And make the room go black
Baby girl keep your body right there
I"m gonna sock it to you baby
I wanna hear you say yeah, yeah
NOw the sign of the knob says privacy
You and me
On the low, fruit bowls and whipped cream
We can get up on a fancy suite
Thugged out with some Hennessy
See, see, see
Lock your body up and throw away the key

I'm not gonna stop til' you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumpin' like an Impala
You slidin' that sexy ass down the pole like what
(What, what, what, what, what)
Come and get some of this

Tryin' to get some ass babe

Lookin' for some love babe

Now feel a knot down in my pants
While you breakin me off with a lap dance
Said it's getting me high, it's got me feelin' hazy
I'm goin around your body like a worldwide tour
I'll make yu say toot toot, beep beep
Pull up to my bumper baby

I'm not gonna stop til' you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumpin' like an Impala
You slidin' that sexy ass down the pole like what
(What, what, what, what, what)
Come and get some of this
