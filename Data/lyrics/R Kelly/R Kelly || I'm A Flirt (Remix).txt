[Chorus (R. Kelly):]
(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, "cousin"
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

[T.I. Speaking:]
Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
you better keep her away from me your dig.

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly
And yes, he's so cool
Hey shawty (hey shawty)
What it do
He's mad 'cause I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause (I'm a flirt)

[Chorus (R. Kelly)]

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
It's the remix
Now if you walk up in the club
With a bad chick
And she's looking at me
Then I'm gonna hit
Man jacking for chicks
I tried to quit
But I'm player homie
So I had to hit
While you buying her drinks (in the club)
Acting like you (in love)
Stunting like you (all thug)
We was (switching numbers)
She looking at you when I walk by
you turn your head, she winks her eye
I can't help if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what you all be thinking
When you bring 'em round me (mane)
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B (mane)
Do you know what that means?
That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the vip
'cause I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga
It's a player's feel my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
'cause I'm flirt with her (right)
He's gonna flirt with her (right)
And if she's licking that good shit
She gonna flirt with 'em

[Chorus (R. Kelly)]

Kells, T.I., T-Pain
Ladies, if your men ain't hittin' it right
Just call the number on the screen
I'll be at your rescue
