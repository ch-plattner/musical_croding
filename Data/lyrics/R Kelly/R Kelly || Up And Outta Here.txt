
I was so wrapped up in all of the finer things
That I never took the time to show ya
What you meant to me
Money, cars and ice blinging off clothes
I thought that I was hot, until you turned cold
How could my success go and deceive me
If I could turn it all back
Then all of this would be a dream to me
(ooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
Oh,oh
(ooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
Baby, baby
If you saw me in Church on Sunday You could tell
That I've learned my lesson well

[Chorus]
Never said a prayer
(Oh oh, like this)
Never shead a tear
(Until it was you I missed)
Never fell in love
(Like a bottomless pit)
I was so so tough
Till you were up and outta here

My pride had me thinking that being with me
You were blessed
Funny how you could ask for so little
And receive less
All of the fussin' and fightin'
Cause I was always gone
And even though I gave you a lame excuse you still hung on
Oh I don't blame you for leaving me
If I could turn it all back
This would be a dream to me
(oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh)
Ho, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh)
Baby, baby, baby
If you could see me on Church on Sunday
You would say I learned my lesson well

[Chorus]
