
La, la, la, la, la
We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror

[Verse 1]
The most incredible vision
The most miraculous sight
By far prettiest position
Reflection in my eye
Wish I could seize this moment
Then I would post [?]
Girl I would frame this picture
And keep it by my side yeah

[Hook]
Cause we look so good
We're going so hard
We're not gonna stop (not gonna stop)
Just look at you
This side view
Do you know what we are

We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror

You're so beautiful

[Verse 2]
It's like watching a movie
Except that it's for real (so real)
It's only right to call this
Lovemaking fairytale (yeah)
Cause I have never seen
Or witness quite a show
Your love so 3D
It's like I'm in the front row

[Hook]
Cause we look so good
We're going so hard, we're not gonna stop
Just look at you
This side view
Do you know who we are

We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror

You're so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Baby this is good for us
In this mirror making love
This ain't dirty, this ain't nuts
Scene from heaven above us
[?] under discover
I'm so glad I discovered
Sweet lovemaking treasure
Canvas needs a painter

We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror
We are beautiful in this mirror
