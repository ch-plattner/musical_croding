Then he gets back in the car and Tawn looks at him and says "Man where's mine at?"
Sylvester says "where's your what?" Tawn says "My suit!"
Sylvester says "nigga what make you think you can fit a suit like this?" "Man I'm slim"
"Shit nigga you be looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger in my shit! Just stick to the jogging suits and Timbs
And leave the suits to me" "Cheah whatever you say bruh-in-law"
"Tawn listen... cause what we about to go I'm gonna need your full undivided attention"
"I'm listen" Sylvester starts reminding Tawn of his past and situations like this
When he lost his head, and then he looked at Tawn and says,
"Now when we get there it'll be a whole lot of fine bitches in there, with drinks in they glass and they hands in the air
But don't get caught up just keep focusing on me
Then will go downstairs it'll be a hallway with a couple of pitbulls and armed security up the axe"

"Yeah I feel ya" "well make sure you do
Nah, they'll be a room will go in it it'll be about six or seven gentlemen there
Then they'll search and take my gun, say nothing just sit down in the chair"
"Man wouldn't it be better if I stand" "Nah because they don't like it when you stand
And Tawn, whatever you do don't stare"

"Jesus fellas, it's just a phone, I got a phone call, hold on"
It's Gwendolyn on the phone saying "Sylvester what's wrong you left out and didn't even eat"
While Tawn in the hallway mean muggin and sizing up the security
Sylvester says "Can't talk now put the food in the refrigerator; I'll get to it later"
Joey says "hurry it up" he hangs up and asks for a pen and paper
Now Tawn turns the chair around and sits down puts his hand up and says "asshole"
Security looks at Tawn like he goin shoot him Tawn yells out "arm wrestle"
Now security looks at Tawn like it sounds tempting but he hesitates
Sylvester's telling Joey if everything goes smooth this is what will make
And now Joey checking out the piece of paper, Sylvester checks his watch then looks up at his goons
Security outside laughing at Tawn cause it looks like he's about to lose
Then Joey looks at Sylvester and says "what is this a joke?"
He pulls a gun out and says "yes but I'm the only one laughing, nigga don't get your ass smoked"
Tawn's straining and looking at his watch cause he know his time is up
He breaks the table takes the gun and point it at the guards and says "what, what what!"
Sylvester says "guns on the floor" then Tawn says "guns on the floor"
Then Sylvester says "safe, open it up" Tawn say "shut them punk ass dogs up"
Sylvester says "get on the flo, Joey don't make me have to ask you again, open up the motherfucking safe!"
Joe says "forget about it" Tawn says "I'm bout to shoot me a motherfucker today!"
Joey goons start getting up off the floor
