
It's Saturday
I'm ready to go out and have some fun
Get in the club around 'bout twelvish
Me my homies hoochie huntin'
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin'
And everybody's on the floor
Moet, Alize

[Chorus]
Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin'
All I wanna do [2x's]
Summertime, Saturday night [background]

[Conversation:]
"Hey, what'cha doin'? [female]
"Chillin', strokin' the town." [male]
"Sure you don't wanna come over here?"
"Nah, I ain't comin' over there, man."
"What you mean you ain't comin' over here.?"
"'Cause you don't be talkin' about doing shit."
"Who you wit?"
"Don't worry about who I'm wit."
"See, that's why I don't call you."

It's time to be havin' a good time tonight
Music got you in the mood, you'll be dancin' all night
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin' and everybody's on the floor
I can't seem to stop thinkin' about you, baby
No matter what I do

[Chorus (2x's)]

I know you're here to party
Everybody work it out
Leave all your troubles behind
Let me see you hump and bounce

[Chorus (2x's)]

Help me find a way to that spot tonight
Kelly, won't you help me find a way
I can help you find a way

[Chorus]
