
Hey, me and my baby got into a fight
Man, it must've lasted all through the night.
By the time we rest the crawl at the crack of the light
We made love, now everything's alright.
All rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight
Said, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight
Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby
Everything gonna be alright.

Hey, bartender fix up a drink for everybody in here tonight
Smell in my face and I'm ready to rock
No bad news tonight
Where the band is crookin', the girls are looking
And I only want a night
We and my baby reunited
Feels so outside
Told her I was sorry, she said she forget me
We gon' make some love tonight
Where the joy is swinggin' and everybody's singing
Rock 'n roll songs tonight

Hey, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight
Said, all rounds on me 'cause I feel good tonight
Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby
Everything gonna be alright.
All rounds on me [x6]
Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby
Everything gonna be alright.
He-e-ey!

Oh, everything I own I'm gonna give it to my baby
Lou girl, know she drives me crazy
Last call and the party's over
We're going to a motel room and we're gonna make some love.
Shots on me 'cause feel real good tonight
Ye-yeah, I'm back with my baby
Everything gonna be alright.
All rounds on me [x6]

Said I'm back with my baby,
Everything gon' be alright.
He-e-ey! [x6]
Alright (alright)!
He-e-ey! [x6]
Alright (alright)!
