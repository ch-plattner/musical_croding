When you know how love is pure
And why is it so hard to trust
When we vowed that we'd be forever in love girl
And when the morning comes you'll see I'll still be right by your side
And you don't have to worry cause baby girl you're all mine

You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
Got to believe me
You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl

Tell me why
Should you ever have to wonder who's gon' love you right here for you
Girl tell me why
Should you ever have to question who's not gon' be loving you
Oh girl
Oh I
And when the morning comes you'll see I'll still be right by your side
And you don't have to worry cause baby girl you're all mine

You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
Got to believe me
You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl

Here and now
Cast all your fears away, girl
Take my hand and we will fly away
Baby don't you know that you are my world

You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl

You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl

You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
You are my world
My heaven
My whole girl
