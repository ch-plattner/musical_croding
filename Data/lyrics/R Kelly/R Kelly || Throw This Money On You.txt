
Drink all in my cup
Smoke all in my vision
You so turned up
Hittin’ all of these positions
Everything I got ‘bout to throw it on you
You Olympic on that pole girl you know what to do
So bring your body over here
Whisper the shit up in my ear
Girl our eyes are making love
We ain’t even gotta touch
You and me in this room
Ass moving like slow jam
Body’s calling on you
Make a nigga wanna slow dance
See I just wanna sip my drink laid back and look at you
Cause I’m so turned on by your presence girl that

[Hook:]
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Is throw money on you
Is throw money on you
Step in my private room (Step in my private room)
Step in my private room (And let me throw this money on you)
And let me throw this money on you (so much money)
And let me throw this money on you (so so so much money)
Let me see you back it up

Make love with your eyes
Don’t say a word
Talk with your body baby
Make yourself heard
The world gets so hectic I need an escape
And you take my mind to whole ‘nother place so
Do that dance you know I like
And I won’t let you out my sight
I can hear you screaming loud
And you didn’t even make a sound
What we doin’ back here
Ain’t nobody’s business
Way you movin’ your body
I just came to bear witness
See I just wanna sip my drink laid back and look at you
Cause I’m so turned on by your presence girl that

[Hook]

Damn girl you my type girl
Ass swole like it been stung by the whole hive girl
Hallelujah I’m just payin’ tithes girl
I can make it rain seven days and seven nights girl
I don’t know your name
But baby that’s the turn on
Dancing all up in this private room
With no clothes on
And girl we gonna fuck around
And make a baby in this room
Shorty let me tell you what I wanna do

[Hook]
