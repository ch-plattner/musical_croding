Heard 'em say man wasn't made to fly
And when he wanted to go to the moon,
They said he wouldn't make it past the sky
And with all odds against him
They said he'd never reach his goal
Said he didnt have the strength
To travel that long road

But I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
That I made history
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
Now the dream is real to me

Heard 'em say that the mountain couldn't be climbed
And whenever there's an underdog
They count him out everytime
Somebody say that the storm will never en'
And in the crunch of the game
They said that there's no way that team could win

But I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
That I made history
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
Now the dream is real to me

When the battle seems lost
And all your strength is gone
Just know that the winds are faithful
In carrying you home
Just believe in the power
The power of Love

I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
That I made history
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream
Now the dream is real to me
