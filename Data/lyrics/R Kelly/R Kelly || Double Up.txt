[R. Kelly:]
Alright now we got that out the way
Let's double up
It's your boyfriend
Look we're in the club you trying to deside whether you gonna leave with me
You don't know because you got your girl with you
Bring her with you
Uh, bring her with you
I got a place she can stay in my crib
Let's go

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Step up out the club with a dizzy head
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs
Im about to double up
You know im about to double up
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide
I got a freak in the front, and a freak in the back
Im about to double up
And you know im about to double up
Double up

[Verse 1:]
I fall through the spot Kell's on the prowl
I see these honeys and they're dancing all wild
All upon eachother whining real freaky
Im plotting how im gonna take them home with me
Maybe her cousin, maybe her girlfriend
I just wanna get them both up out of here
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib
Start off in my game room pop a little bub
And have them dance for me like they danced in the club
Oo they're so freaky and both of them horny
Shot some tequila puff some dro and now they're ready
Her girl holla out we're best friends
And then I holla out ya'll look like twins
Ain't no competition ya'll a couple of tens
And then they say Kelz tell us whatcha wanna do
Well I'm about to double up with you and you

[Chorus]
Step up out the club with a dizzy head
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs
I'm about to double up 
(One on each arm)
You know I'm about to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back
I'm bout to double up 
(One on each arm)
And you know I'm bout to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Double up

[Verse 2:]
Pimping don't stop when I walk up in the club
See a girl with a girl and try and get a group hug
Get em' to the hotel
Get some group love
Her (her) me man I just can't get enough
All up in my tub
Steady poppin bub
Who is she to you and she replied "First cuz"
Man I could tell they so naughty, naughty
The way they took me down like a forty, forty
One in the bed and one in the chair
One massage my toes while one braid my hair

In the private spot like two of these playas
In the car lot like two of these playas
Hatas saying damn how he doin this playa
Doublin up for me is like routine playa
I'm a go getta
Mix em up like I'm a dealer
Man three's company bitch call me jack trippa

[Chorus]
Step up out the club with a dizzy head
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs
I'm about to double up 
(One on each arm)
You know I'm about to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back
I'm bout to double up 
(One on each arm)
And you know I'm bout to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Double up

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm back up in the VIP
In a cloud of smoke
Be poundin surrounded by all my folks
Give me another shot
Damn the music loud
I'm about to mix it up and blend in in the crowd
Grip slip slide by the dance floor
Baby grab me by my hand say she wanna dance OH! (oh!)
Is that ya girlfriend peepin me out?
Sho nuff it must be cuz now she freakin me out
She get behind a nigga
Grindin on a nigga
Touchin on me
Whisperin in my ears
Damn it sound lovely
I'm infatuated
We evacuated
Now we at the crib it's
Two for the money that's the life I live
Kiss me, kiss her, now kiss each other
It's a trip the way ya'll make these chicks twist each other
Take your shirt off
Now ima take hers off too
It's double or nuttin baby that's how tha boss do

[Chorus]
Step up out the club with a dizzy head
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs
I'm about to double up 
(One on each arm)
You know I'm about to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back
I'm bout to double up 
(One on each arm)
And you know I'm bout to double up 
(I keep one on each arm)
Double up
