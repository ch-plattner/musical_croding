Can't you see we were meant to be, oh baby
Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby
Let me know if you're out of my life
(Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye
I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby
If chances are that I'm gonna fall off [2x's]

Memories like the corner of my mind
You know just what to do to make my love come down
I know just what you need, but you don't come around
Let me know if you're out of my life
Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby
I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus (2x's)]

I'm not gonna hold on to your lovin' baby
Look at what you're doing to me baby [2x's]

[Chorus (2x's)]
