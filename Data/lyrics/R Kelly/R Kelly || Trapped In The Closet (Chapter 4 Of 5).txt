
Now I'm dashing home
Doing 85
Swerving lane to lane
Wit fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
Going through my mind
I'm thinking about what imma do and who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
(Whoo whoo whoo)
Damn, here comes a police man
He drove right up on me and flashed his light
Then I pulled over without thinking twice
He hopped out the car and walked over to me
And said license and registration please
I looked up at him and said
Officer, is there something wrong
He said no, except you were doin' 85 in a 60 mile zone
Then I said officer
Let me explain please
Ya see the truth of the matter is
Is that I have an emergency
He said no excuses
And no exception
He flicks his cigarette and then gives me the ticket
Said have a nice day and walked away
I said yeah right and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did 70 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house and she screaming
Whats all that for
Then I'm like woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone
Then she said calm down
Did you forget
My brother Twan came home
Oh...
And thats all I could say was oh
Wit a stupid look on my face
Said I forgot he came home today
And she said that's okay
Because honey I understand
She said you don't have to explain
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start getting it on
And she started biting her lip
Grabbing me and making noise
Now we making love and she's my ear whispering
It's all yours
I said I love you
And she said I love ya, too
Then a tear fell up out my eye
Then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me
And said baby go deeper please
And thats when I start going crazy
Like I was trying to give her a baby
The room feel like its spinning
We keep turning and turning
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curling
The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild
And starts screaming my name
Then I said baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain
And she said please no don't stop
And I said I caught a cramp
And she said please keep on going
I said my leg is about to crack
Then she cries out
Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax
And I said cool
Climax
Just let go of my leg
She says you're the perfect lover
I said I cant go no further
Then I flip back the cover
Oh my God, a rubber...
