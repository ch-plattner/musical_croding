Chillin in my four point six at the light 
Bout to be VIP for the night 
Shorty in the drop top V made a right 
Pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice 
Jumped out the whip like I was the police 
Didn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze 
Got Friday on a DVD 
She's a baller and I'm a baller 
Wha-what? 

[1] - To all my hot girls 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my hot boys 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my Chi town niggas 
Fiesta 
And all my uptown niggas 
Fiesta 
To all my players and my hustlers 
Fiesta 
And if you sittin' on them blades 
Fiesta 
To all my honeys in the club 
Fiesta 
And if you rollin' with a thug 
Fiesta 

We be off in the club sippin lot 
Red eye deep in the club puffin' Lye 
Strippers in the back of the club showing live 
Soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out 
House on top of the hill 
Counting what? 
Whose gonna buy the bar? 
Got enough 
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up 
I'm a baller now where's my ballers? 
Wha-what? 

[Repeat 1] 

We pop Cris on a daily base 
Plus we got honeys all up in the place 
Bout to wild out in a major way 
So put your hands up if you made your pay 
Add a little juice to the Tangaray 
But let the ice show till the diamond fades 
Rockland sittin' on Capitol Hill 
Trackmaster make capital deals 

[Gotti] 
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blingy-bling 
And a big body sittin' on them gleamy things 
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream 
Kelly, R&B Thug and it sings to king 
Got PJ niggas in caprime green 
(Thugged out) 
Hot chicks down to do anything 
Cop them mo chicks 
Cop mo bricks, pop mo Cris 
Ay Kelly drop mo hits 

[Boo] 
What you know about them cats 
That be spendin' the dough 
Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo' 
Ride whips, hittin' chicks 
Blowin' twenties on drough 
To the club thirty deep 
Plenty of ice to show 
Mami say she never rolled in a six before 
(Fiesta) 
Never seen a young cat this rich before 
Yeah Kelly made the way for these niggas to blow 
Thugged out, 2G, Rockland for sure 

[Repeat 1 ]
