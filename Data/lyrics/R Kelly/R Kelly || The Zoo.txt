[Intro]
I wanna see (your body)
I wanna feel (your body)
I wanna touch (your body)
I wanna kiss (your body)
I wanna freak (your body)
Wanna sex
It's nothing like (your body)
(Your body)

[Verse 1]
It's like a jungle atmosphere
And we're two monkeys baby
It's like we're on a vine
The way we're swinging it baby
See, you're a tiger girl
The way you're scratching me
I'm a lion
In this jungle I'm a king
Girl, I got you so wet
It's like a rain forest
Like Jurassic Park
Except I'm your sex-a-saurus baby
You and me hopping
Like two kangaroos
Rattling and moaning
Out here in these woods

[B-section 1]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa
Those are the sounds I wanna hear
When you're moaning in my ear
Girl you're singing to me
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa
You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy
And I don't wanna be free cause it's

[Chorus 1]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way I like it baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Baby come and lay with me in my jungle

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I swear I'm about to go
Turn your body around and beat the skins like it's a bongo
A thousand birds up out the tree
Girl, like a swarm of bees
That is how it's gonna be
Climaxing you and me
Touch the root of your soul
Let Mother Nature take control
Over us is rain and leaves
So come on girl
Let's plant these seeds, yeah

[B-section 2]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa
Baby, those are the sounds I wanna hear
When you're moaning in my ear
Singing

Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa
(Oh yeah)
You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy
And I don't wanna be free cause it's

[Chorus 2]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way I like it baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Baby won't you come and lay in my jungle

[Bridge]
Ya'll don't understand
Like two cheetahs running free
African butterfly to me
You're my safari fantasy
Girl this is heaven to me
Baby we are like coconut and banana trees
(It's a tropical)
Tropical chemistry
Like the wild life
I'm doing you baby
(I'm doing you baby)
You're doing me baby
(You're doing me baby)
It's you and me
(It's you and me)
Going wild

[Chorus 3]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way (Oh baby) I like it baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
So baby come and lay with me in my jungle

(I don't wanna break free 'cause this is)
Wild like a zoo
Just the way I like it baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Girl come and lay with me in my (lay with me) jungle

(Girl I like it cause it's)
Wild like a zoo (Wild like a zoo)
Crazy me and you (Crazy me and you, Yeah)
Heated animals (Heated animals)
Girl come and lay with me in my jungle

[Outro]
And the whole jungle goes
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa

Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa

Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa

Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Aaa aaa aaa aaa
