Juicy J in the building
Woaah

Grab on it
Turn you over, find that spot like there's a map on it
Call my [?] will be the way that shawty snaps on it
I keep that pussy cummin' like I ran a tab on it
Hey we in here flexin' like it's nothin'
Runnin' and we bumpin'
Booty so big got a nigga hearin' trumpets
Sit it on my face like ba-da-bum-bum-bum
Make shawty make it clap like ba-da-bum-bum-bum
I'm gone throw this cash here, we gone lap it up
Purple on deck baby, we can smoke it up
She know what she doin' in that see through lingerie
I'mma have this room soundin' like a Mardi Gras parade

She blow me like a tuba
I beat it up like a snare drum
That girl make me want it
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band

[Juicy J:]
She like it on her chin like a violin
And she be dancin' like a Majorette
Wetter than a river and I'm divin' in
Everyday a good day for sex
Four in the mornin' just like two in the evenin'
Take her into my world now ain't no way she leavin'
Give her just what she need
Take her smoke and a breather
Ass soft as a feather, I TKO it, Mayweather
In the lobby Four Seasons with like ten or twelve broads
All headed to my suite, it's a million thot march
Only thing we ain't about to do is sleep
Beat it like a drum, it sound like we at a Jamboree

She blow me like a tuba
I beat it up like a snare drum
That girl make me want it
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band

After the party she gone leave with me
Yeah we gone lay up for the freakin' weekend
And I'mma have her soundin' like a symphany
After the party she gone leave with me
Yeah we gone lay up for the freakin' weekend
And I'mma have her soundin' like a symphany

She blow me like a tuba
I beat it up like a snare drum
That girl make me want it
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band

It be soundin' like a marching band
