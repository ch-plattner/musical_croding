[Intro]
Hey baby
I’m back
Seems like I was gone for a while
But I’m coming over there
Right now

[Verse 1]
Forget the lingerie, girl skip the G string
Don’t wear no silk gowns, tonight no teasing
Vicky secrets, no earrings or bracelets
Once I walk in, I wanna see you butt ass naked

[Bridge]
Skin is all I wanna see
Girl, you look so good to me
Girl that body turns me on
Tonight I wanna see you with (nothing on)

[Chorus]
Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on)
No playboy bunny outfit (not even a thong)
Girl all I wanna know is you’re all alone
Sittin' there with nothing on

[Verse 2]
Now you look good in your boy shorts
And your smiley face panties
But tonight is different, I just wanna see body
Don’t come to the door in a towel
Just come straight out the shower
I hope that you’re ready cause I’ll be hittin' it for hours

[Bridge]
Skin is all I wanna see
Girl, you look so good to me
Girl that body turns me on
Tonight I wanna see you with (nothing on)

[Chorus]
Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on)
No playboy bunny outfit (not even a thong)
Girl all I wanna know is you’re all alone
Sittin' there with (with nothing on)

[Verse 3]
Girl I heard Walmart got a sale goin' on
Fifty per cent off on all lingerie (oh)
And I know you like to shop there
But tonight we’re going nowhere
Girl, this ain’t a pajama party
You don’t need no underwear

I'm gonna pull up in your drive way
Get up out my coupe, babe
Open the door, oh my goodness, turn around
I know just where to put it (nothing on)

[Chorus x2]
Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on)
No playboy bunny outfit (not even a thong)
Girl all I wanna know is you’re all alone
Sittin' there with (with nothing on)
