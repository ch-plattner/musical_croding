[1] - Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Repeat 1]

Now I've been around the world and seen so many things
Partied in every club nothing but VIP
I never take for granted these luxuries I have
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

I used to play the game, at night the same old same
Dreamin' about city lights it was my only lie
And now it's world wide shows
As if I can fly on over 
Now I can't go nowhere without the whole world due to know

[Repeat 1]

I used to dream about this life
Now I'm sitting on first class flights
Now they all wanna know

[Repeat 1 until fade]
