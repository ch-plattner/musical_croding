Slowly going in hand on her mouth
Bout to have sex while it's people in my house
She ain't really caring nothin bout the party
Tryin to keep her calm but she so naughty
Hand on her shoulder while I'm rollin it
Looking in the mirror while I'm stroking it
Then she pull away and I don't get it
She ready I can tell the way she poking it
Or except one thing she likes her mama don't know
how to act when I'm hitting from the back (yea)
Cause shes moanin loud and she scracthin me
Shes goin wild and shes grabbin me about to
make the bed break we rockin it break we pushin it
I know they're hearin it
But she don't want me to take it out keep going
And I don't really wanna take it out she says
there's somethin freaky about the other people
being on the other side of the door 

Shorty is a screamer
Shorty is a screamer
Breathe breathe hit it rest
Breathe breathe hit it rest 

Pulling on her hair
grabbin her neck
She give me full control the up most respect
And our love in the air our love in the air
She's about to make me forget that I'm a player
She yank me I spank her she say spank me more
I spank her again and now we all on the floor floor floor
Now I'm going lower lower lower
Then she turned over
She said she never had a man do it like that
I said I never heard somebody moaning like that
Cause she's bitting her lips and making faces
As I ram her hips we goin crazy about to make
the bed break we rockin it break we pushin it
I know they're hearing it
But she don't want me to take it out keep going
And I don't really wanna take it out she says
there's somethin freaky about the other people
being on the other side of the door 

Shorty is a screamer
Shorty is a screamer
Breathe breathe hit it rest
Breathe breathe hit it rest
Breathe breathe hit it rest
Breathe breathe hit it rest

She screaming so sexy
It's tropical like a fantasy (yea)
Deeper I can't control her because shorty is a
shorty is shorty is a screamer

Shorty is a screamer
She lovin it she lovin it
I'm pushing it

Shorty is a screamer
Shorty is a screamer
Shorty is a screamer (Yea)
She's a screamer 
She's a screamer (shhhh)

Be quiet
Girl calm down
You gotta be quiet
