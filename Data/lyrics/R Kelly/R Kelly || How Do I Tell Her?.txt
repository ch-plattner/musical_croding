
How do I tell her that I'm gonna wait?
When I know that she'll be begging me to stay.
And how do I tell her, that the time has come to part?
When she's, she's gonna take it so hard.
I don't wanna break her heart,
I don't wanna see her cry!
Cause I promised her forever,
That I'll be by her side.

So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?
Oh yeah!

How do I tell her that my path is gonna change,
When I know that her heart won't be able to stand the pain?
And how do I tell her that I'm moving on with my life,
When she's just gonna break down and die?
Oh, I don't wanna break her heart, no!
I don't wanna break her heart,
I don't wanna see her cry!
When I promised a girl forever I'll be by her side?

So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?
Oh yeah!

Listen!
She's been forever faithful, hones and true,
Yes she was!
My god, this is gonna be the worst thing that I ever had to do!
How, how, how, how, how?
How do I tell her, oh, that the time has come to part,
When I know she's gonna take it so very bad?
Yes she is!
I don't wanna break her heart,
I don't wanna see her cry!
When I promised her forever,
That I'll be by her side.

How do I tell her, tell her, tell her goodbye?
Bye, bye, oh baby, bye!
How do I tell her, how do I tell her, goodbye babe?
I want somebody tell me,
How do I tell her, girl?
Bye, bye baby!
Bye, bye babe!
Bye, bye babe!
Bye, bye babe!
