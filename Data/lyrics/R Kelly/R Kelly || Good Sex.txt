[Chorus:] 
I Can Tell Just By Lookin At Yo Body 
When U Walk Up In The Club Girl 
That U Got Good Sex 
And Even Though I Haven't Touched It 
Best Believe That I Can Trust It 
When I Look At U 
That U Got Good Sex 
And I'm Tryin 2 See What's Dat Like 
When We Leave This Club Tonight 
Cuz Girl I Can Tell 
That U Got That Good Sex 
So Put Yo Hands Up 
Ladies Put Yo Hands Up 
If U Got That Good Sex 

[Kellz:] 
Ooh My Goodness 
Sex At 1st Sight Girl 
When I Look At U 
Walkin And Talkin 
While U Strutin That Thang 
Across The Room 
Shit U Almost Made Me Spill My Drink 
All Over Me Girl 
Where U Get That Booty Girl? 
I Wanna 
Smack, Smack Flip It Up 
Jump On In Like Double Dutch 
Baby, Give Yo Hand 2 Me 
Let's Get Down On 23's 
And I'll Be Windin It Slow 
While Yo Juices Flow (Whoa, Whoa) 
Baby Girl Please Believe 
That Can't Nobody Please Yo Body 
Like My Body Can Please Yo Body 
And Girl I Can Back It Up 
Just Give Me A Chance To Sex It Up (Oh) 
On Yo Knees & El (Bows) - elbows 
While I'm Hittin It (Slow) 
Girl I'm Puttin On A (Show) 
Then Right After Sex 
We Can Spend The Night Together 
Wake Up 
And Be Like Whatever 
It Doesn't Matter 2 Me 
As Long As Ur Chillin Wit Me 
Said I'm Gonna Make Ur Body Go (Eek,Eek,Eek,Eek,Eek) 
Girl I Promise 2 Make Yo Body Go (Eek,Eek,Eek,Eek,Eek) 
Girl U Don't Have 2 Take Off No Clothes 
It's A Shame U Look So Good 
That I Wanna Hit It Wit Yo Clothes On 

[Twista:] 
Now When It Come 2 Cuttin 
Can't Nobody Fade Dawg 
Come N Get Wit The Twist 
I'm A Made Star 
Wit One Grip Of The Wrist 
Like Ray Charles 
I Know She Thick 
And The Dick Gon Stay Hard 
I Ain't Gotta Say I Fucked Her 
I Can Just Straight Out Fuck Her 
I Can Use My Mind 
When I Touch Her 
Pretty Skin Wit Yo Look Right Structure 
The Only Difference Between Us 
Is U On The Dance Floor 
And I'm The On Tip 
But We Both Be Grindin 
I Know That U Good Up In The Bed 
When They Bumpin Reggae Music 
N Yo Waist Be Windin 
I Love It How U Make Yo Booty Move 
When The DJ Go (Er,Er,Er,Er) 
I'm Love It When We Get Up In The Bed 
N The Headboard Go (Er,Er,Er,Er) 

[Chorus] 
I Can Tell Just By Lookin At Yo Body 
When U Walk Up In The Club Girl 
That U Got Good Sex 
And Even Though I Haven't Touched It 
Best Believe That I Can Trust It 
When I Look At U 
That U Got Good Sex 
And I'm Tryin 2 See What's Dat Like 
When We Leave This Club Tonight 
Cuz Girl I Can Tell 
That U Got That Good Sex 
So Put Yo Hands Up 
Ladies Put Yo Hands Up 
If U Got That Good Sex 

[Kellz:] 
Girl, I Wanna Hit It Wit Yo Clothes On 
Baby, U Don't Have 2 Take Them Boy Shorts Off 
Let Me Tell U Why 
Cuz I Got My Hand On Yo Shoulders 
Bout 2 Move A Lil Things Over 
Bout 2 Kiss U Down Yo Back 
Then After That I'm Gonna Cling On Ya 
(Muah, Muah, Muah, Muah) Gonna Kiss Yo Body, Kiss Yo Body Girl 
(Muah, Muah, Muah) Let's Get Up Out Of This Party Girl 
When U Drop It, Stop It, Roll It, Pop It 
Make It Jerk N Wind It, Work It 
Then Baby Girl I Already Know 

[Chorus: Til Song Fades]
