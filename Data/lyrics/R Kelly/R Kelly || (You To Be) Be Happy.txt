Everyday and night I pray 
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me 
Ain't the same without you G

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'Cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know
That I'm down until the day I die
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you
'Cause baby I love you

Every night and day I pray
Your love returns
Oh I'd give my life
If it would only make you happy

[Rap (Notorious B.I.G)]
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'
Spittin' in faces in public places
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Ya'll stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs
I regret Putting you on to Bagguettes.
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals
I made you - why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

[Chorus]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
Baby everything you want it for baby
You to be down with me
So give me that ass back baby
'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe

Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G

[Chorus]
