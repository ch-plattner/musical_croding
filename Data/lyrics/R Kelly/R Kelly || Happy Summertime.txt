Happy summertime Niggas ahh yeah
We rolling [x4]
Drop up in the summer time
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
And have a pool party, gets some chicks all swim I
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

Sun shining like california
Come here gurl let me push up on ya
Can we do how we do in a china hard day
Full of ?? club thus is Friday
Lets drink and hit the dance floor
DJ put the summer jam on
Big chips at the bar spending
GT with the wheels spinning
Let's get somewhere and get high
For the rest of the night
Sex and then gone get a bite
Ohh take with a thug baby and if u want it (if you want it)
You can get it pumping

And we rolling through the block 
With on the block with the beat making it hot for you...
How we do
And if ur girls looking at me I might have to snatch her up
When ur head turns
This is how we do... summertime

Drop up in the summer time
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
And have a pool party, gets some chicks all swim I
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

Slip and trip, we flip to new hit
Gots to do with with mr cool with
Because im better than the rest of them
I'm too stepping on lake Mischagin
Omg my nefphew done did it again
Pool full of woman he tryna get in
Well, c'mon, it's all cool
Ain't no rules, it's the summertime 
So we gonna act a fool
Watch u wanna do
Nawh watch u wanna do
Is rush me a plate of that barbeque
With a quickness move fast
Better yet move quicker
Then get my a 40ounce from kem with liquer
Slide by milenium book
One more spot to hit before it gets dark
Lake sure we drive
Slip till we slide
Summertime on the westside!.. westside... westside

We be rolling on most 24s
Cumming down ur strip
312 and 213 area codes
So that girls don't trip

Drop up in the summer time
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
And have a pool party, gets some chicks all swim
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

Drop up in the summer time
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym
And have a pool party, gets some chicks all swim I
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride [x2]
