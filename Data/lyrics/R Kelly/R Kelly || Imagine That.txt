
Close your eyes
Now relax your mind
Now I want you to picture yourself far far away
(Prepare yourself girl cause we bout to take a ride)
And I don’t want you to have a care in the world right now
It’s just you and me
In this moment… quiet
Listen

Baby take your mind into a zone 
Imagine that we all alone
Two ways are off and our friends are gone
Now it’s just you and me getting it on
Take my hand and come with me
Let’s indulge in fantasies
Cast your cares and worries
While we fall into this ecstasy

I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back
Imagine that
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me stroking your body
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Whip cream and strawberries know what I mean
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Candles and oils surrounding the bed
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me kissing your body from feet to head

Imagine that
We don’t have to talk
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk
Take a second and imagine the opportunity
You and me sharing sexual energy
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair
Then close your eyes and act like we not even here
Girl

I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back
Imagine that
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me stroking your body
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Strawberries and whipped cream know what I mean
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Candles and oils surrounding the bed
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me kissing your body from feet to head

Yeah

Imagine
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that [Baby] imagine imagine that

That I’m stroking your body
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Strawberries and whip cream imagine that
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Ohh baby candles and oil surrounding the bed
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Imagine I’m taking off my clothes baby
Hey

Take off all your clothes baby
Imagine that

Cause you owe me baby
And I want you baby
So let it take control
Hey

From feet to head
Its your and me in the bed
Screaming baby
Say my name say my name say my name say my name say my name
Ohhhh
