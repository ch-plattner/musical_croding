Tossin money like it's snowin in the club (Rewind that)
Didcha see lil mama drop it down on the floor (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
It's like I'm in the zone clownin on liquor (Rewind that)
Haters keep quiet, put that money on the floor (Rewind that)
Kels and Flo-Rida in the spotlight (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)

The way you dip to the floor
I wanna see that again
Been in this club since four
But I got my second wind
And plus I'm hugging the bottle
Like it was my best friend
And that bottle got me feelin like the devil within
Tonight I'm ready to go
We look ready to win
Party like never before
Then do it all again
So rewind, like the number one play of the week
So rewind, like @#$%^ like I'm the man of the week
I got these honeys in the critan line
Money got hangtime
Board keep scoring like you got the game on rewind

Like a big game I pull up to the club (Rewind that)
Tossin money like it's snowin in the club (Rewind that)
Didcha see lil mama drop it down on the floor (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
It's like I'm in the zone clownin on liquor (Rewind that)
Haters keep quiet, put that money on the floor (Rewind that)
Kels and Flo-Rida in the spotlight (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
Rewind (Rewind that)
