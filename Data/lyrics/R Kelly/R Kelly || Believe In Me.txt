Baby, if we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it together
That's right, you can do this

I'll been gone for a minute, no you cant take it
The Lords walkin with me so, I'm gonna make it
Girl dry your eyes, Baby be strong
Look at me I'm gonna really need ya to be strong
Girl for the both of us, and for our family
I can make it if you just stay beside me
Hold it together up until my returning
Light a candle, read a scripture from a journey
I know that heavens gonna make a way for me
So write a kiss on a letter send it to me
An I'ma think about ya everyday
But until the sun shine my way

Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me
Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me
Gil, while I'm gone just know
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
I'll be back for you
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
Wait on me and I'll come back to you

Ya so tough, smile through this sh, and Baby walk with ya head up
Don't let em tell ya thatâ€™s the end of me (no no)
I'll be back just like the boomerang
You ain't really gotta worry bout nothing
I'm not a dummy, I stashed something (baby)
For you an me girl when I get out
And believe me I'm gonna get out
And I'm gon take you straight out the hood
You gotta know this ain't forever babe
You gotta know we goin' make it to a better place
Until then I'll be thinkin' bout you everyday
Til the sun shine my way

Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me
Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me
And whenever I'm gone just know
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
Girl I'll be back for you
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
Wait on me and I'll come back to you

Girl save ya strength you're gonna need it to be there for me
All odds against us and I hope you still believe in me
Cuz I believe in us you know I'm all about our destiny
And let no man take us under. Rise to our victory,
Turn back the hand of time, reminisce the memories
Put yo hand in mine walk with me spiritually
In a minute of the storm with the pourin' rain

Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me
Girl, I'ma need ya to believe in me (in me)
And whenever I'm gone just know
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
Girl I'll be back for you
Hey wait on me
Baby just wait on me
Girl I'ma need ya to believe
Hey you the matter
Hey you the matter
Believe in me hey
Whenever I'm gone just know
I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, 
oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back, oh, I'll be back
Just wait on me and I'll come back to you
