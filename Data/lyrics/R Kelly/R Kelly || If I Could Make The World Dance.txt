Signs and wonders that the television shows
Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know
That life is a stage and we're all in the show
Starring the World, cause we all blow

(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
If we just give each other a chance
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
We might just fall in love

Picture us (in a land)
Where there's no more (no more war)
Shaking hands with my (brother)
And respecting my my my (my sisters)
(I'm offering) a dance that heals
(A melody) you can feel
Love is the key
All it takes is you and me

If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance)
Then they would dance something like this
If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove)
Then they would groove something like this
If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing)
Then they would sing something like this
If I could make the world love (if I could make them love, if I could make the love one another)
Then it would be something like this

Tell me why can't more hungry people overcome
When they've got the means to build bombs, yeah
We're so quick to say God Bless America
But take away In God We Trust
Tell me what the hell is wrong with us

(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
If we just give each other a chance then
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
We might just fall in love

Picture us (in a land)
Where there's no more (no more war)
Shaking hands with my (brothers)
And respecting my (sisters)
I'm offering (I'm offering) a dance that heals
(A melody) you can feel
Love is the key
All it takes is you and me

If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance)
Then they would dance something like this
If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove)
Then they would groove something like this
If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing)
Then they would sing something like this (if I could make the world)
If I could make the world love
Then it would be something like this

Happy people baby
Dance with me mama (come on)
Dance with me mama (yeah)
Dance with me mama (oh)
Dance with me mama (come on and)
Dance with me mama (dance with me)
Dance with me mama (oh)
Dance with me mama (come on)
Dance with me mama 
Dance with me mama
Dance with me mama (woah)
Dance with me mama (come on)
Dance with me mama (dance)

People, there's got to be 
A place that we can go
And dance out the day
So meet me at the 
Spot that we used to go
And just step the night away
Please let's just rewind time
And go back because I miss those days

If I could make the world dance (woah if I could make them dance)
Then they would dance something like this
If I could make the world groove (woah if I could make them groove)
Then they would groove something like this
If I could make the world sing (woah if I could make them sing)
Then they would sing just like this (if I could make the world love)
If I could make the world love (I surely would)
Then it would be something like this

If I could make the world (if I)
If I could make the world (could make)
If I could make the world (the world)
If I could make the world (oh if I)
If I could make the world (oh I)
If I could make the world 
If I could make the world...

Chocolate Factory
If I could make the world dance
I truly would
Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one ya'll
Just as Frankie Beverley inspired me to write love street
You know every day is a special occasion ya'll
You know why? Cause you woke up this morning
Happy People baby
