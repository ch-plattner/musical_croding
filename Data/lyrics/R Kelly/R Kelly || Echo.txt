You aint got a clock in the night 
Girl I wanna hear you echo (echo), wanna hear you echo (echo) 
I called your boss and he knows you aint comming in today (sex in the morning, sex all day) 
So baby girl pack a bag and head to my place (sex in the morning, sex all day) 
And when you get there don't stop don't hesitate (sex in the morning, sex all day) 
I left the keys so let your self in baby (sex in the morning, sex all day) 
Now drop your bags pour yourself a drink 
I left your next clue by the sink 
It should be a box with your name 
Open it up see what inside whatever it is put it on 
And head to the bedroom 
And I'll be waiting for you right there baby 
I'll be waiting there to -- like crazy 
I hope your ready to go all day long 
I hope your ready girl to scream and moan 
Like yodel-lehee yodel-lehee oohhooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhoo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) 
The way you riding it I can tell you like my surprise (sex in the evening, sex all night) 
Now I'm working it up n down like a roller coaster ride (sex in the evening, sex all night) 
I got your eyes rolling back finger nails in your spine (sex in the evening, sex all night) 
We never had a sex session like this one in your life (sex in the evening, sex all night) 
Now when we finally get to round 10 we not gon stop we'll start again 
And when you need a break I'll let you up, I'll let you breathe, wash your face, get something to eat 
Then come back to the bedroom 
And I'll be waiting for you right there baby 
I'll be waiting there to -- like crazy 
I hope your ready to go all day long 
I hope your ready girl to scream and moan 
Like yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhhooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhoooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) 
Even though were in this room just you and me 
I got you sounding like your screaming from a mountain peak 
And you don't wanna come down (noo) and I dont want you to come down (noo-ooohh) 
So girl lets keep coming and we gon go to heaven from this room 
And the gates will open up when they see it's me n you 
Ooh so run lock the door come back in girl I got my second win 
And ill be waiting for you right there baby 
I'll be waiting there to pin it like crazy 
I hope your ready to go all day (night) long 
I hope your ready girl to scream and moan 
Like oley oley ohhoooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhoooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) 
And I'll be waiting for you right there baby 
Ill be waiting there to -- like crazy 
I hope your ready to go all day long 
I hope your ready girl to scream and moan 
Like yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhoooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo), echo (echo) yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ohhoooo 
Wanna hear you echo (echo) yodel-lehee yodel-lehee yodel-lehee yodel-lehee yodel-lehee yodel-lehee ..... [fades out]
