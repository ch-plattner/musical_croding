If I told you that I placed the world right in your hands
And I'd rather be your man and girl
Believe that it's so
Believe that it's so
If I tell you love was seat down from up above for
Me and you to be together, forever

Believe that it's so
Believe that it's so

Now I believe in all these things
Soon one day come to be the best....
Just like I believe that you and me
Would let city for eternity relax
Baby I believe it

There's no mountain, there's no mountain we can move, no
Will, we will find strength in the groove... yeah

Now if I say this day was blessed because love we made it, made it
But I would be given my name and girl
Believe that it's so, believe that it's so
Believe that it's so, believe it so
Hey baby

Now if I say the dime is placed a new man in my heart
And givin me a brand new start and girl
Believe that it's so, believe it's so
Believe that it's so, believe it so

I believe that all these things
Will soon one day come to be the best...
Just like I believe that you and me
Would let city for eternity relax
Baby I believe it
There's no mountain, there's no mountain we can go, no
Will, we will find strength in the... yeah
