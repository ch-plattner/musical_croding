I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-uh-uh-ove

Trying to stop my head from spinning 
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please could you just close the door
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love 
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love now baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I just wanna use your love
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all)

I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song
Singin' this song song song song song
