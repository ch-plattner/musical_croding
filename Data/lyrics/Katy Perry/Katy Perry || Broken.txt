
I wear the red shoes 
With the holes 
To remind me 
What we went through 
Sit down here 
Kick 'em off enough 
Not had enough of you 
I tell you 
You know 
The car you drive 
Keeps breaking down 
And never starts 
Next thing 
I'm pulling up to you 
We're in the backseat 
Driving it home 
No one wants 
To be alone 

[Chorus:]
What do you do? 
What do you do 
When everything 
Is broken? 
What do you say? 
What do you say 
When no words 
Fit the moment? 
'Cuz you're not here 
And even if you were 
All I could say 
Is what do I do? 
What do I do? 
We're broken 
But I can't 
Throw us away 

The video 
Of our vacation's 
Chewed up in the drawer 
Beside me 
She thinks I never got 
To watch it 
I'm so glad 
I made a copy 
The sky 
Got bitter twisted 
Just like you and me 
I miss it 
You snap it 
Bend it 
Burn it 
Then you find 
That you can't fix it 
Fall back on whatever 
Still remains 

[Chorus]

Breaking you in 
Breaking your heart 
I was taking it all 
And I tore you apart 
Breaking me in 
Breaking my heart 
And the damage was done 
But I took what you got 
We were breakin' it 
Smashin' it 
Takin' it 
Lovin' it 
Hatin' it 
Drivin' it home 
And now I'm all 
Now I'm all alone 

Oh, yeah [4x]

[Chorus]

What do I do? 
We're broken 
But I can't 
Throw us away
