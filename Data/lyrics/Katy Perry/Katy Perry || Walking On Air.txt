Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica,
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

This is pure paradise,
Even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes, we make angels cry,
Raining down on earth from up above

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

Heaven is jealous of our love
Angels are crying from up above

Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
