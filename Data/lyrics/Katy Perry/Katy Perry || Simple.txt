
You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, 'cause they are more distressed
So they say--you got O.C.D.
And they claim you can barely read
But you say "Don't bother me with all of your reality"

But it could be so simple 
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show

That it could be so simple 
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

It could, it could be that simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems

We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

It is all so simple
Just deal with it
