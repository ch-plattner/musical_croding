
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
[Standard version:] 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
["Complete Confection" version:] You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus:]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
[Standard version:] 'Cause you ripped me off, your love was cheap
["Complete Confection" version:] You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
[Standard version:] I fell deep, and you let me down
["Complete Confection" version:] I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]

Now look at me I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I’m glowin’, oh, whoa
[Standard version:] You can keep the dog from me
["Complete Confection" version:] So you can keep the diamond ring
[Standard version:] I never liked it anyway
["Complete Confection" version:] It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah,
Except for me

[Chorus]

[Standard ending:]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

["Complete Confection" ending:]
This is the part of me, no
Away from me, no
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me..., no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
