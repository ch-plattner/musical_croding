
Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting them down
Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more then they ask for then the toe-tag generation full of regret
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather then end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin
I can't focus my attention

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
(I want you to remember me)
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end
