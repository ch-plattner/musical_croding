I know you're thirsty baby standing in the heat
I've got the juicy fruit, those sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink (ice cold)

Cool as a cucumber you're coming on to me
You say you got the ripest melons on the street
My honeydew and your banana make a treat

'Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

You'll have to count your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me cause I'm such a tasty treat (yummy)

I let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I even let you eat the cherry on the top
You beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (what?)

Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!
