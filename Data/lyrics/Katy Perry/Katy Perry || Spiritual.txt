
Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have gotten me speaking in the tongues

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one and mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holding hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a nirvana finally

Magical one and mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holding hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally here

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, you make me float)

This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, oh, you make me float)
