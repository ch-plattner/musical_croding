My mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won’t think twice, yeah

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you’ve been warned

I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!

Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime on my wristbands (yeah)
Cause I’m the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I’ll tell ’em all your friends with a southern drawl (yeah)

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you’ll be to blame
Cause if you stay

I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark! (yeah)

I’ll ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby
And now I've met a man that breaks me

(My mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots)

I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!
Straight for you heart (yeah, yeah)
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!
