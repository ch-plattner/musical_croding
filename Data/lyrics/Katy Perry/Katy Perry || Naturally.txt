
Did it seem
To disappoint you
Living alone?
By the banks
Of your dilemma
Out of control
No one seems
To give the answers
That you wanna hear
What you'd give
To find a welcome here

Miles and miles of lies
Behind you
Those were the days
So many lives
You'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise
That they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry
These bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits
The hours of silence
Finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender
Of peace
All the years of searching
for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found
A welcome home

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

I love you, I have
And I always will.
