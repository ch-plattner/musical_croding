
He put it on me, I put it on,
Like there was nothing wrong.
It didn't fit,
It wasn't right.
Wasn't just the size.
They say you know,
When you know.
I don't know.

I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no.
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
I'll come undone,
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah.

Snowwhite said when I was young,
"One day my prince will come."
So I'll wait for that date.
They say it's hard to meet your match,
Gotta find my better half.
So we make perfect shapes.
If stars don't align,
If it doesn't stop time,
If you can't see the sign,
Wait for it.
One hundred percent,
Worth every penny spent.
He'll be the one that
Finishes your sentences.

If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
He'll come undone,
And my world will stop spinning,
And that's just the beginning, oh, yeah.

'Cause I know you're out there,
And you're, you're looking for me, oh.
It's a crazy idea that you were made perfectly for me
You'll see.

Just like the movies.
That's how it will be.
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending, oh.

It's not like the movies, oh,
But that's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
You'll come undone,
And your world will stop spinning,
And it's just the beginning.
