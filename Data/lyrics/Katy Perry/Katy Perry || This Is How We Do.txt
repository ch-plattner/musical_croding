(This is how we do, This is how we do)
Oh oh
Sipping on Ros√©, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy
(This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's all neon and hazy
(This is how we do)

Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All my girls vintage Chanel baby

It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, and maroon lips, my clique hoppin' in my Maserati
(This is how we do)
Santa Barbara, chique, at La Super Rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y
(This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress
(It's how we do, straight stuntin' like that)
Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and it's Tuesday
(This is how we do yeah straight stuntin' like that)
Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money
Respect

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do
This goes out to all you people going to bed with a ten and waking up with a two
This is how we do (straight stuntin like that)
Ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

What? Wait. No, no, no, no.
Bring the beat back.
That's right

(This is how we do), oh oh
(This is how we do), oh oh
