
You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time every time when you touch me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one buzzing energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find a magic seed
A white flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet

I was on the brink of a heart attack
You gave me life and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we hear a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
