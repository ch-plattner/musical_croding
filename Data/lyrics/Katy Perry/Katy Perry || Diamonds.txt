
I've got people to see 
Places to go 
Deadlines to meet 
A reputation to up hold 
Its like a ton of bricks 
Breaking on my back 
Its like 
The force of gravity 
In full effect 

I got money to burn 
And I'm on the sake 
They bet their bomb on me 
Cause I'm their ace of spades 

I feel the walls 
Getting closer 
I'm like a bomb 
With all red wires 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe it means 
I'm gonna be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe this means 
I'm gonna be 

A diamond 
It wont ever bend 
A diamond 
Cause there ladies 
Best friends a diamond 
But there 
There has to be more 
Than what these pirates 
Are gambling for 

If not for the push 
Id probably be a pebble 
If not for the pressure 
Id be forgotten forever 
Just another stone 
Skipped upon the water 
Drowning fast before 
The other failures 

I don't wanna be 
A distant memory 
On your wall 
Just another cd 
That you burned 
And never bought 
Am I not worth it to you? 
After all that drama 
That we've been though? 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe it means 
I'm gonna be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe this means 
I'm gonna be 

A diamond 
It wont ever bend 
A diamond 
Cause there ladies 
Best friends 
A diamond 
But there 
There has to be more 
Than what these pirates 
Are gambling for 

Ooh oohh diamond 
I've gotta be a diamond 
(I'm a diamond in the sky 
With you standing by 
Now catch me if I fall) 
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh 
Yeah yeah yeah 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Oh, I've gotta be 
Oh, I've gotta be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Oh, I've gotta be 
Oh, I've gotta be 

I'm a diamond in the sky 
With you standing by 
Now catch me if I fall 
Into the arms of a coma 

All this pressure 
I've got pressure 
I'm gonna be a diamond baby 
I've gotta be a diamond 
Your gonna see 
I'm gonna be a diamond
