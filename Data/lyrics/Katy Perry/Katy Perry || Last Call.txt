Hello, hello I'm searchin' for a man
With love filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello, hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me cause it's my last call

For help...yeah help
For help...

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thrity-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me...

This life...yeah life
This life...yeah

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

[Music break]

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3, come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change,
Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
I'm calling on Your name

This is my last call
This is my last call!
