
I was living in a small mind 
With no lifeline 
And no messages can reach me from the outside 
When I looked out over the horizon 
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising 

Then it hit me 
Maybe bit me 
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me 
I didn't know exactly where I would be going 
But I had to let this river in me flowing 

What a ride 
When you open your eyes 
For the very first time 
A real surprise 

I started living outside of the box 
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

I was living on a fault line 
The fault was all mine 
And this unstable ground found me down half the time 
But I had enough 
I had to get up 
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff 

Then it hit me 
You won't permit me 
To be an individual 
Just doesn't fit me 
But I decided that it's going to be living 
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison 

What a high 
When you open your mind for the very first time 
A real surprise 

I started living outside of the box 
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

So long conformity 
And ambiguality is a new priority 
All it takes, for heaven sakes 
Is to figure out the face and learn to seperate 

I started living outside for the box 
Taking my time when I always used to rush 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I broke down the walls for my liberation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

Oh, living outside of the box 
Oh, living outside of the box 
Oh, living outside 

Ha ha ha 

I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 

Oh, living outside of the box 
Of the box, of your life 
Of everything that seems that nice
