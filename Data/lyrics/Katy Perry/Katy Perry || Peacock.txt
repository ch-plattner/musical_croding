I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock

Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, myster-mystery-ee
I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

What's up your sleeve? Such a tease
Wanna see the show-oh-ooh-oh
In 3D, a movie, heard it's beautiful-oh-ooh-oh
Be the judge and my girls' gonna take a vote
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

I want the jaw droppin', eye poppin'
Head turnin', body shockin'
(Uh, eh-eh-uh, uh, uh, eh-eh-uh)
I want my heart throbbin', ground shakin'
Show stoppin', amazin'
(Uh, eh-eh-uh, uh, uh, eh-eh-uh)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'mma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy I'll bet it's beautiful
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, to get loose, come on take a shot
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

I want the jaw droppin', eye poppin'
Head turnin', body shockin'
(Uh, eh-eh-uh, uh, uh, eh-eh-uh)
I want my heart throbbin', ground shakin'
Show stoppin', amazin'
(Uh, eh-eh-uh, uh, uh, eh-eh-uh)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'mma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy I'll bet it's beautiful
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock

Oh my god, no exaggeration
Boy all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear, I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End of the rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'mma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy I'll bet it's beautiful
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
I wanna see you
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
I wanna see ya
(Come on baby, let me see what you hidin' underneath)
