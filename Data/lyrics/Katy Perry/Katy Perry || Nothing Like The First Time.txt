The leaves were falling
I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips,
Grabbing hips,
Smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990
Had me down from out of town
I was California

Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave,
But hey,

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the T.V screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to Hell,
Is what they sell if you've done the deed

Oh, but what could be so bad
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard,

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)

La la la
La la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la 
La la la
There's nothing like the first time

It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot,
There's nothing like the first time

La la la
La la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la
La la la 
There's nothing like the first time
La la la 
La la la 
There's nothing like the first time

It's not like reading a map,
Oh yeah, I can give you that
There's nothing like the first time
