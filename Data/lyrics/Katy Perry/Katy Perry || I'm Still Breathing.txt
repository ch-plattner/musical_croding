
I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending
All the signs that
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving
My two weeks

Pick your favorite
Shade of black
You'd best
Prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus:]
'cause I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear
You didn't fucking care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus]

I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship
