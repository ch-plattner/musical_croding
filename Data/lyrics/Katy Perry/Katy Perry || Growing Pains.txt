
You would think
that I could find
a simple song,
a photograph of mine
To show this public eye,
what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD,
or speak
in eloquent philosophy!
I'm nothing more
than simply me you see!

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe
in so many ways!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through

I don't regret,
I'm not ashamed
that I haven't yet begun
to speaketh ways...
(As the wisest of men),
oh perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful
to be a part
of the family tree,
while The Man upstairs
does His work on me
It's a job that may
take eternity to complete

Just when I've learned
all I can,
those growing
Pains up
and kick on in again!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through

Time after time,
one more time and again,
will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives
that make us wise
But young or old
I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains
never go away,
so I'll just
keep on trying

[Music break]

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe
in so many ways!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through
These growing pains

Oh, baby don't worry
about a thing!

(Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you)
