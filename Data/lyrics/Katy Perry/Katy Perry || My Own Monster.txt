I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears

And I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

I listen to these voices 
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girls bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh, and I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

Where can I go, where can I hide
from these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me
