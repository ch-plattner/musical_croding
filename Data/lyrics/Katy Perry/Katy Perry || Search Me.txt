
Through this skin you see
My heart
Through this laughter you feel
My pain
Even through this mask you see
My face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

Growing up never comes
Easily
In Your hands, You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game
Of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are

My Father, my Father
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
the mysteries of who You are
the mysteries of who You are
