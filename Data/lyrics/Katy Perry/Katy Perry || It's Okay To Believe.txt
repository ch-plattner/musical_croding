This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity

I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve

If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh, oh, oh
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh

So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)

This was big for us
Changing you and me

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah
