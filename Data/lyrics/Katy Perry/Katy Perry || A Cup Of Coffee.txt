
I take these turns 
A bit too fast 
Trying to leave you 
In my past 
The CD skips 
Our favorite songs 
Our greatest hits 
Just don't belong 

I really love 
To hate this 
Love hate 
Hate love relationships 
Are over-rated 
Over my dead body 
Is how this will end 
He said it's over 
And I could go for 
Another chance to do 
This over again 

So this is it? 
After all 
We've been thru 
We call it quits 
And-a I'm about to 
Wash my prints 
Oh 
The little I had left 
He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 
Cover up copy 
And an overdose 

I pop these pills 
Like cracker jacks 
And the price 
That plays dice 
Just watching you react 
When your depressed you 
Sleep too much 
I'm not sure 
If I'm waking up 

It's over-rated 
Over my dead body 
Is how this will end 
You said it'd over 
And I could go 
For another chance to do 
This over again 

So this is it? 
After all 
We've been thru 
We call it quits 
And-a i'm about 
To wash my prints 
Oh 
The little I had left 
He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 
Cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 
Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 

I stood in line 
Without you 
I stood in line 
Without you 
And I don't tell you 
What it is 
I thought about you 
Well without you 
Is everything I've got
