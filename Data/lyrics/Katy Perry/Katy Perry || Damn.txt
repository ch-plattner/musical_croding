
We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
In case staring down at my feet
If I look up, the sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
But I just got to have the taste of original sin

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
Working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I got the fact that you get it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air cuz your crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

You got my tongue, its so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Walk through the door, and enter your room
Cuz this whole world lies but you tell the truth
Do you think I'm gonna give you up?
Your never gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean and I'm starting to drown

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

You got my tongue, its so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Damn, I can't believe it, I cant believe it...
Ooh you got me feelin good good good
