
The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves
But you won't hear a thing

'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up

I guess
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you

We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used
To something so right?

And sure I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up on us

'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All our dreams
Never will come true without you

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, don't give up on this love
