Under a silver moon,
Tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy,
I want your aura
You are my destiny,
My mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

Go down in history
Go down together,
Into infinity,
Forever
Your Cleopatra
Your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love,
A ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

[Instrumental]

(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (legendary)
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (oh, take me down)
La la la la la

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun (underneath the sun)
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (oh baby)

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la
