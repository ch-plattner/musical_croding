
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
(I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong?
(I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on
On the concrete

[Chorus:]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on
On the concrete

[Chorus:]
Falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue)
I'm crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go)
I'm falling from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
(I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on
(I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)
I'm not blind anymore...

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus:]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue)
Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go)
I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
