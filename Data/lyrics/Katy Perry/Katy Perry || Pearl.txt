
She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like mice and men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in

She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl...Oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world...Oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Moved fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they'd never ever met

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl...Oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world...Oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a—

Do you know that there's a way out,
there's a way out
there's a way out

You don't have to be held down,
be held down
be held down
be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
my world, oh, yeah

But I woke up and grew strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be a shell, no
YoU'RE THE ONE THAT RULES YOUR WORLD, OH
You are strong and you'll learn
that you can still go on

And you'll always be a—a pearl

She is unstoppable
