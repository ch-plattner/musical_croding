he was working his way back home now over many a ragged mile.
When he finally crossed the river and his father saw him near,
there was a joyful sound, for all the world to hear.

I listened to what the Good Book said and it made good sense to me,
talking about reaping what you're sowing, people trying to be free.
Now we've got new names and faces, this time around,
Gospel changes, Lord, still going down.

Jesus, He did not doubt His gifts, though He knew that He had not long to live.
He took care of the business of teaching us how to fly,
then He bowed His head and laid down to die.

I listened to what the Good Book said and it made good sense to me,
talking about reaping what you're sowing, people trying to be free.
Now we've got new names and faces, this time around,
Gospel changes, Lord, still going down.

Jerusalem I see you standing high,
but if you lose your salvation, there'll be no tears left to cry.
Now some men worship a Golden Calf while others are bought and sold,
and if we live like that, brother we'll pay the toll.

I listened to what the Good Book said and it made good sense to me,
talking about reaping what you're sowing, people trying to be free.
Now we've got new names and faces, this time around,
Gospel changes, Lord, still going down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Gospel changes, Lord, still going down.
