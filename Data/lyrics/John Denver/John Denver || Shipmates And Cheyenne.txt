
Shipmates and cheyenne, raindrops and crying haunt the dreams of an old, old man.
Candles and church bells, laughter and farewells revolve in his thoughts like the wind.
Stallions and blizzards, steelies and lizards drift in the meadows of time.
No sense of progression, of age and direction, no meter, no form, no rhyme.
I'll hold me one, just one rising sun long after daylight is gone.
I'll hold me one, one more rising sun till my daylight and darkness is done.

Kingdoms and cupboards, losers and lovers and evenings of blackberry wine.
Falling like sand, the memory of hands and kisses, and whispers and sighs.
I'll hold me one, just one rising sun long after daylight is gone.
I'll hold me one, one more rising sun till my daylight and darkness is done.
