
Once there was a way to get back homeward. Once there was a way to get back home,
sleep pretty darling do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.
Golden slumbers fill your eyes, smiles awake you when you rise.
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.

Once there was a way to get back homeward. Once there was a way to get back home.
Sleep pretty darling do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.
