
The world is fast becoming younger, the news is all they've ever known.
They've seen the wars, the hurt, the hunger, how will they choose when they are grown.
What do you tell forever's children when it's their turn to hurt and heal?
Whatever spins a grim tornado can also turn a potter's wheel.

Take a little clay, put it on a wheel, get a little hint how God must feel.
Give a little turn, listen to it spin, make it into the shape you want it in.

Tell with your life the bloody story, teach to they're dreams not burning steel.
It's not in bombs where lies the glory but in what's shattered on the field.
The potter's wheel takes love and caring, skill and patience fast and slow.
The works it makes are easily broken once they survive the potter's throw

Take a little clay, put it on a wheel, get a little hint how God must feel.
Give a little turn, listen to it spin, make it into the shape you want it in.

Some day some children will be digging in some long forgotten ground
and they'll find our civilization or what's left of it to be found.
They'll find the weapons of destruction, but buried deeper in the hole,
they'll find a message and a promise in the sand, the potter's bowl.

Take a little clay, put it on a wheel, get a little hint how God must feel.
Give a little turn, listen to it spin, make it into the shape you want it in.
Earth and water and wind conspire with human hands, and love, and fire.
