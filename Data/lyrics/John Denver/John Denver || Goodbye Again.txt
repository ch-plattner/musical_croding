
It's five o'clock this morning and the sun is on the rise.
There's frosting on the windowpane and sorrow in your eyes.
The stars are fading quietly, night is nearly gone.
And so you turn away from me and tears begin to come,
and it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you.
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again,
and I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go?

It seems a shame to leave you now, you lay so soft and warm.
I long to lay me down again and hold you in my arms.
I long to kiss your tears away and give you back your smile.
But other voices beckon me and for a little while it's goodbye again,
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again,
and I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go?

I have to go and see some friends of mine and some that I don't know,
and some who aren't familiar with my name.
It's something that's inside of me, not hard to understand, it's anyone who'll listen to me sing.

If your hours are empty now, who am I to blame?
Do you think if I were always here, our love would be the same?
As it is, the time we have is worth the time alone.
And lying by your side's the greatest peace I've ever known, and it's goodbye again,
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again,
and I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go?
