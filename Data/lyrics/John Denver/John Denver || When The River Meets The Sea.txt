
When the mountain touches the valley, all the clouds are taught to fly
as our souls will leave this land most peacefully.
Though our minds be filled with questions, in our hearts we'll understand
when the river meets the sea.

Like a flower that has blossomed in the dry and barren sand,
We are born and born again most gracefully.
Thus the winds of time will take us with a sure and steady hand
when the river meets the sea.

Patience, my brother and patience, my son, in that sweet and final hour
truth and justice will be done.

Like a baby when it is sleeping in its loving mother's arms,
what a newborn baby dreams is a mystery.
But his life will find a purpose and in time he'll understand
when the river meets the sea. When the river meets the almighty sea.
