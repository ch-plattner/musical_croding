Welcome to my morning, welcome to my day.
Yes, I'm the one responsible, I made it just this way.
To make myself some pictures, see what they might bring.
I think I made it perfectly, I wouldn't change a thing.
La la la, la la la la la. La la la, la la la la la.

Welcome to my happiness, you know it makes me smile.
And it pleases me to have you here for just a little while.
While we open up the spaces and try to break some chains.
And if the truth is told they will never come again.
La la la, la la la la la. La la la, la la la la la.

Welcome to my evening, the closing of the day,
you know I could try a million times and never find a better way
to tell you that I love you and all the songs I played
are to thank you for allowing me in that lovely day you made.

Welcome to my morning, welcome to my day.
Yes, I'm the one responsible, I made it just this way.
To make myself some pictures, see what they might bring.
I think I made it perfectly, I wouldn't change a thing.
La la la, la la la la la. La la la, la la la la la.
La la la, la la la la la. La la la, la la la la la.
