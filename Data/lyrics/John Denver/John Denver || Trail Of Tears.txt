
No more beautiful moons may we spend on our land, in the north the scarlet council talks of war.
And the long knives have massacred the tribes and burned corn,
we're not welcome in our homeland anymore.
There will be a trail of tears, there will be a trail of pain.
Jackson will have the Mississippi and the twenty-dollar bill,
but for us the trail is all that will remain.

No more songs of the hunters on the buffalo plain,
no more smoke from sacred fires touch these hills.
And the numbers of the people grow fewer every mile
and our children will not learn The Great Spirit's ways.

There will be a trail of tears, there will be a trail of pain.
Jackson will have the Mississippi and the twenty-dollar bill,
but for us the trail is all that will remain.

On the streets of Rapid City, on the road to Wounded Knee,
there is whiskey for forgetting every thing.
But the old ones say there may be time learning from each other
the way that it had once been meant to be.
But there is still a trail of tears, there is still a trail of pain.
Jackson has got the Mississippi and the twenty-dollar bill
but for us the trail of tears is all that will remain.
Jackson has got the Mississippi and the twenty-dollar bill,
but how long will the trail of tears remain?
