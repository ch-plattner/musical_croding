Jessie went away last summer, a couple of months ago.
After all our time together, it was hard to see her go.
She called me right up when she arrived, asked me one more time to come,
but living on an LA freeway ain't my kind of having fun.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

When we were just beginning, it was such an easy way.
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me,
she can live the life she wants to, yes, it's all right with me.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

I'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of concrete and steel.
I'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some starry field.

Oh, but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone.
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know,
I love her, yes I love her just enough to let her go.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.
