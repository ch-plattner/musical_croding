People get ready, there's a train a-coming.
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board.
All you need is faith to hear those diesels humming.
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord.

People get ready for the train to Jordan,
picking up passengers from coast-to-coast.
Faith is key, open up the doors and board them.
There's hope for all among the loved the most.

But there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
who would hurt all mankind to save his own.
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner.
There's no hiding place from the kingdom's throne.

People get ready, there's a train a-coming.
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board.
All you need is faith to hear those diesels humming.
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord, thank the Lord.
