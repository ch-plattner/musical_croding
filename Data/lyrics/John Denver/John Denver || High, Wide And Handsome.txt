
Down from the great white north, more than enough and then some.
Swept her up on his horse, Tumbleweeds, we're meant to get stuck up on a fence.
Heaven must have sent you, you've got no wire to roll against.
Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins.
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains.

Worlds out there are waiting, big and wild as the sky.
No more hesitating, it's now or never, do or die.

Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins.
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains.

As hard as you imagined it being without me, we'll both be wishing it were that easy.
Don't give me a pull, give me some room, when this round is through, I'll be coming back home.
Wide open spaces between these two prairie hearts,
wondering where their place is in a world so far apart.
Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins.
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains.
