Give us a brand new morning, show us forever beginning to stand on our own.
African sunrise, smile on my African home.

In this hour of quiet contemplation, the stillness of the dawning calms my mind.
I face the day with heartfelt exaltation, the light is both a promise and a sign.
In the darkness, we have lost the son of our sister, though the beauty of his spirit lingers still.
This was a child of love, a child of laughter, who cannot understand the way I feel.

Is it not the sun that gives the seasons? Is it not the sun that brings the rain?
Our throats are choked with dust, but we're still singing.
Our song will not be silenced by the pain.

All around the village I could hear the roosters crowing.
There was a time it was like music to my ears.
Now all I can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying.
I pray for rain to wash away their tears.

African sunrise, light of a brand new day. African sunrise, light of a brand new way.
With one who will be our brother, and one who will be our partner and teach us to know.
African sunrise, smile on my African home.
African sunrise, smile on my African home. African sunrise.
