
In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

Karen she's a silver sun, you best walk her way and watch it shine,
watch her watch the morning come.
A silver tear's appearing now, I'm crying, ain't I? I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

There ain't no doubt it no one's mind that loves the finest thing around,
whisper something soft and kind.
And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I? I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

Dark and silent late last night, I think I might have heard the highway call.
Geese in flight and dogs that bite.
Signs that might be omens say I'm going. I'm going, I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

With a holy host of others standing round me, still I'm on the dark side of the moon.
and it seems like it goes on like this forever, you must forgive me if it's up and

In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind,
in my mind I'm going to Carolina.
Can't you see the sunshine, can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind.
