
Raven's child is chasing salvation, black beak turned white from the crack and the snow.
On the streets of despair the answer is simple, a spoonful of mercy can set free the soul.
The drug king sits on his arrogant throne, away and above and apart.
Even children are twisted to serve him and greed has corrupted what once was a heart.

Raven's child keeps vigil for freedom, trades for the arms that once made her strong.
With nuclear warheads and lasers in heaven, fear does the choosing between right and wrong.
The arms king sits on his arrogant throne, away and above and apart.
Bankers assure him that he needn't care and greed makes a stone of what once was a heart.

Raven's child is washing the water, all of her wing-feathers blackened with tar.
Prince William shoreline's an unwanted highway of asphalt and anger an elegant scar.
The oil king sits on his arrogant throne, away and above and apart.
Lawyers have warned him he mustn't speak and greed has made silent what once was a heart.
You know there are walls that come tumbling down for people who yearn to be free.
Still there are hearts that long to be opened and eyes that are longing to see.

Raven's child is our constant companion, sticks like a shadow to all that is done.
Try as we may we just can't escape him, the source of our sorrow and shame, we are one.
The true King sits on a heavenly throne, never away nor above nor apart.
With wisdom and mercy and constant compassion, he lives in the love that lives in our hearts.
