The sun is slowly fading in the western sky.
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end.
Sometimes it takes a lifetime, sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again.

There's a heavy smog between me and the mountains,
it's enough to make a grown man sit and cry.
It's enough to make you wonder,
it's enough to make the world roll up and die.

I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be,
the way the people work with their machines.
Serenity's a long time coming to me,
in fact, I don't believe that I know what it means.

In the east a shaded moon is hanging lazily,
I do believe I saw the old man smile.
I do believe I did, I do believe he's been laughing all the while.

I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be,
the way the people work with their machines.
Serenity's a long time coming to me,
in fact, I don't believe that I know what it means anymore.

The sun is slowly fading in the western sky.
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end.
Sometimes it takes a lifetime, sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again,
the sun again, the sun again.
