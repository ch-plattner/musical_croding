Living on free food tickets. Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
where the rain came through, what can we do? Mmm.
Tears from your baby sister, crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go, oh but you know she'll get by,
Because she's living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.

It's a good thing you don't have bus-fare, it would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground, walking to the town to find a job.
Trying to keep your hands warm, but the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
and it chills to the bone. Boy you better go home where it's warm.
And you can live in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.

Living on dreams ain't easy, but the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
and the chills stay away, you take them in stride, family pride.
You know, faith is your foundation, with a whole lot of love
and a warm conversation and many a prayer, making you strong where you belong.
Living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.
Living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.
