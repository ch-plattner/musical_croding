
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style. In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile,
and on every street corner you'll hear:
Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.

Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.
Soon it will be Christmas day.
