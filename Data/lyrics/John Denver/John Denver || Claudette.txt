She loves me better than I thought she would.
I'm on my way to her house and I'm all out of breath,
and when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death.
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette, never make me fret.
Claudette, well, she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met.
I got the best loving that I'll ever get, from Claudette, pretty little pet.

Claudette, oh Claudette, well, I'm a lucky man, my baby treats me right.
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight.
When the date is over and I'm at her front door
and when I kiss her goodnight I holler more, more, more!
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette, never make me fret.
Claudette, well, she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met.
I got the best loving that I'll ever get, from Claudette, pretty little pet.

Claudette, oh, oh, Claudette, when me and my baby have a date or three
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me.
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life
when my brand new baby is my brand new wife.
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette, never make me fret.
Claudette, well, she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met.
I got the best loving that I'll ever get, from Claudette, pretty little pet.
Claudette, oh, oh, Claudette, mm mm. Claudette, oh, oh, Claudette, mm mm. Claudette:
