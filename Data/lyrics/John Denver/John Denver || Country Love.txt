Nashville tears are lonely signs that point to broken hearts,
broken lives and families that love has split apart.
Children who miss Daddy, Mommy's on the run,
pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun.
Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong,
sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs.
For each and every melody of happiness denied,
you know that there's another one that shows the other side.
Country Love is kisses in the kitchen, country love is honest and it's true.
Country love is home with your family, country love's the way that I love you.

Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands,
someone who's been there before and always understands.
Nashville nights are lonely roads that we've all traveled on,
sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home.
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove.
When Nashville night's the question, the answer's country love.
Country Love is kisses in the kitchen, country love is honest and it's true.
Country love is home with your family, country love's the way that I love you.
Country Love is kisses in the kitchen, country love is honest and it's true.
Country love is home with your family, country love's the way that I love you.
