Outside the heavy rain had grounded all the planes, so I asked her if she'd like some company.
In my rhinestone studded suit, my cowboy hat and boots, I must have been a sight for her to see.
But she said, "Pull up a chair" as she fumbled with her hair, a more unlikely pair you'll never see.
I was Mogen Davis wine, she was Chablis '59, but there we sat, the cowboy and the lady.
She was evenings at the opera, and summers in Paree,
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee.
The cowboy and the lady, as different as could be,
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee.

And somewhere in between her Harvey's Bristol Cream
and the beer I drank and the easy company,
we somehow came together, for a night of stormy weather,
now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy, there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady.
