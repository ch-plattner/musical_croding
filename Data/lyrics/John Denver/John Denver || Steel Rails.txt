Steel rails, chasing sunshine around the bend,
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind.
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.

It's not the first time I find myself alone at dawn.
If I really had you once, I still have you when I'm gone.
Whistle blowing, blowing lonesome in my mind,
Calling me along that never-ending double line.

Steel rails, chasing sunshine around the bend,
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind.
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.

The sun is shining through the open boxcar door,
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before.
And I've lost count of the hours, days and time.
Just the rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind..

Steel rails, chasing sunshine around the bend,
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind.
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.
