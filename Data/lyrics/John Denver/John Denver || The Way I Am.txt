I love the ocean on a peaceful mornin'
I love the freedom of a single man
I love the woman who just drives me crazy
I just can't help it that's the way I am

I don't like war, I don't like politicians
Don't like the one who has an angry hand
I don't like guns, I don't like nuclear missiles
Don't like the one who doesn't give a damn

It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
We can make love

I love the Lord, I love the little people
I love the one who is a gentle man
I love the rivers in the Rocky Mountains
I just can't help it that's the way I am

I've been to Boston, I've been to China
I've been around the world and back again
I've got a hunger that just keeps me runnin'
I can't help it that's just the way I am

But it's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
We can make love
