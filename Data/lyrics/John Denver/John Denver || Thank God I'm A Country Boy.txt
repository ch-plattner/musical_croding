ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack.
It's early to rise, early in the sack thank God I'm a country boy.
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm,
raising me a family and working on the farm.
My days are all filled with an easy country charm, thank God I'm a country boy.
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle.
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle, thank God I'm a country boy.

When the work's all done and the sun's setting low,
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow.
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low, thank God I'm a country boy.
I'd play Sally Gooding all day if I could,
but the lord and my wife wouldn't take it very  good.
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should, thank God I'm a country boy.
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.

I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels,
I never was one of them money hungry fools.
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools, thank God I'm a country boy.
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine,
a lotta sad people thinking that's-a mighty keen.
Son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean, thank God I'm a country boy.
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died,
and he took me by the hand and held me close to his  side.
He said, "Live a good life and play my fiddle with pride,
and thank God you're a country boy.
My Daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle,
he taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle.
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little,
thank God I'm a country boy.
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle.
