
Here I am, closing my eyes again, trying so hard not to see all the things that I see.
Almost willing to lie again, I swear that it just isn't so, it just isn't me.
We are never alone even though we'd like to be.
Then I go and open my eyes again.
Love in your eyes is the thing that I'd most like to see.
I'd be willing to die again, to know of a place and a time where it always could be,
to be always with you, and you always with me.

This is my autograph, here in the songs that I sing.
Here in my cry and my laugh, here in the love that I bring
to be always with you and you always with me.

Say a prayer and open your heart again.
You are the love and the light that we all need to see.
Always willing to shine and then.
Peace on this earth is the way that it always can be,
to be always with you and you always with me.

This is my autograph, here in the songs that I sing.
Here in my cry and my laugh, here in the love that I bring
to be always with you and you always with me.
