The days are like an oven, the nights forever. Nothing to do, not much else to see.
Then again, I can't stand the thought of winter, ain't got a fire, there's nobody to keep me warm.
The night is gray, and my coffee tastes so bitter, my memories go raging like a storm.

Seems like twenty years ago it was springtime, the rain was sweet, the wind was cool and clean.
I had a girl, she was a lady I could talk to, now its almost like she'd never been.
I've been a long time looking for rainbows, trying to find a way to believe in tomorrow.

There was a time I think when I remember dreaming, there was a reason I can't find it now.
As I recall, it almost made my life worth living. It must be hiding like the sun behind the clouds.
