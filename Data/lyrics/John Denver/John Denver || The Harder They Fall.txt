Upset because her baby just ain't treating her right, so afraid of being alone.
Said she's heard some stories, he's been running around. Said somehow she knows it's all true.
She said a breaking heart can make a terrible sound, she said she just don't know what to do.

Think about a bad time, can't get much worse. Think about a hard line, take it to the wall.
This won't be the last time, sure ain't the first. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

You might say she's caught between a rock and a hard place. You might think she just can't win.  Some just can't recover from a slap in the face, some just get right up and start all over again.

Think about a bad time, can't get much worse. Think about a hard line, take it to the wall.
This won't be the last time, sure ain't the first. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

Nobody wants to be all alone. Nobody wants to be all alone.
She's so afraid of being alone. We're so afraid of being alone.
