There are dreams that sail away to sea, dreams that stay at home.
There are dreams in need of company, and some that stand alone.
There are dreams that stay inside all day and never see the light,
and if dreams come true, I swear to you I'll dream of you tonight.

In a corner bar the local star destroys a passing chord.
His sits behind a mason jar and dreams of his reward.
Then he takes his break, he counts his take, a dollar buys a beer.
A quarter of his life is gone, what's he doing here?
Now times are hard, the old backyard is covered in cement.
The people seem afraid to dream and dreams don't cost a cent.

There are dreams that stay inside all day and never see the light,
and if dreams come true, I swear to you I'll dream of you tonight.
And if dreams come true, I swear to you I'll dream of you tonight.
