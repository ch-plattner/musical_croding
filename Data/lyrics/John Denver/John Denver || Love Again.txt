
I didn't think it could happen again, just too old and set in my ways.
I was convinced I would always be lonely all of the rest of my days.
Maybe I gave up on romance in my longing to give up the pain,
I just didn't believe I would ever love again.

I was like one who had shut myself in, closed the windows, locked all the doors.
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart, yet knowing there had to be more.
Though it sounds like a great contradiction, it's the easiest thing to explain,
you see, I was afraid I might never love again.

What does it take for a blind man to see that there's more there than just meets the eye?
What are the ways that the magic comes in that can turn a song into a sigh?
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming or maybe I'm going insane,
or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again.
Here I am standing beside you, oh, life's such a wonderful game.
Look at me now, I'm falling in love, look at me now, I'm falling in love,
look at me now, I'm falling in love again.
