I like to deal with the ladies, I like to give 'em a real hard time.
Like to make 'em sigh, like to make 'em cry over me.
I like to swing with the good times. I like to have me a real live ball.
Doing what I can like a dirty old man, tee hee.

Like to have 'em just hanging around, wondering where I've been.
Like to see 'em with their big brown eyes, just a drinking me in.
I like to deal with the ladies, I like to hang 'em up on my line.
Treat 'em kinda rough, but they never get enough of me, rat tat tat tat tat.
