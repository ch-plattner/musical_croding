
You've long been on the open road and sleeping in the rain,
from dirty words and muddy cells, your clothes are soiled and stained.
But the dirty words and muddy cells will soon be judged insane.
So only stop and rest yourself, and you'll be off again.
Oh, take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile.
Your feet are hot and weary from the dusty miles.
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try.
Just looking for the evening and the morning in your eyes.

Then tell me of the ones you saw as far as you could see,
across the plains from field to town, marching to be free.
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by debris,
like laughing children, one by one, they look like you and me.
Oh, take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile.
Your feet are hot and weary from the dusty miles.
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try.
Just looking for the evening and the morning in your eyes.

I know you are no stranger, now, to crooked rainbow trails,
from dancing cliffheads to shattered sills to slander shackled jails.
Where the voices drift up from below, his walls are being scaled.
Yes all of this, and more my friend, your song shall not be failed.
Oh, take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile.
Your feet are hot and weary from the dusty miles.
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try.
Just looking for the evening and the morning in your eyes.
Take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile.
Your feet are hot and weary from the dusty miles.
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try.
Just looking for the evening and the morning in your eyes.
