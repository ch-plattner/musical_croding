
Not so long ago, I packed my bags a hundred times.
Didn't seem to know how to stop or to unwind.
Going nowhere, a man without a dream. Guess my lucky star feel the day you came along.
To my lonely heart you are like a special song, singing sweetly your tender melody.
Thanks to you, the child inside me lives again. Thanks to you, I have found a peace within.
I know where I'm going and what I want to do, thanks to you.

Lying in your arms I found my greatest pleasure, I look into your eyes and dream about forever. Waking up with you and looking forward to the day,
what we plan to do, knowing anything at all's okay,
a life has a meaning, love has got a name.
Thanks to you, the child inside me lives again. Thanks to you, I have found a peace within.
I know where I'm going and what I want to do, thanks to you.
Thanks to you, the child inside me lives again. Thanks to you, I have found a peace within.
I know where I'm going and what I want to do, thanks to you.
