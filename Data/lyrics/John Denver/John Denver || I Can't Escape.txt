Funny thing about this little heart of mine, all the ways that it can say (I love you).
Longer than forever, till the end of time, no matter baby come what may (I love you).
Look at me now, sitting all by myself, face another sleepless night all alone.
All I look forward to is lying here living this song.
I can't escape thinking every day about you, can't escape wishing, dear, you were still mine.
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you, can't escape caring for you all of the time.

Listen to the music on the radio, top forty hits of yesterday (I love you).
'Leaving on a Jet Plane,' 'Blowin' in the Wind,' 'The Silly Games that People Play' (I love you),
each of them carries your memory still, I can still see that look in your eyes.
That one that preceded your kisses and followed your sighs.
I can't escape thinking every day about you, can't escape wishing, dear, you were still mine.
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you, can't escape caring for you all of the time.

Every rain in the morning reminds me of you, every night when it's cold outside,
every time that I ache inside.

Sometimes I wish it was ten years ago, we were starting all over again.
Yet the way that I feel is much more than just remembering when.
I can't escape thinking every day about you, can't escape wishing, dear, you were still mine.
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you, can't escape caring for you all of the time.
All of the time. All of the time.
