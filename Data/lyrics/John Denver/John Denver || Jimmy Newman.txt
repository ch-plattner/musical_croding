Get up Jimmy Newman, there's work to be done, and why do you lie there still sleeping?
There's a waiting line forming to use the latrine, and the sun is just opening the skies.
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen, and you've only to open your eyes.

Get up Jimmy Newman, the radio's on, the news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh.
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone, and why do you lie there still sleeping?
The night nurse is gone and the sexy one's here, and she tells us such beautiful lies.
Her uniform's tight, on her marvelous rear, and you've only to open your eyes.

Get up Jimmy Newman, you're missing the fun. They're talking us next, Jim it's time to go home.
It's over for us, there's no more to be done, and why do you lie there still sleeping?
It's state side for us, Jim, the folks may not know, and we'll let it be such a surprise.
They're loading us next, Jim we're ready to go, and you've only to open your eyes.

Get up, Jimmy Newman, they won't take my word. I said you sleep hard, but they're shaking their heads.
Get up, Jimmy Newman, and show them you heard. O Jimmy, just show them you're sleeping.
A joke is a joke, but theres nothing to gain. Jim I'd slap you but I'm too weak to rise.
Get up, dammit Jimmy, you're missing the plane, and you've only to open your eyes.
And you've only to open your eyes. Oh my God, Jimmy, open your eyes!
