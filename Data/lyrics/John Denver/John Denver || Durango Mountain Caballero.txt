
You know I love the trail I'm on
And the friends who ride with me
The country that we're passing through
Is a paradise to see, a haven for my spirit
The homeland of my dreams
My heart flies through the wilderness
And on an eagle's wings
And oh I love the waterfall
And the way the river sings
From snow-capped peaks both proud and tall
Through forests deep and green
The highway of the mountains
The lifeblood of the land
I can hear my mother speak to me
And hold my father's hand

Durango Mountain caballero
Take me for a ride
On the backbone of this mighty land
The Continental Divide
To the place where earth and heaven
Meet the mountains and the sky
In the heart of Colorado, Rocky Mountain High

And oh I love the campfire
And the circle that I'm in
The stories and the laughter
They should never, ever end
Forever in my memory
Forever in my song
On a San Juan mountain trail ride
I'll carry you along
