Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
Just last year when I was only seven, now I'm almost eight as you can see.
You came home a quarter past eleven, fell down underneath our Christmas tree.

Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
Mamma smiled and looked outside the window. She told me, "Son, you better get upstairs."
Then you laughed and hollered "Merry Christmas." I turned around and saw my mamma's tears.

Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
Please daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
No, I don't wanna see my mamma cry.
