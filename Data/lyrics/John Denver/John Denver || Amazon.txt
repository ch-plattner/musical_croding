There is a river that runs from the mountains, that one river is all rivers, all rivers are that one. There is a tree that stands in the forest, that one tree is all forests, all trees are that one.
There is a flower that blooms in the desert, that one blossom is all flowers,
all flowers are that one.
It is the song of life, it is the flower of faith, it is the tree of temptation it is the river of no regret.

There is a child that cries in the ghetto, that one child is all children, all children are that one. There is a vision that shines in the darkness, that one vision is all of our dreams,
all of our dreams are that one.
It is a vision of heaven, it is a child of promise, it is the song of life, it is the river of no regret.

Let this be a voice for the mountains, let this be a voice for the river,
let this be a voice for the forest, let this be a voice for the flowers,
let this be a voice for the ocean, let this be a voice for the desert,
let this be a voice for the children, let this be a voice for the dreamers,
let this be a voice of no regret, no regret.
