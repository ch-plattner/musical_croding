
I came here from the city a thousand miles away.
I came just for a little while you know I never meant to stay.
I meant to take my pleasure, have a good time and be gone.
But I fell in love with a lady, now I sing a mountain song.
I listened to the music of the night wind in the pines.
I've seen the quiet splendor of a field of columbine.
I skied on crystal pathways to a mountain peak so tall,
and I walked the mighty summits with the one who made it all.

And I fell in love with a lady 'cause I've seen her at her best.
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths through her open wilderness.
And now I never can betray her, steal her riches and be gone,
'Cause when you fall in love with a lady, you gotta sing a mountain song.

Now people come from everywhere to see what they can find.
And some take lots of pictures, and some just take their time.
But they're some who take her beauty that can't be bought or sold
And they think of only money while destroying wealth untold.

But you fall in love with a lady when you've slept upon her breast,
and you've walked her wild and rugged paths through her open wilderness
And you never can betray her, steal her riches and be gone.
'Cause when you fall in love with a lady, you gotta sing a mountain song.
