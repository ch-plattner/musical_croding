(Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweeds)
See them tumbling down pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind drifitng along with a tumbling tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone that a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweeds
(I'm a roving cowboy riding all day long tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song)
Nights underneath the prairie moon I'll ride along and sing a tune
I'll keep rolling along deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweeds
(Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweeds)
