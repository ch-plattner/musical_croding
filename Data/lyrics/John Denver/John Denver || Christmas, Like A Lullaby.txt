
Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the waters, rain fall on the sand
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land

It's morning in Australia; In fact, it's Christmas day
And Colorado never seemed so very far away

Back where night has fallen and it's still Christmas Eve
And snow is in the mountains that I always hate to leave
Christmas bells are ringing there's presents 'neath the tree
I know that it's been said before and now I know it's true
That home is where the heart is and Christmas lives there too

And on this morning Peace on Earth is still your fervent prayer
And I can feel it being whispered softly everywhere
And guns are called to silence and anger called to still
And brotherhood and sisterhood surrounded by goodwill

Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the waters, rain fall on the sand
We celebrate a baby aborn from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
