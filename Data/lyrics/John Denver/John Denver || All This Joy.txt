
All this sorrow, all this promise, all this pain.
Such is life, such is being, such is spirit, such is love.
City of joy, city of sorrow, city of promise, city of pain.
Such is life, such is being, such is spirit, such is love.
World of joy, world of sorrow, world of promise, world of pain.
Such is life, such is being, such is spirit, such is love.
All this sorrow, all this promise, all this pain.
But such is life, such is being, such is spirit, such is love. Such is spirit, such is love.
