All of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.
All of her nights have gone sad and shady, She's getting ready to fly.
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

Life in the city can make you crazy for sounds of the sand and the sea.
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry for things that you can't even see.
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she,
there's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be.
She's looking for lovers and children playing, she's looking for signs of the spring.
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing, she listens for any old thing.
Fly away, fly away, fly away .

In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she,
there's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be.
All of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.
All of her nights have gone sad and shady, She's getting ready to fly.
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away.

Where are my days, where are my nights? Where is the Spring? I wanna fly, I wanna fly:
