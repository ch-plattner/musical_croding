
You know sometimes I can't sleep at night. I can't quiet my heart or my mind.
I toss and I turn, I ache and I burn, I get caught in the passing of time.
It's like too many miles, too many heartaches, too much that needs to be done.
Yes, and too many sidewalks, too many people, too many hours alone.
What's on your mind and what's on my mind is really quite the same.
I've been working so hard and I'm ready to play, I know just the right game.
What's on your mind is what's on my mind. That's the way it's gonna be.
I'm gonna find me a place I can hide, I want you right next to me.

Oh, I've never seen a more beautiful day, it's my favorite time of the year.
The colors are changing, she's rearranging and I'm so glad to be here.
I've been up and around, I've been lost, I've been found, I've seen love face to face in my dreams.
And the things that I know and the things that I show are not always just what they seem.
What's on your mind is what's on my mind, it's just that way.
It's like catching a ride on a beautiful river, let it carry us all away.
What's on your mind is what's on my mind is really nothing new.
I want to get you alone, I want to make you my own, baby, I want to make love with you.
What's on your mind is what's on my mind, is really quite the same.
I've been working so hard and I'm ready to play baby, I know just the right game.
What's on your mind is what's on my mind is really nothing new.
I want to get you alone, I want to make you my own, baby, I want to make love with you.
