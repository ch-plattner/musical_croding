
Played a wedding for the money, and I wish I could've told the bride and groom
just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.
I was rumbling through the verses 'bout how men and women ought to live apart,
how the promise never made cannot be broken and can never break a heart.

Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor,
her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.
As her joy fell on the honored guests, each one of them was drawn into her dream,
and they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her "dance little Jean!"

And they said dance little Jean, this day is for you.
Two people that you love stood up to say I do.
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had was answered today, your mom is marrying your dad.

Well, the cynic's heart just melted as I figure what this gift together meant
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusion that the little girl had spent.
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake,
but we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little Jeannie Sage.

We played dance little Jean, this day is for you. Two people that you love stood up to say I do.

And they said dance little Jean, this day is for you.
Two people that you love stood up to say I do.
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had was answered today, your mom is marrying your dad.

And they said dance little Jean, this day is for you.
Two people that you love stood up to say I do.
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had was answered today, your mom is marrying your dad.
