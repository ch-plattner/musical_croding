
I'd sing you a song without a word, still you would hear my tune.
I'd give you a day without a time so it won't end too soon.
Oh, anything, I would do, and that really is my point of view,
if ever, my darling, in my life, I ever had a chance to love you.

I'd build you a world made of the dream that dances in your head.
Take a rainbow with colors bright to hang over your bed.
Anything, I would do, and that really is my point of view,
if ever, my darling, in my life, I ever had a chance to love you.

Fate's been waiting for the right time to put us in each other's arms,
but why should we sit and waste time? To start right now would do no harm.

Oh, give me a sign and I will show you the magic of which I speak.
Open your heart, let me come in. My love is yours to keep.
Oh, anything, I would do, and that really is my point of view,
if ever, my darling, in my life, I ever had a chance to love you.
If I ever had a chance to love you. If I ever had a chance to love you.
If I ever had a chance to love you. If I ever had a chance to love you:.
