Don't want to live in New York City, man.
Don't want to live in Tokyo.
I want to stay in my own village, man.
Is nowhere else I need to go.
Is nothing that I want for myself.
That I don't want for everyone.
To work in peace to live in freedom.
To look and never see a gun.

Why are we calling this the third world?
I only know that it is my world.
Maybe someday it can be our world.
Can you imagine one world, one world.

My heart it hurts more than my belly.
So hard to live in poverty.
I want to work for my own living, man.
Don't want someone to care for me.
Don't want to speak of revolution.
It starts to sounding like a fight.
I give myself to evolution.
One world will make it be all right.

Why are we calling this the third world?
I only know that it is my world.
Maybe someday it can be our world.
Can you imagine one world, one world.

This world is made for everybody.
This life is gift for everyone.
This earth is bound to keep on turning.
This day is flowers in the sunshine, sunshine.

Why are we calling this the third world?
I only know that it is my world.
Maybe someday it can be our world.
Can you imagine one world, one world.
Why are we calling this the third world?
I only know that it is my world.
Maybe someday it can be our world.
Can you imagine one world, one world.
