
I'm bringing me home to you, that's all that I have to give,
my life, my love, my everything, it's you I choose to be with.

Had a wonderful time in the city, I smile when I recall.
The space, the songs, the company, I really had a ball.
It's a funny set of circumstances, sends me out on the road alone.
With the moon looking over my shoulder, I'm finding my way back home.
I'm bringing me home to you, that's all that I have to give.
My life, my love, my everything, it's you I choose to be with.

Riding high in the Rocky Mountains, they're quiet and peaceful times.
I'd swear the stars are smiling like they know what's on my mind.
You see, on any such an occasion, my thoughts will turn to you.
The time I spend all by myself I mostly spend with you.
I'm bringing me home to you, that's all that I have to give.
My life, my love, my everything, it's you I choose to be with.

When I lay down beside you, all the love that you show.
I wanna live my life with you, it's all the dreams that I know.
I'm bringing me home to you, that's all that I have to give.
My life, my love, my everything, it's you I choose to be with,
it's you I choose to be with, it's you I choose to be with, it's you I choose to be with.
