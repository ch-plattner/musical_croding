If I look like home to you, if I am your sign, don't try to understand it girl when I draw the line.
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

For the skies, they look so lazy now, heavy are the clouds.
There's nothing here that I can learn of what it's all about.
You haven't said a thing to me, you talk so very loud, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

Well, I think I'll try the circus or go back to Mexico.
It's time to make mistakes again, it's time to change the show.
It's time and time and time again to find another way,
It's time to gather forces and get out of yesterday.
Because I lost what I was looking for, there's nothing left to share.
I need to take myself away to be some other where,
a face, a life, a minute more, I don't think I can spare, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

'Cause I tell you when you hurt me and you just don't seem to know,
I inform you when I'm lonely and you still don't think I'll go.
So if I lie to you and smile a thought that's only halfway here,
it's just a circus and I'm singing, I'm never really near.
If I look like home to you, if I am your sign, don't try to understand it girl when I draw the line.
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time,
looking everywhere, looking everywhere, looking anywhere, going nowhere.
