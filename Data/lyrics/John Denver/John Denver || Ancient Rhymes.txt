
Two days before the moon was round, you felt the urge of sun's light beams.
The muffled world of dolphin sound slipped down and back into your dreams.
For nine full months that passed before, you learned of all life's ancient rhymes.
Then mother sensed a farther shore and brought you forth into these times,
so taste the air of your new world and gently guide us to your mind.
It knows the winds and sails unfurled and holds to heart the dolphin kind.

Welcome precious earth made child, we met you first in your father's songs
and mother's smile and waters wild, it's in this place you now belong.
I know you know of all these things and feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh
for you were born on silver wings to taste the high blown crystal sky.
So sing one day to all of us, the songs you learned in dolphin lair,
giving hope to life as all we must and teach us how their grace to share.
