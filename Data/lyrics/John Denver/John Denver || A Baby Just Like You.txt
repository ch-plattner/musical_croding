The sea son is upon us now, a time for gifts and giving.
And as the year draws to its close, I think about my living.
Christmas time when I was young, the magic and the wonder.
But colors dull and candles dim and dark my standing under.

Oh, little angel, shining light, you've set my soul to dreaming.
You've given back my joy in life, you filled me with new meaning.

A savior King was born that day, a baby just like you.
And as the Magi came with gifts, I come with my gift too.
That peace on earth fills up your time and brotherhood surrounds you,
That you may know the warmth of love and wrap it all around you.

It's just a wish, a dream I'm told from days when I was young,
Merry Christmas little Zachary, Merry Christmas everyone.
Merry Christmas little Zachary, Merry Christmas everyone.
