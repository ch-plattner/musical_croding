I remember you, you're the one that made my dreams come true
just a few kisses ago, I remember you.
You're the one who said I love you too, yes I do.
Didn't you know I remember too, a distant bell and stars that fell, like the rain out of the blue.
When my life is through and the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all
then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember, tell them I remember you.

I remember too, a distant bell and stars that fell, like the rain out of the blue.
When my life is through and the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all
then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember, tell them I remember you.
