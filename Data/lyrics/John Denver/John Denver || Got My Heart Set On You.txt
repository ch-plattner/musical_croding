
Ever since the day I met you, I feel like I'm walking on air.
And lately I'm convinced, it's no coincidence I run into you everywhere.
And though I've heard your love is taken, I gotta believe what's in your eyes.
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time and we get together one of these nights.
Got my heart set on you, you're everything that I ever wanted.
Got my heart set on you, it can't be anything but love. Baby I'm betting on it.

I don't want to give you the wrong impression.
I'm not the kind who rushes in, but baby every time I see you,
before I even leave you I can hardly wait to see you again.
I got my heart set on you, you're everything that I ever wanted.
Got my heart set on you, it can't be anything but love. Baby I'm betting on it.

I don't mean to be coming on strong or taking anything for granted,
but love is a thing that just comes along.
You don't understand how it got out of hand, but you're in it right from the start.
I got my heart set on you, you're everything that I ever wanted.
Got my heart set on you, it can't be anything but love. Baby, I'm betting on it.
