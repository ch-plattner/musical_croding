There's lonely hearts in Arkansas, there's truckers in Des Moines
all there to keep me company in the early morn.
A world unknown to daytime is forever going on
the airways of the nation between midnight and the dawn.
Late nite radio, take it everywhere I go. My best friend when I'm lonely is my late nite radio.

Well I turn the dial, a little bit past one-o-one point two
in time to catch the news and see who's shooting who.
Then I hunt around for old songs, they're so good to hear again.
To think of how it was, imagine how it might have been.
Late nite radio, take it everywhere I go. My best friend when I'm lonely is my late nite radio.
La la la, I sing along 'cause I never know the words.
La la la la la la la la la, I'd love to call a talk show but I haven't got the nerve.
La la la, oh oh oh, radio.

The Lord is still my shepherd but these preachers got to go.
This time of night my interest lies in UFO's.
So I turn the dial a little past fifty-six point three to find myself a lullaby to rock me off to sleep.
Late nite radio, take it everywhere I go. My best friend when I'm lonely is my late nite radio.
Late nite radio, take it everywhere I go. My best friend when I'm lonely is my late nite radio.
