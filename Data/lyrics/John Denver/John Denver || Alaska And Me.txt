When I was a child and I lived in the city, I dreamed of Alaska so far away.
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glaciers,
somehow I knew that I'd live there one day.
Well it took me some growing, and a fair bit of schooling,
and a little bit of trouble to get on the move.
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner, when I came to Alaska the land that I love.
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people, here's to the wild and here's to the free.
Here's to my life in a chosen country, here's to Alaska and me.

I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna, raised in hard times but I had a good life.
From the first time I flew with my father a singing, I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.
We sleep near the sound of a slow running river and wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain.
And we face every day like the first or the last one with nothing to lose and Heaven to gain.
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people, here's to the wild and here's to the free.
Here's to my life in a chosen country, here's to Alaska and me, oh, here's to Alaska and me.
