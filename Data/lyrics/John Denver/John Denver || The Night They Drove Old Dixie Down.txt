The stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again.
In the summer of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive.
By May the 10th Richmond had fell, was a time I remember oh, so well.
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing.
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singing.
They went la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.

Back home in Tennessee my wife called out to me.
Said Virgil, come quick and see, there goes Robert E. Lee.
I don't mind chopping wood, and I don't care if the money ain't good.
You take what you need and save the rest, but they should never have taken the very best.
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing.
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singing.
They went la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.

Like my father before me, he was a working man.
Like my brother above me, he took a rebel stand.
Was just 18, proud and brave when a Yankee laid him in his grave.
I swear by the blood beneath my feet, you can't raise a Cain back up when he's in defeat.
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing.
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singing.
They went la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.

The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing.
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singing.
They went la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.
