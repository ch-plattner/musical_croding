Blue river, blue, I'd rather be outside. Here I am inside watching it rain.
Blue river, blue, I'd rather be somewhere. Here I am nowhere watching it rain.

(1,2,3,4!) Some people like that downhill stuff, they like it fast and breezy.
Some people walk on the other side, they like it slow and easy.
Some people run on a mountain trail, some like it wild and rough.
Some like to fly, some like to sail, some like the downhill stuff.

There's work in what we practice, work in the things we save.
Sometimes we work just to try to make a living or we're working just to make it pay.
Sometimes we're trying to work our will, that won't work anyway.
I only know that I'm working still just to get another chance to play.
Some people like that downhill stuff, they like it fast and breezy.
Some people walk on the other side, they like it slow and easy.
Some people run on a mountain trail, some like it wild and rough.
Some like to fly, some like to sail, some like the downhill stuff.

Keep moving in a forward direction like a river rolling down to the sea.
If you wanna make a different selection, honey, let yourself go with gravity.

Everybody's looking for heaven, everybody's looking for home.
Everybody's looking for higher and higher but nobody wants to be looking alone.
Everybody's trying to get down to it, everybody's trying to sing.
Whatever it is, we're all gonna do it but whatever we do, we gotta do our own thing.

Some people like that downhill stuff, they like it fast and breezy.
Some people walk on the other side, they like it slow and easy.
Some people run on a mountain trail, some like it wild and rough.
Some like to fly, some like to sail, some like the downhill stuff.

I like the downhill stuff. Let me slide down that downhill stuff.
Oh, honey give me some downhill stuff .
