
Time as I've known it doesn't take much time to pass by me.
Minutes into days, turn into months turn into years, they hurry by me.
Still I love to see the sun go down and the world go around.

Dreams full of promises, hopes for the future I've had many.
Dreams I can't remember now, hopes that I've forgotten, faded memories.
Still I love to see the sun go down and the world go around.

And I love to see the morning as it steals across the sky,
I love to remember and I love to wonder why,
and I hope that I'm around so I can be there when I die, when I'm gone.

I hope that you will think of me in moments when you're happy and you're smiling.
that the thought will comfort you  on cold and cloudy days if you are crying.
And that you'll love to see the sun go down and the world go around and around and around.
