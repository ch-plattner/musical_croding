As I travel down the road and search the empty sky,
waiting for the moment when my eyes will see.
Many are the memories, the mysteries of time,
how they dance around and whisper endlessly.
Yes, I've traveled down this road before where so many men have come and gone.
But you know it takes time (true love takes time).
You know that true love takes time (true love takes time).
And it's so very hard to find (true love takes time). You know that love takes time.

It seemed impossible that I could care again, so it seemed I had forgotten how to give.
What is this miracle that brings me back my dreams?
All at once I can remember how to live.
Yes, I've traveled down this road before where so many men have come and gone.
But you know it takes time (true love takes time).
You know that true love takes time (true love takes time).
And it's so very hard to find (true love takes time).
You know that true love takes time.

I have been too much alone for oh, so many years, looking for someone to sing with me.
Sweet harmony, my heart is open now and tender to the touch.
But there is love enough to heal me in your hands,
I'll give you all my nights, all my sun and rainy days.
I'll give you all the time it takes to understand we've all traveled down this road before.
Where so many fools have come and gone.
But you know it takes time (true love takes time).
You know that true love takes time (true love takes time).
And it's so very hard to find (true love takes time).
You know that true love takes time. True love takes time.
True love takes time. True love takes time.
