we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

We want some figgy pudding, we want some figgy pudding,
we want some figgy pudding, please bring it right here.

We won't go until we get some, we won't go until we get some,
we won't go until we get some (Animal, sit!), so bring it out here.

We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas,
we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
