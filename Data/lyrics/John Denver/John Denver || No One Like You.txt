
I like your eyes.
I like your nose.
I like your mouth.
Your ears, your hands, your toes.

I like you face.
It's really you.
I like the things you say and do.
There's not a single soul
Who sees the skies
The way you see them.
Through your eyes.
And aren't you glad.
You should be glad.
There's no one, no one
Exactly like you.
