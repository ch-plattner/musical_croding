
You can do whatever you want to do, wherever you want to go, it's up to you.
And wouldn't it be fine following your heart, playing your own part.
You and me out on the farm, let the sun be our alarm.
Kicking off our shoes, doing what we choose.
And wouldn't it be fine knowing that you're mine anytime you want to be.

But I don't want to own you, I just want to hold you.
I don't want to need you, I just like to see you smile and stay for a while.

And if the times get rough being free might be enough
to keep our feelings warm, see us through the storm.
And wouldn't it be fine looking back and knowing that we helped each other find.
You can do whatever you want to do wherever you want to go, it's up to you.
And wouldn't it be fine following your heart,
Knowing from the start it's up to you, it's up to you, it's up to you.
