
Yes, I been dreaming about you every day, each and every day.
And I been thinking about all night long, I even wrote a song.
Just to try and tell you how I really feel, to make you understand my love is real,
that you're on my mind all the time, I wish to God you were mine once again.

I remember talking to you, I remember walking with you,
I remember laughing all the time when you were mine.
Now the days seem so long, I can't face the night alone,
I beg you please, won't you please come home.

I remember talking to you, I remember walking with you,
I remember laughing all the time when you were mine.
Now the days seem so long, I can't face the night alone,
I beg you please, won't you please come home.
