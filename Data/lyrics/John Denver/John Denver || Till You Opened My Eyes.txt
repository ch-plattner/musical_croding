
Down, down, down, deeper into love, all around I can feel your love.
All my life I've been dreaming night into morning, till you opened my eyes.
Love, love, love, such a mystery, golden lights shining down on me.
Soft and warm as the morning, but I never saw it, till you opened my eyes.

Floating in circles I'm flying, it feels so good that I'm crying.
Down, down, down, deep inside of me, love sweet love's all that I can see.
Golden light keeps on shining, shining forever since you opened my eyes.
