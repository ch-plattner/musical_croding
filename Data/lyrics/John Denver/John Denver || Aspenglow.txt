
See the sunlight through the pine, taste the warm of winter wine.
Dream of softly falling snow, winter skol, aspenglow.
As the winter days unfold, hearts grow warmer with the cold.
Peace of mind is all you know, winter skol, aspenglow.

Aspen is a life to live, see how much there is to give,
see how strongly you believe, see how much you may receive.

Smiling faces all around, laughter is the only sound,
memories that can't grow old, winter skol, aspenglow.

Aspen is a life to live, see how much there is to give,
see how strongly you believe, see how much you may receive.

See the sunlight through the pine, taste the warm of winter wine.
Dream of softly falling snow, winter skol, aspenglow.
As the winter days unfold, hearts grow warmer with the cold.
Peace of mind is all you know, winter skol, aspenglow. Winter skol, aspenglow.
