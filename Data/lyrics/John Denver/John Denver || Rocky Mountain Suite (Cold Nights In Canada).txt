
Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta, two men and four ponies on a long lonesome ride.
To see the high country and learn of her people,
the ways that they lived there, the ways that they died.
And one is a teacher and one a beginner just wanting to be there and wanting to know.
And together they're trying to us a story that should have been listened to long, long ago.

How the life in the mountains is living in danger from too many people, too many machines.
And the time is upon us, today is forever, tomorrow is just one of yesterday's dreams.
Cold nights in Canada and icy blue winds, the man and the mountains are brothers again.
Clear waters are laughing, they sing to the skies. The Rockies are living, they never will die.
