
Father, oh, father please hear me, my song is a cry of desperation.
All of the words I hear have lost their meaning.
My life is a well of confusion drowned out by the sound of the lost and lonely.
Only the voice inside speaks your name to me.
If they only knew the things that I know, If they only could see the things that I see.
If they only knew the things that I know, If they only could see the things that I see.

My brothers at opposite tables, like fire and water against each other.
Only a fool can't see the obvious ending.
Are we as ashes to wildwood? Is life just a fire that can only consume us?
Is there no vision of love to bind us together?
If they only knew the things that I know, If they only could see the things that I see.
If they only knew the things that I know, If they only could see the things that I see.
