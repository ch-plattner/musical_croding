
Thank you for this precious day, these gifts you give to me.
My heart's so full of love for you, sings praise for all I see.
Oh, sing for every mother's love, for every childhood tear.
Oh, sing for all the stars above, the peace beyond all fear.

This is for the refugees, the ones without a home. A boat out on the ocean, a city street alone.
Are they not some dear mother's child? Are they not you and I?
Are we the ones to bear this shame and they this sacrifice?
Or are they just like falling leaves who give themselves away?
From dust to dust, from seed to shear and to another day.
If I could have one wish on Earth of all I can conceive,
would be to see another Spring and bless the falling leaves.

Thank you for this precious day, these gifts you give to me.
My heart's so full of love for you, sings praise for all I see.
Oh, sing for every mother's love, for every childhood tear.
Oh, sing for all the stars above, the peace beyond all fear.
