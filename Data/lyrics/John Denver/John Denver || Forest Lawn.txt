
Oh, lay me down in Forest Lawn in a silver casket
with golden flowers over my head in a silver basket.
Let the drum and bugle corp play taps while cannons roar.
While sixteen liveried employees sell souvenirs from the funeral store.
I wanna go simply when I go. They'll give me a simple funeral there, I know.
With a casket lined in fleece and the fireworks spelling out "Rest in Peace,"
Oh, take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh, lay me down in Forest Lawn, they understand there.
They have a heavenly choir in the military band there.
Just put me in their care, I'll find my comfort there.
With sixteen planes in a last salute, they'll drop a cross in a parachute.
I wanna go simply when I go, they'll give me a simple funeral there I know
With a hundred strolling strings and topless dancers with golden wings,
Oh, take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh, come, come, come, come, come to the church in the wild wood,
Kindly leave a contribution in the pail.
Be as simple and as trusting as a child would and we'll sell you the church in the dale.

To find a simple resting place is my desire.
To lay me down with a smiling face comes a little bit higher.
My likeness cast in brass will stand in plastic grass
While hidden weights and springs tips it's hat to the mourners filing past.

I wanna go simply when I go. They'll give me a simple funeral there I know.
I'll lie beneath the sand with piped-in tapes of Billy Graham,
oh, take me when I'm gone to forest lawn.

Rock of ages cleft for me for a slightly higher fee. Oh, take me when I'm gone to forest lawn.
