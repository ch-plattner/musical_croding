I've seen pictures of flowers, and I'd love to have smelled one.
Whose river was this? You say it ran freely. Blue was it's color.
I've seen blue in some pictures, and I'd love to have been there.

Tell me again I need to know. The forest had trees, the meadows were green.
The oceans were blue and birds really flew. Can you swear that it's true?

Whose gray sky was this? Or was it a blue one? You say there were breezes.
I've heard records of breezes and I'd love to have felt one.

Tell me again I need to know. The forest had trees, the meadows were green.
The oceans were blue and birds really flew. Can you swear that it's true?

Whose garden was this? It must have been lovely. Did it have flowers?
I've seen pictures of flowers, and I'd love to have smelled one.
Tell me again I need to know, tell me again I need to know.
Tell me again I need to know, tell me again I need to know.
