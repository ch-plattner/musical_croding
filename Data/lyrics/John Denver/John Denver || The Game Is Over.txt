
Time, there was a time, you could talk to me without speaking.
You would look at me and I'd know all there was to know.
Days I think of you and remember the lies we told in the night.
The love we knew, the things we shared when our hearts were beating together.

Days that were so few full of love and you.
Gone, the days are gone now, days that seem so wrong now.
Life won't be the same without you to hold again in my arms to ease the pain.
And remember when our love was a reason for living.

Days that were so few full of love and you. The game is over.
