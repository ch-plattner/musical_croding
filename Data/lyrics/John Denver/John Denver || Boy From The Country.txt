they drove him out into the rain.
Some people even said that the boy from the country was insane.

Because he spoke to the fish in the creek. He tried to tell us that the animals could speak.
Who knows? Perhaps they do.
How do you know they don't just because they've never spoken to you?

Boy from the country left his home when he was young, boy from the country, he loves the sun.

He tried to tell us that we should love the land.
We just turned our heads and laughed. You see we did not understand.
Sometimes I think the boy from the country is the only one who sees,
'cause the boy from the country doesn't want to see the forest for the trees.

Boy from the country left his home when he was young, boy from the country, he loves the sun.
