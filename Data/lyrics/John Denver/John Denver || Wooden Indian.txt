
I was a red man, I was proud, I was strong.
You were the white man and you stole away my home.
Now I am a wooden Indian, painted dreams inside my head.
Times the way you bring me down make me wish that I was dead.
Na na na na na na, na na na na na. Na na na na na na, na na na na na.

I was a red man, in my passing made no sound.
You were the white man and you drove me in the ground.
Now I am a wooden Indian standing silent in the rain.
I swear by my grandfather's father, we're gonna rise again.
Na na na na na na, na na na na na. Na na na na na na, na na na na na.

I was a red man, I was proud, I was strong.
You were the white man and you stole away my home.
Now I am a wooden Indian standing silent in the rain.
I swear by my grandfather's father, we're gonna rise again.
