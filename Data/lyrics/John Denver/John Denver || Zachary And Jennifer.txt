He'll bathe in crystal fountains, shining laughter in the sun.
We want to call her Jennifer. She'll dance in field of flowers.
She'll sing in summer showers, blending music to the time.
Oh, we want to live forever.  In this mirror see tomorrow.
All the joy and all the sorrow we can only hope to share.
