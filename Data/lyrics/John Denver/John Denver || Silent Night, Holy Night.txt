
Silent night, holy night. All is calm, all is bright.
Proud young virgin mother and child. Holy infant so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night. Shepherds wake at the sight.
Glorious dreams from heaven above. Heavenly hosts sing "Hallelujah."
"Christ the savior is born, Christ the savior is born."

Silent night, holy night. Son of God, love's pure light.
Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of breathing in grace.
Jesus Lord of thy herd, Jesus Lord of thy herd.

Hmmmm, hmmmm. Hmmmm, hmmmm.
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.
