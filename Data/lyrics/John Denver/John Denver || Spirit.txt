
His spirit joined as so was formed ten thousand years ago.
Between the swan and Hercules where even dark clouds glow.
To live with grace, to ride the swell, to yet be strong of will.
To love the wind, to learn its song, an empty space to fill.
Apollo taught me to rhyme, Orpheus taught me to play.
Andromeda cast down her sign and Vega lights my way.

Smoke rings in a galaxy, an endless flight through time.
Lyra gave her harp to him and left him free to climb.
A winter's journey from the moon to reach the summer sun.
To rise again, to sing for you a song that's yet unsung.
Apollo taught me to rhyme, Orpheus taught me to play.
Andromeda cast down her sign and Vega lights my way.

His spirit joined as so was formed ten thousand years ago.
Between the swan and Hercules where even dark clouds glow.
To live with grace, to ride the swell, to yet be strong of will.
To love the wind, to learn its song, an empty space to fill.
