
Islands call out to me like the highlands that I always see in my dreams of home,
I am never alone when I'm there.
Islands, like so many dreams, are like canyons, but off the main stream.
And there's no one there, the dreamer is always alone.
And the mighty blue ocean keeps rolling on every shore, like the spirit that binds us together,
we are so much more than islands.

Islands belong to the sea like the dark sands of my memory.
When the morning comes they are stepping-stones to the sun.
And the mighty blue ocean keeps rolling on every shore, like the spirit that binds us together,
we are so much more than islands, islands.
