
Oh, I love the changing seasons. Green and growing all around.
Smiling faces, laughing children, making such a joyful sound.
In my dreams, I see tomorrow, time and children of my own.
Someone who will stand beside me, helping me to make ourselves a home.
If your eyes can see tomorrow, though it might seem far away.
If you have some dreams to build on, may we help you today?
