
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
With every christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright.
And may all your Christmasses be white.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
With every christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright.
And may all your Christmasses be white.
