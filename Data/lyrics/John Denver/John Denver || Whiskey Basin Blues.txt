
On a snow covered night up in eastern Wyoming, another lazy day, looking for the sun.
In a drafty old cabin, outside of Whiskey Basin, another shining light and a good man on the run.
There's a lady back in Laramie and a reason no one else can see
for him to spend the winter on his own.
Nothing much to do tomorrow, just a matter of survival.
Another friendly fight in a life chock full of fun.

It's a special kind of medicine, all that you can do is win.
And though the taste is sweet, you can refuse.
Put your heart on the table, fill your cup with moonshine.
Another empty case of the Whiskey Basin Blues.
