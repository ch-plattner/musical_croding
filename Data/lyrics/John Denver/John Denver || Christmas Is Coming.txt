Scooter? Yes Ma'am. Gonzo? Check. Robin? Yes, Miss Piggy.
This is what we are going to sing.  Ahem,
Christmas is coming, the geese is getting fast (nice),
please to put a penny in the old man's hat.
If you haven't got a penny, a ha-penny will do,
if you haven't got a ha-penny than God bless you (good).

Now Scooter, you come in after my first line, and you two boys follow.
Christmas is coming, the geese is getting fast,
please to put a penny in the old man's hat.
If you haven't got a penny, a ha-penny will do,
if you haven't got a ha-penny than God bless you.

Christmas is coming, the geese is getting fast,
please to put a penny in the old man's hat.
If you haven't got a penny, a ha-penny will do,
if you haven't got a ha-penny than God bless you.
If you haven't got a ha-penny:uh Miss Piggy? We're finished.
Oh. I knew that.
