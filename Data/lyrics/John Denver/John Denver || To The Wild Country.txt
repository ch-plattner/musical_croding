
There are times I fear I lose myself, I don't know who I am,
I get caught up in the struggle and the strain.
With my back against a stone wall, my finger in the dam,
I'm losing strength and going down again.
When I take a look around me, my eyes can't find the sun, there's nothing wild as far as I can see.
Then my heart turns to Alaska and freedom on the run, I can hear her spirit calling me
to the mountains, I can rest there. To the rivers, I will be strong.
To the forests, I'll find peace there. To the wild country, where I belong.

Oh, I know sometimes I worry on worldly ways and means, and I can see the future killing me.
On a misbegotten highway of prophesies and dreams, a road to nowhere and eternity.
And I know it's just changes and mankind marching on, I know we can't live in yesterday.
But compared to what we're losing and what it means to me,
I'd give my life and throw the rest away
to the mountains, I can rest there. To the rivers, I will be strong.
To the forests, I'll find peace there. To the wild country, where I belong.
to the mountains, I can rest there. To the rivers, I will be strong.
To the forests, I'll find peace there. To the wild country, where I belong.
