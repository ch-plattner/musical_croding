
There's somethin' about the ocean rising up to meet the shoreline.
Somethin' about a river the way it runs to meet the sea.
There's somethin' about a rainfall and it's like the gift of living.
There's somethin' about the water that makes me sing.
Oh, somethin' about the mountains rising right straight up to heaven.
And somethin' about a canyon in the shade of a cottonwood tree.
Somethin' about the desert in the afterglow of evening.
There's somethin' about the west that makes me sing.

There's somethin' about the way you love me baby.
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine.
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me.
It really turns me on and makes my little light shine.
There's somethin' about the way you love me baby.
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine.
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me,
it really turns me on and makes this little light shine.

There's somethin' about the forest in the latter days of August.
There's somethin' about the country on the very first day of springtime.
There's somethin' about a wheatfield, oh you know I love the prairie.
There's somethin' about the land that makes me sing.
