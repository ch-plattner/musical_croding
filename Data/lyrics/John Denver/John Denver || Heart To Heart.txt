
I haven't seen all there is to see but I've seen quite a bit.
Some things I'll always remember, some things I wish that I could forget.
I haven't quite been around the world but I've been around the block.
I know that distances are meaningless like the hands that move around a clock.
And I know that love is everywhere, always safe, always true.
And exactly where it comes from is where it's going to.
Your heart to mine, my heart to yours. Talk about opening windows, talk about opening doors.
My heart to yours, your heart to mine, love is a light that shines from heart to heart.

Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong, the harbor and the lights,
they're like diamonds in the heavens, enough to brighten the darkest of nights.
There's another side to sorrow as there is to everything,
like the other side of lonely is falling in love again.
And then you'll know that there's an answer to the suffering we see,
and though it isn't easy, it's still as simple as you and me.
And you'll know that love is everywhere, always safe, always true.
And exactly where it comes from is where it's going to.
Your heart to mine, my heart to yours. Talk about opening windows, talk about opening doors.
My heart to yours, your heart to mine, love is a light that shines from heart to heart.
Your heart to mine, my heart to yours. Talk about opening windows, talk about opening doors.
My heart to yours, your heart to mine, love is a light that shines from heart to heart.
