Get at them boys, go back home, back to the girl you love.
Treat her right, never wrong, how mountain girls can love.
Riding at night in a high cold wind, on the trail of the old lonesome pine.
Thinking of you baby, feeling so blue, wondering why I left you behind.

Get at them boys, go back home, back to the girl you love.
Treat her right, never wrong, how mountain girls can love.
There's a lake in the hills where my true love goes,
that's when she's thinking of me.
Why I'm not there, heaven only knows,
heaven knows that's where I'd rather be.

Get at them boys, go back home, back to the girl you love.
Treat her right, never wrong, how mountain girls can love.

Get at them boys, go back home, back to the girl you love.
Treat her right, never wrong, how mountain girls can love.
