I remember romance, bubble baths at night.
Breakfast in the afternoon and love by candlelight, love by candlelight.
I remember romance and lying in her arms.
Her hair across my shoulder, her breast upon my arm, so soft upon my arm.
I remember romance and laughing at the moon,
dancing at the rainbow's end and losing her too soon, losing her too soon.
I know we both are sorry, I know we both still care.
Oh, how could we have lost It, a love beyond compare, a love beyond compare.
