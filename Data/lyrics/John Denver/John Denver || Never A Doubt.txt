There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind, we were meant to be lonely.
Never a doubt, I knew that I'd find you some day.
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights all alone, all those desperate mornings.
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind.

I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness,
not a window around.
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone.
Then again, each of us knows in a night of unbearable sadness, still a light can be found.
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come.
I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic, oh, the magic of love,
they think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain.
Then again, each of us knows when a heart has been broken, it's tragic, oh the magic of love.
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again.

All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing.
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear.
There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind, we were meant to be lonely.
Never a doubt, I knew that I'd find you some day.
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights all alone, all those desperate mornings.
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind.
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind.
