Make believe you're on a boat without water around.
Picture yourself at a circus without any clowns.
Pretend that you're on a highway without any end.
Then empty the ashtray, sweep up the floor, put a lock on your door.
If somebody calls in the morning, just say we don't live here no more.

Draw me a picture of an island without any seas.
Show me a map of the whole world without boundaries.
Build me a home without windows or doors to go in.
Then empty the ashtray, sweep up the floor, put a lock on your door.
If somebody calls in the morning, just say we don't live here no more.

Dream of the time when the tides ebbing now rise again.
Then you will know that to die is not really to end.
Living and dying are both your most intimate friends.
So empty the ashtray, sweep up the floor, put a lock on your door.
If somebody calls in the morning, just say we don't live here no more.
If somebody calls in the morning, just say we don't live here no more.
