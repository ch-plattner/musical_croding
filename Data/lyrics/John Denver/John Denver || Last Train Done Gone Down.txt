
That last train done gone down, that last train done gone down.
I heard the whistle moaning low, that last train done gone down.

My sweet baby's on that train, my sweet baby's on that train.
I wonder if I will see her again, that last train done gone down.

I heard that whistle moaning low, I heard that whistle moaning low.
I'm begging and pleading, please don't go. That last train done gone down.

I'm sorry for what I've done, I'm sorry for what I've done.
Too late, goodbye, my sweet baby cried. That last train done gone down.

That last train done gone down, that last train done gone down.
I heard the whistle moaning low, that last train done gone down.
