
I don't know why we still live together; we're so far a-part so much of the time.
I don't know why this beautiful weather is breaking my spirit
and tearing my mind all apart.
Are you so lonely? Are you so sad?
Have you lost your purpose, the faith that you had?
If life is a question, I don't understand, if time is the reason, then nobody can,
in my heart it is just an illusion, it's not even real,
it's much more than you think, it's much more than you feel.

My ears are still ringing, there's nothing to say. I look to the ocean to wash me away.
There goes my best friend, there goes my last dime.
If love is the answer, I'm wasting my time.
In my heart it is just an illusion, it's not even real,
it's much more than you think, it's much more than you feel.
Than you feel.  Is this real, what I feel, in my heart? In my heart? In my heart?
