
It's been almost a year since that beautiful weekend, it was more than a lifetime ago.
How it happens to mind after all of this time and brings tears to my eyes, I don't know.
It's the thought of you and the way that it hurts to be so much in love.
The thought of you brings it all my way

I know that it's late, I'm sorry I called. I'm surprised to have found you at home.
It's just once in a while I remember your number, I was hoping that you'd be alone.
For I thought of you and the way you can turn it around with a smile.
And the thought of you brings it all my way.
I know that it's over, but I can't discover a way to erase how I feel.
I remember the nights and the passionate fights and I know that I love you and I always will.

And I want you to know that I'm always here for you. Any day, any night, any time.
It happened before, it could happen once more,
there's a chance that you might change you're mind.
For the thought of you and the way that it feels to be safe in your arms,
the thought of you brings it all my way.

I know that it's over, but I can't discover a way to erase how I feel.
I remember the nights and the passionate fights and I know that I love you and I always will.
It's been almost a year since that beautiful weekend, it was more than a lifetime ago.
