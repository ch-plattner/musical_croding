The wheels go down, I'm back in town, three months full of summer and nothing to do.
It's been a strain at the reins but the picture remains,
southwind's blowing my love to you, southwind's blowing my love.

For sixty-one days I got caught in the maze, twenty thousand watching the songs go by.
The lights come down in an East Texas town,
southwind's blowing my love to you, southwind's blowing my love.

I couldn't wait until, till I got back home to you.
Or to get my fill of these California summer nights.

It's good to be home, my, how the children have grown.
Screen door's barking out that old familiar tune.
Games at the park, but honey, wait until dark,
southwind's blowing my love to you, southwind's blowing my love.

I couldn't wait until, till I got back home to you.
Or to get my fill of these California summer nights.

The wheels go down, I'm back in town, three months full of summer and nothing to do.
It's been a strain at the reins but the picture remains,
southwind's blowing my love to you, southwind's blowing my love.
southwind's blowing my love to you, southwind's blowing my love.
All my love, yeah, all of my love to you. All my love to you, yeah.
