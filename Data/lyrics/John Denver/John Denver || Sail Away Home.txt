You have so far to go, there's so much that you don't know.
Dream away, see what you find, yeah. Dream away, it's all in your mind.
Things that you'd like to see, things that you'd like to be.

Don't you know, it seems so wrong, yeah. Don't you know, it's gone on too long.
I can't take the guns anymore, I can't take the screams anymore, I can't take the pain.
It's got to stop, it's got to change, it can't go on, it can't go on.

Don't you know, it's gone on to long, yeah. Don't you know, it seems so wrong.
I can't take the guns anymore, I can't take the screams anymore, I can't take the pain.
It's got to stop, it's got to change, it can't go on, it can't go on.

Find a way, I know you can. Find a way, I'll give you my hand,
We're on our way back home, we've been a long time gone.
Sail away, sail away home. Sail away, sail away home. Sail away, sail away home.
