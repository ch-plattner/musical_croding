
See the sun rise, open up your eyes, today is the very first day.
Watch the morning come, now the night is gone, yesterday is so very far away.
Trouble, you get out of my sight, you know I can't look at you when the sun is so bright,
You know everything's coming together now, can't you see?
And I live my life in celebration that I've got a life to live,
and I sing my song in revelation that I've got a song that I can give to you, and you know I do.

La la la la la la la:

I was blind but, now I can see, you know, I'm just learning how it feels to be free,
you know I never really knew just what it could be before.
And I live my life in celebration that I've got a life to live,
and I sing my song in revelation that I've got a song that I can give to you,
and you know I do and you know it's true.

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
