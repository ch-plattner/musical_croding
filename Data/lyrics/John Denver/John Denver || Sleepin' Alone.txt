
For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough.
If things aren't what you're looking for, there's never quite enough.
And all the tea in China won't make a house a home,
you can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone.
Oh, there might be some one night stands to ease the pain inside,
or someone you can call around If you've lost all your pride.
Please don't be mistaken, I don't mean to put that down,
I know there's times when anything is better than sleepin' alone.
Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend.
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end.

You know that it's not company you are looking for,
You know it's not just pleasure, know it's something more.
You know it's not the answer if it's not like coming home,
It's the one who's there who doesn't really care that's worse than sleepin' alone.
Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend.
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end.
For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough.
If things aren't what you're looking for, there's never quite enough.
And all the tea in China won't make a house a home,
you can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone.
You might be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone.
