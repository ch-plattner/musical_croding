
Old train, I can hear your whistle blow and I want to be jumping on again.
Old train, I've been everywhere you go and I know what lies beyond each bend.
Old train, each time you pass you're older than the last,
and it seems, I'm too old for running.
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails,
they cry with every mile, and I think I'll stay awhile.

Old train, I grow weary at the miles and I miss the freedom that was mine.
Old train, just to think about those times, I'll smile when you're highballing by.
Old train, each time you pass you're older than the last,
and it seems, I'm too old for running.
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails,
they cry with every mile, and I think I'll stay awhile.
