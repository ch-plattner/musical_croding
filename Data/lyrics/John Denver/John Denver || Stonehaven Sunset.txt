
Stonehaven sunset, the water's on fire. My true love is singing, we kiss and conspire.
Sing a song for the ocean, a song for the sky, a song for tomorrow, love sweet by and by.
For the child who is coming and for dreams that come true,
sing a song for each other for me and for you.
Sing a song for all lovers, all the stars in the skies.
Sing of Stonehaven water home, Stonehaven sunrise.

Stonehaven sunset, the desert's on fire. Christ on the cross again burns with desire.
They are shooting at random, though they aim at us all,
It's the children who rise up and children who fall,
All the angels are weeping, the sweetest of tears fall like rivers of mercy to wash all our fears.
Sing a song for Old Glory and a future that dies,
sing of Stonehaven desert home, Stonehaven sunrise.

Stonehaven sunset, the city's on fire. The soldiers just smile and say this gun's for hire.
Give in to the beast, boy, give in to the thrill. It's just human nature to hunt and to kill.
We all die together, and yet somehow alone. Just together we have memories and many are gone.
Singing songs for old soldiers, a chorus of sighs,
sing of Stonehaven's city home, Stonehaven sunrise.

Stonehaven sunset, the mountain's on fire. My spirit is lifted, rising higher and higher.
All the prophets are laughing, they say we told you so,
it's one thing to play guessing games, another to know.
For the needs of many are the sins of a few, and the day is forthcoming when accounting is due.
Sing a song for sweet Justice with a fire in her eyes,
Sing of Stonehaven mountain home, Stonehaven sunrise.

Stonehaven sunset, the water's on fire. My true love is singing, we kiss and conspire.
Sing a song for the ocean, a song for the sky, a song for tomorrow, love sweet by and by.
For the child who is coming and for dreams that come true,
sing a song for each other, for me and for you.
Sing a song for all lovers, all the stars in the skies,
Sing of Stonehaven water home, Stonehaven sunrise.
