
Riding on a tradewind, filling my sails with a soft and southerly breeze,
living on the ocean of blue.
Dreaming of the islands, wrapping myself in a glow of the tropical moon,
I never shiver when the sun goes down.
All the earth she sings to me, every shallow, every tree, surely my love's shining like the sea.

I can make you happy. If I can I'll take you away on a wave in my arms.
Never leave you on the edge all alone.
If you feel like dancing, rolling like the water across my sleepless night,
making me a peaceful place.
All my life to be with you,  all I ever want to do, knowing you are felling that way too.

Distant thunder, heavy seas, Rocky Mountain memories, Surely I was lost till I found these.

Doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
