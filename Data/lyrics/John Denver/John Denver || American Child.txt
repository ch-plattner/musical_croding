Going up to Alaska, up to the land of the midnight sun,
where the whale and polar bear run over the icy blue sea.
Going up to Alaska, up to the north and the pioneer life,
where courage and strength still survive and a man can be free.

American child, does the call of the wild ever sing through the mist of your dreams?
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again?
When it's gone do you know what it means?

Can you picture the time when a man
had to find his own way through an unbroken land?
Before the machine changed the blue and the green
to something you can't understand?

American child there's a burning inside you that calls you away through the cold.
To come back again to all that you've been,
can't you see that it's time to come home?
To the flowers and the trees and the rivers and the seas
and the earth who's the mother of all?
A promise once made will it shine, will it fade, will we rise with the vision or fall?

Going up to Alaska, up to the land of the midnight sun,
where the whale and polar bear run over the icy blue sea.
Going up to Alaska, up to the north and the pioneer life
where courage and strength still survive and a man can be free, men can be free.

Going up to Alaska, going up to Alaska, going up to Alaska.
