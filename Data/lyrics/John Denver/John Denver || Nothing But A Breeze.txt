Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey, others figure tea's too strong.
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to stand in the middle,
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth.
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie and my head in the cool blue north.

In a small suburban garden, not a single neighbor knows our name.
I know the woman wishes we would move where the houses aren't all the same.
Say Johnny, I would like to go where the grass is greener, I couldn't really say where it may be.
But some place high on a mountain top, down by the deep blue sea.
And there, we'll do just as we please. It ain't nothing but a breeze.

One day I'll be old gray Grandpa, all the pretty girls will call me "Sir."
Now when they're asking me how things are, soon they'll ask me how things were.
Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa as long as you'll be my gray Grandma.
But I think we should move with our tea and cookies to the shade of the old pawpaw.

There we'll do just as we please, It ain't nothing but a cool breeze.
