
I guess growing isn't hard to do, just stand against the wall.
Once I was just two feet high, today I'm six feet tall.
But knowing who to listen to is something else again.
Words just whistle 'round my head like seasons in the wind.
All across the water, the clouds are sailing, they won't let me look at the sky.
All I want to do is try and find myself, come and let me look in your eyes.

In searching for the way to go, I've followed all the rules.
The way they say to choose between the wise men and the fools.
I listen to the words they say, I read what I should read.
I do whatever's right to do, try to be what I should be.
Someone let me in, I think the sky is falling, seems I've gotten lost on my way.
All I want to do is try and find myself, come and let me look in your eyes.

Oh, but wisdom isn't underground nor on a mountainside.
Where am I to take myself? There's no place here to hide, where can I hide?
All across the universe, the stars are fading. Seems we've gotten lost on our way.
All I want to do is try and find myself, come and let me look in your eyes.
Come and let me look in your eyes, come and let me look in your eyes.
