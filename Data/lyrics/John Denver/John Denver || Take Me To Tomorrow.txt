
Hey everybody, tell me how do you feel? Are you satisfied with your life, do you think it's real?
Tell me how is your head, what are your dreams?
Do you have any plans, do you have any schemes?
Do you care about, about anybody? I'd like to know, is the answer "no"?

Take me to tomorrow, take me there today, I've had my fill of sorrow and living this way.
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be, the day after tomorrow is waiting for me.

Hey everybody, what's on your mind?
Do you think there's nowhere else to go, there's nothing left to find?
Are you happy where you are, do you have anything to share?
Do you think you're gonna waste your life spending it there?
Would you like to find a way out, do you think it's worth a try?
I'd like to know, is the answer "no"? Well maybe so, come on,

Take me to tomorrow, take me there today, I've had my fill of sorrow and living this way.
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be, the day after tomorrow is waiting for me.
Take me to tomorrow, take me there today, I've had my fill of sorrow and living this way.
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be, the day after tomorrow is waiting,
the day after tomorrow is waiting, the day after tomorrow is waiting for me.
