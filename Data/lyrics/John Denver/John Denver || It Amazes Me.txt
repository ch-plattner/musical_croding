Seeking truth and understanding in the hope that he would find a way
to better serve his brothers and his sisters in the sun,
sharing all that he was given giving all to everyone.
Come and listen to the story of a journey once begun,
of a people and their plenty and their season in the sun and how they
gave themselves a symbol and things they could hold,
living lives in desperation, in the fear of letting go.

It amazes me and I know the wind will surely someday blow it all away.
It amazes me and I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way.

For our paths have come together now, where do we go from here?
Will our differences divide us, must we always live in fear?
For there are things that we must move through, some things to cast aside.
While our Father watches over us, our Mother will provide.

It amazes me and I know the wind will surely someday blow it all away.
It amazes me and I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way.
It amazes me, it amazes me, it amazes me.
