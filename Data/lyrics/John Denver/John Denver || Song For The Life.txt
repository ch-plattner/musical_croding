
I don't drink as much as I used to, lately it just ain't my style.
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to,
They pass quickly like when I was a child.
Somehow I've learned how to listen for a sound like the sun going down.
In the magic the morning is bringing, there's a song for the life I have found.
It keeps my feet on the ground.

Don't the midsummer days sit so heavy.
But don't they flow like a breeze through your mind.
And nothing occurs in a hurry to make up for someone's lost time.
Somehow I've learned how to listen for a sound like the sun going down.
In the magic the morning is bringing, there's a song for the friend I have found.
She keeps my feet on the ground.

Somehow I've learned how to listen for a sound like the breeze dying down.
In the magic the morning is bringing, there's a song for the life I have found.
It keeps my feet on the ground.  Ooh, yes, it keeps my feet on the ground.
