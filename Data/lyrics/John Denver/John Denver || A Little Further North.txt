
The sun sinks behind me in the west, this is the time of day I love best.
Salt breezes murmur through the coconut palm,
as the colors change, they set a scene of tropic calm.
Seagulls headed back to land, over the mangrove and the salt pan.
By a lazy creek with a six pack and a fishing line,
win back some memories and losing track of time.
I head a little further north each year. Leave the cities behind, out of sight out of mind.
Up where my troubles can all disappear I head a little further north each year.

Feeling the night wrap around me, eases my mind's serenity.
Ocean waves are humming on the outer reef,
these balmy days and sultry nights are a welcome relief.

I head a little further north each year, taking my mind to an easier time.
Up where there's silence and the night sky is clear, I head a little further north each year.
I head a little further north each year, taking my mind to an easier time.
Up where there's silence and the night sky is clear, I head a little further north each year.
