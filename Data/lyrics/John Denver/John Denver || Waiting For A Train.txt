
All around the water tower, waiting for a train.
A thousand miles away from home, sleeping in the rain.
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk,
He said if you've got money, I'll see that you don't walk.
Well, I haven't got a nickel, not a penny can I show.
Get off, get off, you railroad bum, and he slammed that boxcar door.

Well, he put me off in Texas, a state I dearly love.
The wide open spaces all round me, the moon and stars up above.
Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand.
I'm on my way from 'Frisco, going back to Dixieland.
My pocketbook is empty, my heart is full of pain.
I'm a thousand miles away from home, just waiting for a train.
