And I climbed all those Spanish steps, you've heard of them, no doubt.
But Rome has lost its glory, I don't know what it's about.
I wish you were here (when the shadows fall and all the rushing traffic stills).
I wish you were here (And the bells are ringing on the seven hills).

I make my way to a small cafÂ©, I wonder what you did today.
Wish you were here, dear one at home, I just flew in from Rome.
And Paris is a postcard, all decked out in color chrome.
And so I climbed the Eiffel Tower and prayed at Notre Dame,
but I just can't find the romance and I wonder why I came.
I wish you were here (On the Champs Elysees, lovers walking hand in hand).
I wish you were here (They take one look at me and seem to understand).

This city of light is a lovely sight, the first bright star I see tonight.
Wish you were here, now I write this from the plane, drinking cheap champagne.
Wondering why two people got so far apart.
I wish you were here (Here in London where the rain is pouring down).
I wish you were here (On this airplane headed back to New York town).
I'll never leave you alone again, I'm coming home, but until then,
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here.
