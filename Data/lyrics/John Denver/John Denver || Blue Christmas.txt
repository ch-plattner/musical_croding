I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red
on a green Christmas tree
Just won't mean a thing if
you're not here with me

And when those blue heartaches start hurting,
I'll have some blue memories for certain;
You'll be doing all right
with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Decorations of red
on a green Christmas tree
Just won't mean a thing if
you're not here with me

And when those blue heartaches start hurting,
I'll have some blue blue memories for certain;
You'll be doing all right
with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.
Yes I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.
