
Hey there, Mr. lonely heart, if you could find the time,
I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find
the answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed.
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need?
Or is it really love itself that always wants to give
the heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives?

Hey there, Mr. cold, cold heart, I know I could be wrong
to think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong as to gather everyone of us,
like one big family, to share with one another all we have all we see.
It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere, the same.
And that the only differences are really just the names.

We can join the children's song and show them that we care,
let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where.
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger, reconcile.
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile.
True love is still the answer, and we are still the way,
the gift is in the giving, and in living, what we say.

And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you,
to ask for all that you can give and all that you can do.
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed
is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need.
It's in the heart of all us, true love is all we need.
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need.
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need.
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need.
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need.
