
Another day is over, I'm on my way home. Knowing you'll be waiting is all I need to know.
'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired, wrap your arms around me.
I'm in the mood, let's build a fire, till the embers retire we'll be lost in a world of ecstasy.

Forget about your troubles, forget about my woes.
You're the one who comforts me whenever I feel alone.
'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired, wrap your arms around me.
I'm in the mood, let's build a fire, till the embers retire we'll be lost in a world of ecstasy.

You're everything I could imagine. You fill me up with such passion, baby.
Eternity is not long enough for you and me.
'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired, wrap your arms around me.
I'm in the mood, let's build a fire, till the embers retire we'll be lost in a world of ecstasy.
