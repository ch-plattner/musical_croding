In a spaceship over the mountains, chasing rainbows in the setting sun.
Leaving heart and home for the city of angels, I feel my life is undone.
There are pathways winding below me, in pleasure I've gone where they go.
In the quiet stillness, I can hear symphonies, the loveliest music I know.
How can I leave you again? I must be clear out of my mind.
Lost in a storm I've gone blind, oh, how can I leave you again.

Oh, it's been a long time since I've listened, still longer since I've walked with you.
For the first time I know what I'm missing, some answers are no longer true.
So I question the course that I follow. I'm doubtful and deep in despair.
My heart is filled with impossible notions, can it be you no longer care?
Still I ride on the winds of a high wind blowing steady and strong behind me.
As the clouds surrender, my fate is for certain, I'm a sailor who runs to the sea.
How can I leave you again? I must be clear out of my mind.
Lost in a storm I've gone blind, oh, how can I leave you again.
How can I leave you again? I must be clear out of my mind.
Lost in a storm I've gone blind, oh, how can I leave you again.
