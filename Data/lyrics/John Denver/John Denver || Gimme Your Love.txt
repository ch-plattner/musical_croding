
Oh, spring is here and love is in the air, overflowing with life and I don't have a care.
I'm gonna see you shining like your diamond ring, every cell in my body is singing,
gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love.
You gotta gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love, gimme your love.

All around I see signs of rebirth, resurrection, renewal, celebration of life on earth.
Baby, won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow.
I love you, I want you, please say you'll gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love.
You gotta gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love, gimme your love.

People think I'm crazy as I walk along the street, I don't understand them anyway.
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet and that's the way I know it's gonna stay.
Baby, won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow I love you, I want you,
please say you'll gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love.
You gotta gimme your love forever, oh, oh, gimme your love, love, love, love, gimme your love.
