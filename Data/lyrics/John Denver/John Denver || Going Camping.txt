
I got my gear in my pack
I got my pack on my back
Today's the day I'm going camping

Just got the goahead sign

The weather's gonna be fine
Today's the day I'm going camping
I'm gonna pitch me a tent

Won't have to pay any rent
It looks like ev'rything is "A O.K."
As far as I can see
I think it's gonna be a perfect camping day

The trees and animals
And clear blue skies
A waterfall comes tumbling right before my eyes

Birds that fly

Above a mountain stream
It's absolutely perfect better than a dream
Peace and quiet

Where the Good Lord smiled
Fields and fields of flowers growing wild
This is
Just where I belong I'm a mother Nature's child

It's time to hit the trail
To hit the hill and dale
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains

It's great to reach the snow

And see the world below
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains
Each time we stop to eat

We get to rest our feet
And we'll make it if we take slow
'Cause the best way to climb
Is one step at a time and hicking is the only way to go

I got my gear in my pack
The trees and animals
It's time to hit the trail

I got my pack on my back
And clear blue skies
To hit the hill and dale

Today's the day I'm going camping
A waterfall comes tumbling right before my eyes
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains

Just got the goahead sign
Birds that fly
It's great to reach the snow

The weather's gonna be fine
Above a moun-tain stream
And see the world below

Today's the day I'm goin' camping
It's absolutely perfect better than a dream
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains

I'm gonna pitch me a tent Won't
Peace and quiet
Each time we stop to eat

Have to pay any rent
Where the Good Lord smiled
We get to rest our feet

It looks like ev'rything is "AO. K."
Fields and fields of flowers growing wild
And we'll make it if we take it slow

As far as I can see
