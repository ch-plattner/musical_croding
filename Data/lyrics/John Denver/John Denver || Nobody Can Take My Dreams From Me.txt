
There are minstrels and beggars, poems in the sight of the king.
Sometimes they sleep in the daytime, come out in the night time and sing.
They come into the castle, through whatever window they can find, they come into your mind.
Dreams of flying, dreams of being free. No one can take my dreams from me.
No one can take my dreams from me.

You can bind me in chains, lock me up in a jailhouse to rot.
And if you come to see me, you might think I'm there but I am not.
They can sail into prison, find their way through any basement door, they can offer you more.
Dreams of flying, dreams of being free. No one can take my dreams from me.
No one can take my dreams from me.

You can take my money, take my reputation, can even take my color TV,
no one can take my dreams from me. No one can take my dreams from me.
No one can take my dreams from me.
