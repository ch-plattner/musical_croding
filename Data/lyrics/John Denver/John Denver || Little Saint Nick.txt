Well, way up north where the air gets cold,
there's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told.
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red,
and he spends the whole year working out on his sled,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

Just a little bobsled, calls it old Saint Nick,
But he sparks the buggy with a full speed stick.
He's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel,
Then he gives gas and just watch him peel, yeah,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

Run run reindeer, run run reindeer, run run reindeer,
run run reindeer, run run run, yeah!

He's rolling through the snow at a frightful speed
with a half dozen deer with Rudy to lead.
He's gotta wear his goggle cause the snow really flies,
and he's cruising every path with a little surprise,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,
(run run run run reindeer!)
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,
(run run run run reindeer!)
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,
(run run run run reindeer!) all right, that's nice.  Sorry.
