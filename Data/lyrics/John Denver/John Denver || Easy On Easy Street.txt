
My way was the hard way, didn't know it at the time.
I could've had it made by now, but I was too busy trying.
Your way was so easy, thank God you came along.
You took me to a special place where nothing can go wrong.

Easy on Easy Street, You're the one who gave me love and made my life complete.
Easy on Easy Street, the dream I pictured in my heart could never be this sweet.
Every thing I'll ever need is here with you on Easy Street.

I know you're up to something, what's son you're little heart?
It really doesn't matter 'cause I know I'll love my part.

Easy on Easy Street, You're the one who gave me love and made my life complete.
Easy on Easy Street, the dream I pictured in my heart could never be this sweet.
Every thing I'll ever need is here with you on Easy,
Easy on Easy Street, You're the one who gave me love and made my life complete.
Easy on Easy Street, the dream I pictured in my heart could never be this sweet.
Every thing I'll ever need is here with you on Easy Street.
