
If our lives could lie before us like a straight and narrow highway
so that we could see forever, long before we took the ride,
we would never look to heaven, make a wish or climb a mountain,
'cause we'd always know the answer what's on the other side.
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around.
But we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down,
this life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.

So let's walk the road together, who knows what we'll find tomorrow.
Maybe good times, maybe sorrow will be waiting round the bend
Given time, two hearts discover what they're feeling for each other.
At the best we'll end up lovers, at the least we'll make a friend.
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around.
But we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down,
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around.
But we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down,
this life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
