Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
all those things that don't change, come what may.
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on,
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall.
Got some friends that I can go to working for.
Still, I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time.
But we've been through that a hundred times or more.

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
all those things that don't change, come what may.
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on,
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are going good,
you could meet me if I sent you down the fare.
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do,
and the wind sure blows cold way out there.

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
all those things that don't change, come what may.
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on,
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
Yes, our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on,
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
