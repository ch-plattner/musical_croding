
Be sure it's true when you say, I love you. It's a sin to tell a lie.
Millions of hearts have been broken, Just because these words were spoken.
I love you, Yes I do, I love you. If you break my heart I'll die.
So be sure it's true, When you say I love you, it's a sin to tell a lie.

Cross my heart, hope to die, I'll never, never ever tell another white lie.
Took a little girl out on a date last night,
Next to her Greta Gerty would have looked all right.
Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea, cause I said "Baby you look good to me."
I told her I loved her, but oh, how I lied, and now she's getting set to be my blushing bride.
If she leads me to the altar, I'm sunk cause I can't tell the preacher I was drunk.
So God have mercy on a "no account sinner,"
Give me one more chance to let another guy win her.
Cross my heart and hope to die, I'll never, never, never, tell one more time,
I'll never tell another white lie, do do di do do.
