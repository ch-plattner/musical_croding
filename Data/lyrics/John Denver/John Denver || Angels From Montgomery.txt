
I am an old woman, named after my mother, my old man is another child that's grown old.
If dreams were lightning, and thunder were desire,
this old house would have burnt down a long time ago.
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery, make me a poster of an old rodeo.
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to, to believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

When I was a young girl, I had me a cowboy.
He weren't much to look at, just a free rambling man.
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,
the years just flow by like a broken down dam.
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery, make me a poster of an old rodeo.
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to, to believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em in there buzzing.
And I ain't done nothing, since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning,
come home in the evening and have nothing to say?
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery, make me a poster of an old rodeo.
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to, to believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery, make me a poster of an old rodeo.
