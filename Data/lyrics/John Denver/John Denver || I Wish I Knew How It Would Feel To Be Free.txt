
And I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish that I could break
All the chains holding me
I wish I could say
All the things that I'd like to say
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear
I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove every doubt that keeps us apart
And I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
Every man should be free

I wish I could live

Like I'm longin' to live
I wish I could give
What I'm longin' to give
And I wish I could do
All the things I'd like to do
You know they still are quite a few
Yes Sir...
And I'm way way over due

I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found out I could fly
So long to the sun
And look down upon Ihe sea
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be free
Yeah
