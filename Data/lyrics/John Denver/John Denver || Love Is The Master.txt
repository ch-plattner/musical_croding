
Almost exactly a year ago, I came here for the very first time.
Looking up at the Spanish windows from a trail on the edge of the timberline.
I've been off on a journey to find myself, maybe find my way back home.
Been many an hour all by myself, in the darkest of nights I was never ever alone.

Back in the San Juan Mountains again on a ride with some good old boys.
Telling stories around a campfire, the sound of laughter is the loudest noise.
There's something in a night in the wilderness, it's a magical thing to me.
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter, and your life is everything that you'd like it to be.
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow, you can feel it in the chill of the wind.
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow, today is the day that my life starts all over again.

I guess that it's just about over now, everything's about to change.
Everything's a brand new number, darling, everything's a brand new game.
And it's funny I could even call you that after all the pain we've been through,
Ah, but time is the master of healing, love is the master of everything that we do.
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow, you can feel it in the chill of the wind.
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow, today is the day that my life starts all over again.
