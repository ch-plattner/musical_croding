Born on a quiet morning, just a dream in someone's eye.
A dream that's like a promise meant to be.
Giving rise to speculation on a place called paradise.
If I've ever been there it's when you were with me.
You're so beautiful, I can't believe my eyes each time I see you again.
You're so beautiful that I'm in paradise each time I see you again.

I remember some hidden valley where the skies are never still
and alpine meadows burn in the evening light.
I remember the path to glory and the way around the hill
and I remember true love's eyes shining in the night.
You're so beautiful, I can't believe my eyes each time I see you again.
You're so beautiful that I'm in paradise each time I see you again.

And if paradise is everything you see, then the place you must be coming from is ecstasy.
You're so beautiful, I can't believe my eyes each time I see you again.
You're so beautiful that I'm in paradise each time I see you again.
I just want to see you again, I want to be with you again,
I just need to love you again, I just want to touch you again, I just need to love you again.
