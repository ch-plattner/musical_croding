There are those who can live with the things they don't believe in,
They are giving up their lives for something that is less than it can be.
Some have longed for a home in a place of inspiration, some will find the emptiness inside.
By giving it all for the things that they believe, they believe.
Maybe it's just a dream in me, maybe it's just my style.
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found.
Given the possibility of living up to the dream in me,
you know that I'll be reaching for higher ground.

I will stand on my own, I will live up to this vision.
I will trust in what I feel and follow my heart until it brings me home, brings me home
Maybe it's just a dream in me, maybe it's just my style.
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found.
Given the possibility of living up to the dream in me,
you know that I'll be reaching for higher ground.

Keep me through the night, lead me to the light.
Teach me the magic of wonder, give me the spirit to fly.
Maybe it's just a dream in me, maybe it's just my style.
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found.
Given the possibility of living up to the dream in me,
you know that I'll be reaching for higher ground.
Maybe it's just a dream in me, maybe it's just my style.
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found.
Given the possibility of living up to the dream in me,
you know that I'll be reaching for higher ground.
