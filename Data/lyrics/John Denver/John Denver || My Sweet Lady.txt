
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me?
Did you think our time together was all gone?
Lady, you've been dreaming. I'm as close as I can be.
And I swear to you our time has just begun.
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind. I promise I will stay right here beside you.
Today our lives were joined, became entwined.
I wish that you could know how much I love you.

Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do?
Are there meanings that you've never seen before?
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true.
And it's like I've never ever loved before.
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind. I promise I will stay right here beside you.
Today our lives were joined, became entwined.
I wish that you could know how much I love you.
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me?
Did you think our time together was all gone?
Lady, you've been dreaming. I'm as close as I can be.
And I swear to you our time has just begun.
