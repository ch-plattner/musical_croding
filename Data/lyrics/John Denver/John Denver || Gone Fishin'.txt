
Gone fishin'
There's a sign upon your door
Gone fishin'
I ain't workin' anymore
There's a hoe out in the sun
Where you left a row half done
I said "Hoe-in' ain't no fun"
You ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin' - by a shady, wady pool
Gone fishin', - man, you really play it cool
We don't wish to be annoyed, Mister John,
And Mister Floyd, we're fishin'
Instead of just a-wishin'
We're fishin' instead of just a-wishin'
Oh, yeah!
