
There's such a high wind blowing and it's snowing in my bed.
Oh, baby, you started flowers growing where nothing grew instead.
I need something to hide the failure of my garden and the way it grew.
Oh, baby, I didn't know I could depend on you.
It's such a high wind blowing, I won't get to sleep tonight.
I think that warm wind feel's all right.
It's such a high wind blowing, I won't get to sleep at all.
I feel like I'm gonna fall into your fine, high wind.

You look like twilight falling on the ocean in the setting sun.
Oh, baby, do you know what you have done?
I feel like you have changed my mind about living the way I do.
Oh, baby, I didn't know I could depend on you.
It's such a high wind blowing, I won't get to sleep tonight.
I think that warm wind feel's all right.
It's such a high wind blowing, I won't get to sleep at all.
I feel like I'm gonna fall into your fine, high wind.
