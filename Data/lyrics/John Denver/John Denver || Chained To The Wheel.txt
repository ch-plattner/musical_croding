
Know what you really need
You can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed
Ain't life enough
Call this survival
Don't pray for a sign

Know what you really want
You can't get it back
Down on the water front
Better watch out jack
Nights on the mainline
Rust on the rail

I've seen 'em swindle this town
I've seen 'em tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I've felt the thunder chained to the wheel

Know what you mean to me
Goes deeper than that
Can't fight your destiny
Don't know where it's at
Don't look for light'n
Or pray for a sign

I've heard the legends
I've watched the skies
I feel the power
The flame in your eyes

I've seen 'em swindle this town
I've seen 'em tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I've felt the thunder chained to the wheel
