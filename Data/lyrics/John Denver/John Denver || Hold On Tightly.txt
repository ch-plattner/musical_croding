
Lost in a boat on the ocean, lost in a ship out at sea.
Lost in the dark of misfortune, where is a light I can see?
Where is the highway to heaven, where is the love we all need?
Where is the peace that we long for, where is the man who is free?
Here in the heart there is freedom, here in the heart there is peace.
Here in the heart is the answer to questions much deeper than these.
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game.
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame.

Some will take fame over fortune, some will take love over gold.
Some will pray only for power, some never want to grow old.
Some see the day that is coming, some only see what has passed.
Someone will always be first in line, someone will always be last.
Here in the heart there is freedom, here in the heart there is peace.
Here in the heart is the answer to questions much deeper than these.
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game.
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame.
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game.
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame.
