
Joseph and Joe, the priest and the cowboy, the places they've been to, the spaces they're in.
For a time between storms at the side of a mountain,
with another man's family, family and friends.
Joseph can give you the keys to the kingdom, he'll put you in touch with the spirit of man.
Joe loves the desert but lives in the mountains, his closest companion, a left-handed man.
Where do you go if you've got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you've never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?

Joseph, I lost you in some other city, our paths are not crossing, were way out of time.
Joe how the seasons have drifted between us, or is it your vision much greater than mine?
Take heed of the darkness which gathers around us, a fire that consumes us, forever to burn.
Then look to the sun for our father is with us, our mother will teach us what we need to learn.
Where do you go if you've got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you've never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?
Tell me where do you go if you've got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you've never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?
