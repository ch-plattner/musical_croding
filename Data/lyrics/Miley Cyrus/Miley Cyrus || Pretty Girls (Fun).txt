If You came here to have a good time
If You came here to have a good time

One shot, two shot, three shot, four
This the one will bring the pretty girls to the floor
Twerk it, drop it, Miley in here
Party turnt up, Miley, Miley in here

[CHORUS:]
And all the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun
All the pretty girls just wanna have fun, fun, fun, fun...

If You came here to have a good time
If You came here to have a good time (Turn Up)
If You came here to have a good time,
Came here to have a good time

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest of them all?

Fun, fun, fun, fun...

[CHORUS]
