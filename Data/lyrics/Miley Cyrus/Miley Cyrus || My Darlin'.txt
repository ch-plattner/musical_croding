I walked through a puddle of water and I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar, for better or for worse

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh, my darling, stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie, and it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh, my darling stand by me, stand by me

I ain't pop no Molly but you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me high
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop

We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together

They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk, baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh, my darling, stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

Stand by me, yeah, my darling, stand by me, yeah
Yeah, 3D, yeah, movie, we gon' make a 3D, 3D

Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh, my darling, stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh, my darling, stand by me
