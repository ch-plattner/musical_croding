
You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick
But you wish you did
You always second guess,wonder if i say yes
but you just lose out every time

If you only knew what i talked about
When I'm with my friends just hangin' out
Then you'd have the inside scoop
On what to say, what to do
That way when you play the game
Baby you could never lose

[Chorus:]
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall

You'd love to know, the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
Your always second guess, wonder if
There's other guys im flirting with
You should know by now

If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm comin' thru
Don't you wish that you could
See me every second of the day
That way you would have no doubt
That baby i would never stray

[Chorus:]
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall

A little communication
Well that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay

and what i say is
come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is

Don't You
Don't You
Don't You
Don't you wish you were a...
Hey!

[Chorus:]
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
