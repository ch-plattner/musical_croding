The milky, milky, milk [x4]

The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull

The milky, milky, milk
Your tongue milking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars

I feel like a slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
The presence melts away
Now that you and me are one

Little 'nilla sundae and the greatest truth appear
That open up the flood tides of the last 2 billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is gone
But I knew that I knew it
From the milky, milky gods

The milky, milky, milk
Your lips get me so wet
While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead

The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it

I feel like a slab of butter
Yeah, I'm digging it
That is melting in the sun
Yeah, I'm digging it
The presence melts away
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, yeah
