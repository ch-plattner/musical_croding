
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness is sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow

The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep
So deep

Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
I see you happy
Oh sun, oh sun
