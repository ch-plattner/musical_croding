In your bed, or in your car
On the earth, or up in the stars
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, going too far

At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart

You take me higher than I’ve been before
Don’t laugh when I say that cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But I’m a little buzzed, so I’m keeping it real

I tried to take it slow, but
When you're around me, my pot’s about to blow, and
Everything you do just turns me on
So let’s go to my room, and "na, na"

Shit's 'bout to get real freaky I can feel it
I hope you're ready, I'm into whatever
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky I can feel it
Don't you worry, you won't regret it

It never felt right to be so wrong
I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
Cause I got too good at just doing it myself

At your dad’s place, or at your moms
And if they’re both home, we can go out on the lawn
And I wanna walk around while wearing high heels
After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills
And then..

Shit's 'bout to get real
Freaky I can feel it
But don't you worry, you won't hurt it
Shit's 'bout to get real
Freaky I can feel it
Don't you worry, you won't regret it
