What could you hope to achieve
When I'm cryin' and you know why?
How do you find your reasons
In my deepest, darkest night?

I keep givin' you up.

I remember when
You were my only friend.
Now I'm not sure you can
Feel like that again.

I keep givin' you up.

[Chorus:]
And my,
You know my mind's made up this time.
There's no goin' back to find
What we had.
And I know
There's no light here left to shine,
There's no wrong where there's no right.
So enough.
I'm givin' you up.

All the things that you said –
Well, you seem to forget –
Dance around in my head every night.

And there's a battle within
That I'll never win.
'cause it's me that I'm up against.
It's my heart versus common sense.

Can I give you up?

[Chorus:]
And my,
You know my mind's made up this time.
There's no goin' back to find,
What we had.
And I know
There's no light here left to shine,
There's no wrong where there's no right.
So enough.
I'm giving you up.

Strip the layers.
Make me better.
Help me get out clean.

Show your colors.
I'm slipping under.
Help me through this, please.

[Chorus:]
And my,
You know my mind's made up this time.
There's no goin' back to find
What we had.
And I know
There's no light here left to shine,
There's no wrong where there's no right.
So enough.
I'm giving you up.
Yeah, yeah.

My mind's made up,
Yeah, yeah.
I'm giving you up,
I'm giving you up.
Hey, yeah.
I'm giving you up.
