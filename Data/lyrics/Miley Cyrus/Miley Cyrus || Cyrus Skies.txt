Eyes are strange, they say everything
While I'm lost, they just try to sing
Singing something, I can never
Fall forever and ever
So I try to understand it all
But I fell to live it up
I'm still standing here forever
Without sunshine in my mind

Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar
Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar
There's some kind of love
That's so much higher
Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar

I've seen death, I've seen truth
I've heard lies, I've seen both too
I've seen happiness, I've seen anger
I've seen the Sun come up and I've kissed the moon
I've heard voices, through the fog
I've seen figures, in my bed
I feel protected by things I don't understand
And that's more than you could say

Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar
Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar
There's some kind of love
That's so much higher
Yeah I've been alive
But I've been a liar
