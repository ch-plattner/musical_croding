[Miley Cyrus:]
Sometimes I wonder, if everything changed
How would we make out?
And now suddenly thunder, and everything changed
There's this big dark cloud, hovering

Hovering
Hovering 
Hovering

[Trace Cyrus:]
You always said that we'd make it through

[Miley Cyrus:]
Trembling
Stumbling
Fumbling

For the words that say
That I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

We go through the motions 
Like everything's settled
But it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable
Still holding on
When there's all this doubt, hovering

Hovering
Hovering 
Hovering

[Trace Cyrus:]
You always said that we'd make it through

[Miley Cyrus:]
Trembling
Stumbling
Fumbling

For the words that say
That I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

[Miley Cyrus (Trace Cyrus)]:
And maybe we're just older (older)
Just a little older (older)
Cause the fact that this is over
The fact that this is over with you, then

[Miley Cyrus:]
Hovering
Hovering 
Hovering

[Trace Cyrus:]
You always said that we'd make it through

[Miley Cyrus:]
Trembling
Stumbling
Fumbling

For the words that say
That I'm leaving you
Leaving you

Trembling
Stumbling
Fumbling

For the words that say
That I'm leaving you

[Trace Cyrus:]
You always said that we'd make it through
You always said that we'd make it through
