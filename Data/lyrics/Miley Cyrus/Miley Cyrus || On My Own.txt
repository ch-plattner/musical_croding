Hey!
I ain't looking at chu
For no particular reason
It's just a good spot, for me to be in
I gotta open that door, oh yeah
I gotta Get it open! Hey!
I'm part the way through, just like a robber
And smile for the camera 
Damn, I feel awesome
But she doesn't know more, hey! 
Gotta get it open, heyyy

You will never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, cause, cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own!

Hey!
I'll find a way, yeah 
And I'll do it on my own
Hey! 
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
I will get it done with the help from no one 
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young 
Don't be afraid of alone, you'll get it done on your own

Uh, woo!
I know you're in there! Open up, open up!
Just like the Feds, looking for the subs 
Three knocks at the door
Uh, I gotta get it open 
I'm so confused, with all the traffic
I'mma skip the line
Who cares what happens!
I gotta stay on that course
Uh, I gotta get it open!

You will never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, cause, cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own!

Hey!
I'll find a way, yeah 
And I'll do it on my own
Hey! 
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
I will get it done with the help from no one 
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young 
Don't be afraid of alone, you'll get it done on your own

You will never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, cause, cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own

Hey!
I'll find a way, yeah 
And I'll do it on my own
Hey! 
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
I will get it done with the help from no one 
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young 
Don't be afraid of alone, you'll get it done on your own
