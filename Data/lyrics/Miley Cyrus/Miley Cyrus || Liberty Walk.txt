Don't live a lie
This is your one life, oh
Don't let it lie
You won't get lost
Just walk
Just walk

Oooh
It's a liberty walk
It's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty
Oooh
It's a liberty walk
It's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty

[Spoken]
Here's to all the ones
Tryin to hold ya back
Tryin to make ya feel like your less than that
Givin nothin mo' better than to make ya crack
But really just tryin to put your dreams off-track
And you know in the end it'll be okay
Cause all that really matters are the steps ya take
And everything else falls into place
There's no price to pay
I say

Well alright (Alright)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, live it (Oooh!)
Well alright (Alright)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, live it
Woah woah oooh

It's a liberty walk, walk
Sayin goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feelin your heart again
Breathin new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk!
Free yourself
Slam the door!
Not a prisoner anymore!
Liberty
Liberty
Li-Li-Liberty
Liberty
Li-Li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

Don't be afraid to make a move
It won't hurt you
Just do what you were born to do
And everything works out right
Don't listen to all the people who hate
Cause all they do is help
Make your mistakes for ya
But they don't own ya
I just told ya

Alright (Alright)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, live it (Oooh!)
Well alright (Alright)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it
Woah woah oooh

It's a liberty walk, walk
Sayin goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feelin your heart again
Breathin new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk!
Free yourself
Slam the door!
Not a prisoner anymore!
Liberty

Li-Li-Liberty
Liberty

It's a liberty walk, walk

Just walk this way
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let whatcha do (Walk!)
Don't take the abuse (Walk!)
Move to the truth
People, come on, that means you!

It's a liberty walk, walk
Sayin goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feelin your heart again
Breathin new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk!
Free yourself
Slam the door!
Not a prisoner anymore!
Liberty

Li-Li-Liberty
