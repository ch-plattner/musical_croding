[Chorus:]
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 1:]
I used to believe love conquered all
'Cause that's what I've seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see real life's much different

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us fail
We tried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back
To what we had, to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus:]
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

I've turned into someone else

[Verse 2:]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile

I can't stand to see us fail
We tried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back
To what we had, to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus:]
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Bridge x3:]
Love is patient
Love is selfless
Love is hopeful
Love is kind
Love is jealous
Love is selfish
Love is helpless
Love is blind

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I've turned into someone else
