Wake up
Here I go
Cram it all down my throat
Stomach's so full
That I wish I could choke
7 A.M. my head's
Already in a spin
As soon as I'm out that door
Bam
It hits me like a ton of those red bricks
Can't dig myself out of this
Highest ditch
This madness
I swear sometimes
I can't tell which way is up
Which way is down
It's all up in my face
Need to push it away
Somebody push it away
So all that I can hear

[Chorus:]
Is a simple song
Sing along now
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la

Mid day
Sun beatin' on the concrete
Burnin' up my feet
Too many cars on the street
The noise
The red
The green
Makes me wanna scream
It's 5 o'clock
Now it's bumper on bumper on bumper
Horn's honkin'
Nobody's lookin' but everybody's talkin'
Just another day
On this highway
I swear sometimes
I can't tell which way is up
Which way is down
It's all up in my face
Need to push it away
Somebody push it away
'cause all I wanna hear

[Chorus]

Hey

Sing along now
(la la la la la la la la la )
Sing along
(la la la la la la la la la)

What I'd give
To turn it off
And make it stop
Make it stop
You gotta make it stop
So all that I can hear

[Chorus]

La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la
