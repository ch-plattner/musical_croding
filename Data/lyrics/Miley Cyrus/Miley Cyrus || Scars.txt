
I can pretend that I don't see you,
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around,
(When you're around)
I can say that nothing was right,
But we know if I looked in your eyes I'd break down,
(yeah, let's break down)

[chorus:]
If I could, have just one night, to be with you, and make it right,
To what we were, and what we are,
It's hidden in the scars,
If I could, take you there,
I wont let go, this I swear,
You wont have to wonder what we are,
Cause you wont have to ever look to far,
Its in the scars, Its hidden in the scars,

If I told you that I love you,
But I'm doing alright without you it'd be a lie, But I could try,
I'd run 1000 miles, believe me,
You're the only one, I want to bring me to break down,
(yeah let's break down!)

[chorus]

Yeah I'll tell you all my secrets,
All the ones I've kept inside,
And Ill give you all the reasons,
That you faded from my life,
I won't let you go, baby come here close, I won't let you walk away

[chorus]

Its in the scars,
Yeah-yeah-eh-eh-ehhhhh-yeah-eh

I can pretend that I don't see you,
& I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when your around
