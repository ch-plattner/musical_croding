
I've been
Runnin'
In circles all day long
I'm out
Of breath
But I'm still goin' strong

I'm gonna get you yeah
No matter what they say
You think I'm losin'
But I always get my way
(Hey)

[Chorus:]
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you
This ain't no time for your bad attitude
Don't gimme
That face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'cause my heart's already in it
And I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it
Don't walk away

(When I'm talkin' to you)

You act
Act like
That I don't have a clue
You think
You know it all
But I'm so onto you

You think you've figured out
Just how to win this game
I'm on your tracks yeah
I know every move you make
(Hey)

[Chorus]

I won't give up just like that
I'm gonna make you mine
If it takes everything I have

[Chorus]

(Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you)
When I'm talkin' to you
(This ain't no time for your bad attitude)
Yeah

Don't gimme
That face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'cause my heart's already in it
And I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it
Don't walk away
