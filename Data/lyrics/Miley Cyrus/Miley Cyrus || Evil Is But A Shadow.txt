
Evil is but a shadow
That always accompanies the good
You can try to have a world
A world without the shadow
But it'll be a dark, dark and cold place world
Cause it would be a world, a world without light too

The lights of nature
The light of the true
The light of silence
The light of all I do
The brighter it shines from the mountain
The more evil hides in its hole
Enjoy so hard to defeat us
A world starting to lose your control
Trol, lose your control
Trol, lose your control
Trol, lose your control
Trol, lose your control

We won't stop
We'll let it go, it drop
How'd it get to be so obvious?
I'll have fun
We won't stop
We'll let it fucking drop
We won't stop, oh
I'll have fun

Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
