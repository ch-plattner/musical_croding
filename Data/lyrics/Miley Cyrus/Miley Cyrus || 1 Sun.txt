
We all walk around
And waste life
It's just gonna go on forever
Like there's some eternal endless supply
Of what it takes to keep us alive
There might be a day
When everything goes away
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is
We need to take time
To replace what's stolen from mother nature

We only had
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me
1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

I once heard
Grace Jones say
I have my own concept of time
I always think bout' that cause I've always felt like
I was running a little behind
What's in front of me
I don't know
Cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow

We only had
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me
1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

Wake up, world
Can't you see the earth is crying
Wake up, world
Can't you see all the clouds are dying
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue
I don't wanna see a cyclone
There's no sun, no moon, no me, no you

We only had
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me
1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)
