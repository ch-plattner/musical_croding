
Oh, Can we take care of her?
Oh, Maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination

Oh, The Earth is calling out
I wanna learn what it's all about but
Everything I read
Global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying

Wake up America
We're all in this together
It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to
You know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yea everything you do matters in some way

Stand up, I'll try if you will
Wake up, it's not a fire drill
All she needs is a little attention
Can you give her just a little attention?

Oh, it's easy to look away
But it's getting harder day by day
Everything I read
Global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying

C'mon!
Wake up America
We're all in this together
It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to
You know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yea everything you do matters in some way

I know that you don't want to hear it
Especially coming from someone so young
But in the backseat, yea, they want to hear it
(yeah you wanna hear it)

So come on, turn it up
Come on, turn it up
So come on (turn it up)

Wake up America (wake up)
We're all in this together
It's our home (it's our home)
So let's take care of it
You know that you want to
You know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yea everything you do matters in some way
