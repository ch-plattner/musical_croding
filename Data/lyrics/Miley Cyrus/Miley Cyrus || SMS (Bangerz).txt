Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)

All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me 'what you doing with that?'
Yeah, yeah, you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack

One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting on a man
To tell me where the fuck my seat be at, where Mike Will at?

[Chorus:]
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
Bangerz (bangerz),
She be strutting that stuff
I be strutting my stuff
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
Bangerz (bangerz)
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
Bangerz (bangerz)
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
Bangerz (bangerz),
She be strutting that stuff
I be strutting my stuff
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
Bangerz (bangerz)
She be strutting that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
I be strutting my stuff

[Britney Spears (Miley Cyrus):]
I'm flying high up on a bird, acrophobiac
Got slick, caught her eyeing down my purse, where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first,
They can call a hearse
'Cause if there's any violation I go off with that

Cat walk, slick talk, flirting with them big dogs
(Why I need these milli's when I got Billy on the speed dial)
(You know I'm on that meow)
Quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, calling time out

[Chorus]

The play boss, the play, got to get that big rock
Slip that on my hand, make that media big talk
The play boss, the play, sike that must be the purple
Got up in my brain, had me a little bit dismal

Bangerz (bangerz), bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), bangerz (bangerz)

I [4x]
I [4x]
I [4x]
I [4x]
