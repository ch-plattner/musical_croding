Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
(in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it

You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it
Then what you say forever for?
If forever's out the door,
I'll ignore when you call (no drama)

Drive my heart into the night
Yeah
You can drop the keys off in the morning
(in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it

You told me you were coming back
Right back
Promised it was real and I believed that
But if I fall for it again
I will be a fool
If our love is at the end
Then why do I still want you?
Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it

I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on

I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes
All I see are the lies
Been there, done that

No drama

Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
(in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it
