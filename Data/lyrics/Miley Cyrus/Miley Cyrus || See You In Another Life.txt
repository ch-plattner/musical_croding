
Well I believe in love, but not the kinda screws you up, no!

I believe in time and chance
Cause I’m not one for making plans
Well you’ll go down in history
And that’s just what it is to me
I believe in moving on
When sentimental and love is gone

But if I’m crying over you
I won’t lie even it’s hard to do
When you turn around
I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going but when you turn around I’ll be gone and that means goodbye

I believe in love but not the kinda breaks you up, no!
I don’t regret the day I felt
Kiss the life, I wish you well

But if I’m crying over you
I won’t lie even it’s hard to do
When you turn around
I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going but when you turn around I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye.

Well I know you’re full, full of good intentions yeah
But that don’t change a thing cause I’m already out of here
Oh, oh, oh
When you turn around I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going but when you turn around I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye
I see you in another life

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going but when you turn around I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going but when you turn around I’ll be gone and I mean goodbye
