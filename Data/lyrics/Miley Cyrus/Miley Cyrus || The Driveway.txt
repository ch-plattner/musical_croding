[Verse 1:]
After 12, not so well
Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell
What's round this bend?
No disgrace, about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Verse 2:]
A lot to say
But not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Bridge:]
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your tail lights fading
I try but it still won't fall
I remember what it feels like to know love
And have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road,
End of the road
