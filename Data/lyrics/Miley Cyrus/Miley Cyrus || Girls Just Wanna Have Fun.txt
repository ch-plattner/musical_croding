
I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "what you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)
(Girls, they wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)
(Girls, they wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)
(Girls, they wanna have)

When the working,when the working
When the working day is done
Oh when the working day is done
Oh girls the wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun) (have fun)
(Girls, they wanna have)

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)
(They wanna have fun)
(Girls, they wanna have)
