Imagining you're far away
Just searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
Our lives are our greatest art

I don't wanna change your mind
Coz I accept you for everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away

I can't tell you what the future holds
Or how to live
All I know is what feels right lights up my life again and again

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

Let's jump the sun
Let's find forever
Where does the time go?
Just live your life
You'll get another today, today, today
Forgiveness and love

'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

Let's jump the sun.... [fade to end]
