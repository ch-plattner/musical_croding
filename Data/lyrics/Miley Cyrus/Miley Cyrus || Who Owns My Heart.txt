Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy
Yeah

The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right

And I feel you
Comin through my veins
Am I into you?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus:]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love?
Or is it art?
Cause the way you got your body movin's
Got me confused
I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
(Oh)
Who owns my heart?
Is it love?
Or is it art?
Y-Y-Y-You know I wanna believe
That we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

The room is full but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art

And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feelin me?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]

So come on baby
Keep provokin' me
Keep on ropin' me
Like a rodeo
Baby pull me close
Come on here we go
Here we go
Here we go

And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feelin me?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]

Who owns my heart?
Who owns my heart?
Heart, heart, heart, heart...
