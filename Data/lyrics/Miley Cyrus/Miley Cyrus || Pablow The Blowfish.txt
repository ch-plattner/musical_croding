
How can I love
Someone I never touched
You lived under the water
But I love you so much
You never been on land
And you never seen the sky
You don't know what a cloud is
Why does everything I love have to die
They all wanted to see
You be as big as you could be
But I couldn't let that be
Thought keeping you small, might keeping you safe
If I could do it again
I'd release you to sea
‘Cause I can't bear to see
Something so wild just die in a tank

And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so much
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

On Saturday night
We all went out to eat
But I can never decide
So someone chose sushi
I got soup
And I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friends
Ruined my appetite

Oh, Pablow the blowfish
If they only knew you like I do
They'd love you too
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

I won't forget
Even one second we had
‘Cause you might be gone
But you could never be dead
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie
I heard she was quite the lady
Maybe you'll find her and you can make babies
That'd be kind of crazy

If Pablow the blowfish
Found love deep in the sea
Then that would mean
Pablow the blowfish
Is better off than here with me

But Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad
