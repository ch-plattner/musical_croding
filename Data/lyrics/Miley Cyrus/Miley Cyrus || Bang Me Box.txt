
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking baby
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be yours baby

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture position my body
Wherever you like just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up cause I'm screaming
What are you doing to me
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
I know just what I need, what I came here to do
I've been thinking baby, been mostly about you

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face I want you to eat it baby
