When you get to the money, it ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love.
When you learn how to love, it ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party.
When you party everyday, it ain't nothing but a party

Love, money, party (money, party) [4x]
We want love, money, party

If I can't trust then why am I giving my heart
In exchange for him to love me?
'Cause there ain't much
Difference in a one night stand than one that ain't for me
Is it too much?
'Cause you hate that you love everything that he do and you can't deny you wanna
So what,
My heart'll light a fire in this bitch and blow it

Money ain't nothing,
Money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if ya sittin' on a trill
Money ain't nothing,
After that run out what about the real and the way you feel?
Money get low and the DJ stop, then the music slow down, and the shit get blurry

Love, money, party, yeah.

I've been through heartbreaks,
Probably it's much for anybody with a human heart to take
You know something not too good to elaborate
But I've been left in a lobby
I done been through the fire,
I done been the girl on the side
I done laid it all on the line
And now they growing up
I bet you regret it 'cause it just don't taste like me

Money ain't nothing,
Money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if ya sittin' on a trill
Money ain't nothing.
