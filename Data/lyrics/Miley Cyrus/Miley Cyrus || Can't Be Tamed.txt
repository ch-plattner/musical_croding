
For those who don't know me,
I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way,yep
24 hours a day
'cause I'm hot like that

Every guy, everywhere
just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten,
'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money
flyin' out the hands
They try to change me
but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't, I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

If there was a question about my intentions,
I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya
Or tell you to go to hell
(I'm not a brat like that)
I'm like a puzzle
but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this,
we can make some magic,
I'm wrong like that

I wanna fly,
I wanna drive,
I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't, I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

Well I'm not a trick you play,
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake,
I'm not a fake,
It's set in my DNA
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

I wanna fly,
I wanna drive,
I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't, I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
