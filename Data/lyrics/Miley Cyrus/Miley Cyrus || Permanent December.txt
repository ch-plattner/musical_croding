
I've been to London,
Been to Paris,
Australia and Rome
There's sexy boys in every city
But they're not what I want
Some got money
Some got fame
Some got cars
Some got clothes
But if it just ain't you
Then I don't wanna know

[Pre-chorus:]
Cuz baby now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm comin' home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

[Chorus:]
It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no

I've been to New York
And to L.A
And to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in every city
No one kept me amused
But don't call me a Lolita
Cuz I don't let 'em through
Cuz I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone and it's you

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Hey!
What do you say?
Cuz I been all around the world
And they just ain't the same
Hey!
What do you say?
Without my baby
I go crazy
And I just gotta scream (Ha!)

[Pre-chorus:]
But now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm comin' home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no

[Chorus]

[x2]
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
