I know this isnt what I wanted,
Never thought it'd come this far,
Just thinking back to where we started
& how we lost all that we are

[Nick:]
We were young & times were easy,
But I could see it's not the same.
I'm standing here but you don't see me,
I'd give it all for that to change.
And I dont want to lose her,
I dont want to let her go.

[Chorus:]
[Miley:]
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
Cause I will leave you alone.

[Nick:]
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

[Nick:]
And with every strike of lightning

[Miley:]
Comes a memory that lasts

[Miley:]
Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash

[Miley:]
Maybe I should give up

[Chorus:]
[Miley:]
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
Cause I will leave you alone.

[Nick:]
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

[Miley:]
Trying to keep the light from going in

[Miley:]
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm.

[Chorus:]
Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone
Flooded with all this pain, knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm
