
Oh, Karen
You take it all too hard
You been talking to those fools again
And they'll tear your world apart
Oh, Karen
You gotta try to understand
Gotta hold on to your soul
Cause they'll crush it if they can

So, Karen don't be sad
They're just a bunch of fools
And you can make them powerless
Don't let them make the rules
So, Karen don't be sad
You know the truth is true
The world can still be beautiful
That part's up to you
So, Karen don't be sad

Oh, Karen
You know you're only letting 'em win
By letting all their lies and hate
Destroy you from within-in
Oh, Karen
They've taken away your smile
But you can give it back to us
Just fake it for a while

So, Karen don't be sad
They're just a bunch of fools
And you can make them powerless
Don't let them make the rules
So, Karen don't be sad
You know the truth is true
The world can still be beautiful
That part's up to you
So, Karen don't be sad

So, Karen don't be sad
Don't let 'em win
Oh, don't let 'em win
Don't let them win
Don't let them win
Oh, don't let them win
Oh, don't let them win
Don't let them win
