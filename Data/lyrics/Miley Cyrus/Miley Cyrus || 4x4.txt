
Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Banged on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
The police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'm a do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and pussy tails

I'm in that passenger seat riding high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we're plum out of gas.
Let's go

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside like a pit bull in heat
Someone's coming so we head for the streets

I'm in that passenger seat flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we're plum out of gas.
Let's go

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

It's twelve o'clock and I don't want to party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Nelly:]
Are you sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an arch rest
And a four by four with the alter steps
And doing donuts underneath the old chest
I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
Think I ride or I die down to six thirty
Straight up chick like twelve o'clock
I don't know where he at, that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise her hand for a nigga
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
To the judge, he the one I love
Hell they can't tell, she don't even budge
Round and round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Miley Cyrus:]
I'm in that passenger seat flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we're plum out of gas
Let's go

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell, who can't you tell
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell, who can't you tell
