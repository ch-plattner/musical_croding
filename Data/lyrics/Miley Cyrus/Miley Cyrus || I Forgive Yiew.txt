I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

I didn't mean all the shit I say
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in our bed
You’re lucky I’m doing my yoga or you might be dead
I ain’t doin nothing that could take away my zen
If you are not enchanting then you fucked it up again
Life’s a bunch of tests, and we all just do our best
Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

You and I don't know
What goes on for us
If we leave through the stars, we’ll both know
What’s a life for us

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
