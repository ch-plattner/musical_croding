
These four walls
They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
It didn't take long
For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
It didn't take long
For me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls
Were not strong enough

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

Yeah
It's difficult
Watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault
You're not around

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
