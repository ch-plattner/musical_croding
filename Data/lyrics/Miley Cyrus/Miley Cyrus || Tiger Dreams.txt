The second impulse to stop it is probably wrong
Why do people only show forgiveness
When they want some pull in the sun?
So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin'
I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams
And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by tigers
While the sparrows start to sing in a tree

And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
But they also remind us we are dying
That's why we want to sing even more

I don't think we got where we were goin'
I had a dream that we were in a weird sky
Why do people let their dreams
Be somethin' so bad?
Such a weird fuckin' dream
Flyin' around into the sky like superman
Changing tigers and your arrows land sparrows
Those religious fucks will never understand

And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
Maybe it wasn't a dream
I can't really tell anymore

And we always end up singin' the same song
Cause we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
And we always end up singin' the same song
And we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
