
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
[x4]

The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself
So why you make me play on the road to something else?
Self control is not something I'm working on
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you

I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on [x4]

Make sure made a hole and now it's open full of sweat
Like a scorpion, I'm fire, stay in my summer den
I get extinguished by [?]
You turn me on, is all I can say about you

I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on [x4]
