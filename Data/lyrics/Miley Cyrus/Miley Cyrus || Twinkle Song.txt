I had a dream
David Bowie taught us how to skateboard
But he was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream
Took a helicopter
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds
Don't wanna come down
And I had a dream
We went on a safari
I said look at that lion, she reminds me of you
Cause you're the queen
And I had a dream
That you were dying
But I wasn't even crying, I just sang you to sleep
I sang you to sleep

But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?

And I had a dream
We robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream
That I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

What does it mean
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream

What does it mean?
What does it mean? What does it mean?
I had a dream
What does it mean? What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean? What does it mean?
What does it all mean?

And I had a dream
We were being chased by monsters
Maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared cause you were there
And I had a dream
We took karate
That's when you said you love me
You loved me

What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Fuck yeah
