Look what they've done to my song
Well, it's the only thing I could do half right
And it's turning out all wrong, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

Look what they've done to my brain, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Yeah, they picked it like a chicken bone
And they think I'm half insane, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain

Wish I could find a book to live in
Wish I could find a good book
Cause if I could find a real good book
I'd never have to come out and look at
Look what they've done to my song

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
And if people are buying tears
We'll be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain

But maybe I'll be alright, Ma
Yeah maybe I'll be okay
Cause if the people are buying tears
Then we'll be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

Look what they've done to my soul, Ma
Look what they've done to my soul
Yeah, they tied it in a plastic bag
And they shook me upside down, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

Look what they've done to my soul
