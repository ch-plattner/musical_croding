Chapter one we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Trying to figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
"This is what we are"
Then I gotta move on
You think this is everything
But this is no book of love

You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You told me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try and be in love right now

You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Fill the pages now
This chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that we'll become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining everyday
Then I'll be on your mind

You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish, leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Let me go to the top one more time
