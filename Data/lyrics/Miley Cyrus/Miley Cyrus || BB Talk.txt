Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall right back out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures
but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that,
I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know what?
Haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
It's everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really want an older you
I heard I change my mind with you often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Alright so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know,
the ones with the, the hands over the eyes, that means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute, well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
I don't really want an older you
I heard I change my mind with you often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
