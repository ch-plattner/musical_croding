Mmmm Yeah
Goodbye

We never said that we would be perfect
We only said that we'd try
And when you said that we were forever
I guess its just another lie
Let me slip right through your fingers,
I hope you know its real this time
Yeah, you know that I said I'd never come home for a last goodbye

I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
‘Cause I don’t wanna see you cry (Yeah)
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives (Yeah)
And I know you’re sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired (Yeah)
But I know that you’re gonna want me
To come home for a last goodbye

Layin in the dark with you against me
I can't even open my eyes
Cuz the pain has outweighed the pleasure
Don't think I can take another night
How has my best friend become such a stranger
It seemed like everything was fine
We've already been through this twice
And I'm never coming home for a last goodbye

I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
‘Cause I don’t wanna see you cry (Yeah)
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives (Yeah)
And I know you’re sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired (Yeah)
But I know that you’re gonna want me
To come home for a last goodbye

Oooooohh Yeahh [2x]

I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
‘Cause I don’t wanna see you cry (Yeah)
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives (Yeah)
And I know you’re sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired (Yeah)
But I know that you’re gonna want me
To come home for a last goodbye

You let me down, I gave you up
I took you back, I guess I can't blame ya
For this when I told myself
I’ll never say that last goodbye
I'll never say
That last goodbye
