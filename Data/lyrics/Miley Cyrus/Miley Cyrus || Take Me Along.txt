The city of angels is lonely at night
Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself is this love at all
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay
I'll be okay
I'll hold you close you'll stay forever

[Chorus:]
I don't understand why you're leaving me
I don't understand how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

You can pretend I don't exist,
But you see my face everytime you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay
I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever

[Chorus]

I watch you leave
Walk away tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time
And through the tears I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out.

[Chorus]

Don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here

I, I don't understand, how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
take my hand, I plead in tears
I don't understand why how can't take me with you
