
When we're driving
You’re sayin go faster
And when we’re singing to the radio
You’re sayin make it louder

And you roll another one
You wanna get higher, and
When I need the fire
You're always my lighter

When we're rolling
You always put your feet on mine, and
And when I’m running late
You always remind me of the time
When I'm feeling low
You lift me to the moon and back
Back into your arms, I won't let go
Until I know how much you really love me, baby

I see a light

And I've heard we never truly see ourselves
You gotta leave it up to someone else
To know how beautiful you really are, baby
We never get to see ourselves
Sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love
We never see us cry, when someone dies, see us cryin
Someone new was born, baby

When we're driving
You say you can go faster, and
When we're singing to the radio
You say you turn make it louder

And you roll another one
You wanna get higher, and
When I need the fire
You're always my lighter

I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly
At the same time, I think it represents
What's going on in my mind, when
We're together, everything is so sweet
There’s nowhere in the world I’d rather be
As long as I’ve got you, and you’ve got me, baby
I could leave you, I don’t need nothing but you
When you’re starting out beyond just us two
Forever gets complicated
It don’t have to be that way, baby

I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly
At the same time, I think it represents
What's going on in my mind [x8]
