When you wake in the morning and I can tell it’s not your best side
No good morning today
I stay to the right if I know you’re mad and on the left side
Stay out of your way

Just hold on
In a minute it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you hot
See I know, I know
‘Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

Ooh, ooh
I’m rootin' for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Yeah

If you were here
I’d get you a beer and I would hang your coat
You wanna behold
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
This is a long road, so much more to go

Just hold on
In a minute it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you hot
See I know, I know
‘Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

Ooh, ooh
I’m rootin' for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Yeah

See I’ve been dreamcatchin'
I caught that this is everlasting
Life filled with you, me, love and laughter
Happily ever after

So hold on
In a minute it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you hot
See I know, I know
‘Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

Ooh, ooh
I’m rootin' for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Yeah

I’m rootin' for you, baby
Yeah
I’m rootin' for my baby
Yeah
But you go through a lot
The pressure makes you hot
You still know what you got
Yeah
