[Miley Cyrus]
For those who don't know me,
I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day
'Cause I'm hot like that

Every guy, everywhere
just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten,
'Cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money
flyin' out the hands (oh)
They try to change me
but they realize they can't (No way)
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be can't I can't be tamed

If there was a question about my intentions,
I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya
Or tell you to go to hell
(I'm not a brat like that)
I'm like a puzzle
but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this,
we can make some magic,
I'm wrong like that

I wanna fly,
I wanna drive,
I wanna go (Lets go)
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be can't I can't be tamed

Well I'm not a trick you play,
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake,
I'm not a fake,
It's set in my DNA
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

[Lil' Jon]
Dang it you 
can't stop me you 
can't hold me you 
can't have me
you'll me amaze 
I like to party I'm not a baby
I get crazy you can't control me

[Miley Cyrus]
I wanna fly,
I wanna drive,
I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be can't I can't be tamed (you should know)
I can't be be be be 
(Never be tamed)

[Lil' Jon]

[Miley Cyrus]
