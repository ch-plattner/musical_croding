Try it with me, here we go.

1-2-3 everybody come on off your seats,
I'm gonna tell you bout a beat,
That's gonna make you move your feet.

I'll give the barbecue,
Show and tell your how to move,
If you're 5 or 82,
This is something you can do.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky,
And move side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.
Zig-zag, across the floor
Shuffle in diagonal,
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.
One-footed, 180 twist.
Then a zig-zag, step slide
Lean it left, clap 3 times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) [x3]

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

We get to 4, 5, 6
And you're feeling busted,
But it's not time to quit,
Practice makes you perfect.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky,
And move it side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.
Zig-zag, cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal,
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.
One-footed, 180 twist.
Then a zig-zag, step slide
Lean it left, clap 3 times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) [x3]

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Boom de clap de clap,
Boom-boom clap.
Come on, here we go.
Boom-Boom clap,
Boom de clap de clap.
Boom-Boom clap,
Boom de clap.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky,
And move it side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.

Shuffle in diagonal,
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.
One-footed, 180 twist.
