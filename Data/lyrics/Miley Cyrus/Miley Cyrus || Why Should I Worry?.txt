[Verse 1]
One minute I'm in Central Park.
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street.
Said, from the Bow'ry to St Mark's.
There's a syncopated beat. Right.

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetwise.
I can improvise.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetsmart.
I've got New York City heart.

[Chorus]
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime.
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just be-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

[Verse 2]
The rhythm of the city.
But once you get it down.
Said, then you can own this town.
You can wear the crown!

[Chorus]
Why should I worry? Tell me.
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-wopulation.
And I got street savoir faire.

[Bridge]
Ev'rything goes.
Ev'rything fits.
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz!

[Chorus]
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line.
I got street savoir faire.

[Fading]
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
