
Why do I just lie awake and think of you?
I need some sleep.
Tomorrow I have things to do.
Everytime I close my eyes I see your face,
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place.

[Chorus]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you.
But I do all the time.
I do all the time.

I just had to call you up and say hello.
I know it's 3 AM.
And I saw you awhile ago.
But I still have this aching pain to hear your voice
To know your there
I don't seem to have any choice.

[Chorus]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you.
But I do all the time.
I do all the time.

Oh yeah.
I'm so sorry I just had to wake you up.
I feel so lonely by myself.
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?
Or is this something else?
Yeah.

Yeeah.

[Chorus]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you.
But I do all the time.
I do all the time.

Oooh yeah
But I do all the time, I want you all the time.
Am I obsessed with you?
