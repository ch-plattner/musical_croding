[Miley]
Nobody listens to me, don't hear a single thing I've said
Say anything to soothe me, anything to get you from my head
Don't know how really I feel,
Cause it's the faith that makes it like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts to turn around like you were never there
Like somehow you could be replaced and I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break!!

[Chorus - Miley & Travolta]
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again.
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, that you would come back to me my friend
And now I got you, but I thought I lost you!

[Travolta]
I felt so empty out there, and there were days I had my doubts
but I knew I'd find you somewhere
because I knew I couldn't live without you in my life for one more day
and I swore I'd never break a promise that we made

[Chorus - Miley & Travolta]
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again.
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, that you would come back to me, my friend
And now I got you, but I thought I lost you!

[Travolta]
I told myself I wouldn't sleep 'til I searched the world from sea to sea

[Miley]
I made a wish upon a star, I turned around and there you were

[Miley & Travolta]
And now here we are, are

[Miley]
here we are
I thought I lost you

[Travolta]
I thought I lost you too

[Miley]
I thought I lost you

[Travolta]
I thought I lost you

[Miley]
Yeah

[Chorus - Miley & Travolta]
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again.
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but I kept the moments that we were in
and I knew in my heart, that you would come back to me, my friend
And now I got you, I thought I lost you!

[Miley]
but I thought I lost you

[Travolta]
I thought I lost you too

[Both]
so glad I got you, got you

[Miley]
so glad I got you, yeah yeah
I thought I lost you

[Travolta]
I thought I lost you too
