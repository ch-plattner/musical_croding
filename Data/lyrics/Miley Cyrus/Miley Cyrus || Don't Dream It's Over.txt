[A:]
Hey, hey
There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] Don't dream it's over
[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] When the world comes in
[M:] They come, they come
[M & A:] To build a wall between us
[A:] And we know they won't win

[M:]
Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today 
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] Don't dream it's over
[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] When the world comes in
[M:] They come, they come
[M & A:] To build a wall between us
[A:] And we know they won't win

[M:] Are you a mouse or a bear? Or...
[A:] Um...
[M:] Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse bear thing I've ever seen. 
Get it! 
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
[A:] You're the cutest unicorn in the world

[M:] That's fine, we can just go to riff on it!
[A:] Fuck!
[M:] Sorry I was fuckin you up, 
I was riffin, sorry
I was flirting, sorry
SORRY, I was flirting, sorry,
Alright, anyway
[M & A:] Now I'm walkin again
[M:] Alright, sorry, I'll fuck off, sorry, here we go

[A:] Now I'm walking ahead
To the beat of a drum
[M:] And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
[A:] Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
[M:] Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] Don't dream it's over
[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] When the world comes in
[M:] They come, they come
[A:] To build a wall between us
[M & A:] And we know they won't win

[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] Dream
[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] World
[M:] You're an angel Ariana Grande
[M:] Hey now, hey 
[A:] Now
