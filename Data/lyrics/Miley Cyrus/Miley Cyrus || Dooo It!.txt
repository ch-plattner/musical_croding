Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck (do it), I ain't no hippy (ah)

Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy (do it)

(I understand) feel like I am one with the universe
(I understand) and all I need is right here
(I understand) feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

(I understand) why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the sky?
Why there is trees? (do it)
And what the fuck is love? (do it)
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?
(Yo, fuck, man)

Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

Yo, sing about love, love is what you need
Loving what you sing, and loving smoking weed
(Weed, weed, weed, weed)
Sing about peace, being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck, sing along with me

Yeah I smoke pot (smoke pot), yeah I love peace (love peace)
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy

(I understand) why there is a sky?
And why are bitches bored?
And why them motherfuckers
Putting bullets in their mouths
Violence is king
But peace is the way
Someday weâ€™re gonna see it
So here's what I'm saying

Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Peace mu'fuckers (do it)
So peace mu'fuckers (do it)
Why do they put the dick in the pussy?
Fuck you
