[Miley:]
Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
[Madonna:]
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm-hmm

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
[Miley:]
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

[Both:]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do (uh, yeah)
Tell me everything I'm not but
Please don't tell me to stop

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop (come on, people)
And we won't stop
'Cause we run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

[Madonna:]
(Come on!)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
[Miley:]
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
[Madonna:]
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell no"?
[Miley:]
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright

[Madonna:]
Tell me love isn't true...

[Miley:]
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
'Cause we run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
'Cause we run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Here we go

[Both:]
Please don't, please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Don't you
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop

(Don't you ever) Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Don't you
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop
Don't you ever!
