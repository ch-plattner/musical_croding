
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all 

So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin 
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 

He gets his courage from the can, 
It makes him feel like a man 
Because he's loving all the ladies 
But the ladies don't love him at all 

Cause when he's not drunk 
He's only stuck on himself 
And then he has the nerve 
To say he needs a decent girl 

Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else 
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all 

So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin 
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all 

All caught up in the trends 
Well the truth began to bend 
And the next thing you know man 
There just ain't no truth left at all 

Cause when the pretty girl walks 
She walks so proud 
And when the pretty girl laughs 
Oh man, she laughs so loud 

And if it ain't this then its that 
As a matter of fact 
She hasn't had a day to relax 
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly 

Well I'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here 

Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in 

Here comes another one, just like the other one 
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him 
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin 
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 
He knows he ain't loved at all
