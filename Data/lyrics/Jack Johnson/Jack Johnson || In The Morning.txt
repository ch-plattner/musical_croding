So much love 
The kids are laughing in their sleep 
Swimming through their dreams into the morning 
So peaceful all the stories that we're told 
Lead them through the night back from the shadows 
So much joy every little girl and boy 
Even better when they wake up tomorrow 
So much love 
In their little mistletee 
Gonna miss you till we meet again in the morning 
So much peace in their pitter-patter feet 
Any open eyes can see that minds are reaching 
So much joy 
I'm afraid to be swept away 
Upstream there's a spring that brings in the new day 

These are the gifts we keep 
And this is the morning that we breathe 
And then we see 
These moments are the only gifts we need 

And your crazy curly morning hair 
Your maka piapia stare 
Smiling down from the top of the stairs 
You're so sweet 
And your robot pictures spread around 
I swear your feet don't touch the ground 
Once it starts it don't slow down 
But I don't want it to 

And these are the gifts we keep 
And this is the morning that we breathe 
And then we see 
These moments are the only gifts we need
