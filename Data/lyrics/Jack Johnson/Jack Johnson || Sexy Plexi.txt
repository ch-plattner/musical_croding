Sexy sexy made up of plexi disasters 
Pushing and pulling conservative rolling 
Unlike plastic, easier to see through 
Just like glass with no ring 
Softer and sadder you sing 
Sexy sexy do your thing 
Learn to be shy and then you can sting 
Plexi, plexi bend don't shatter 
Once you're broken, shape won't matter 

You're breaking your mind 
By killing the time that kills you 
But you can't blame the time 
When its only in your mind 

Quickly quickly grow and then you'll know 
It is such and awkward show to see 
And everyone you wanted to know 
And everyone you wanted to meet 
Have all gone away 
Well they've all gone away 

And now you're 
Breaking your mind 
By killing the time that kills you 
But you cant blame the time 
When its only in your mind 

You're breaking your mind
