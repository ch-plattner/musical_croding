I've gotta get home
There's a garden to tend
All the fruit's on the ground
The birds have all moved back into my attic,
Whistled in static
The young learn to fly
I will patch up the holes once again

Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon.
Isn't soon.

And so I try to understand
What I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
'Cause this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon.
Home is wherever we are if there's love here too

In the back of my house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far
It grew back again
And now there's no trail at all
Only grass growing taller
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose 'cause I'll be damned if time don't win

I've gotta get home
There's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruit buried and began
Their own family trees teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

And so I try to understand
What I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
'Cause this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon.
Home is wherever we are if there's love here too

I said,
Home is wherever we are if there's love here too
Home is wherever we are if there's love here too
