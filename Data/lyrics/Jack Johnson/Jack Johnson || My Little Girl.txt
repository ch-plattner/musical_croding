
Hey, little girl
You might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to but
Hey, little girl
Maybe someday
At least that's what all the good people will say
Hey, little girl
Look what you've done

You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own

Hey, little girl
Black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song, I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes?
And tell you such big lies
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear
My little girl

You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own
