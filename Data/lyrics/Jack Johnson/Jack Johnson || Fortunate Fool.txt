She's got it all figured out 
She knows what everything's about 
And when anybody doubts her, 
Or sings songs without her 
She's just so mmm 

She knows the world is just her stage 
And so she'll never misbehave 
She gives thanks for what they gave her 
Man, they practically made her 
Into a mmm 

She's the one that stumbles when she talks about 
The seven foreign films that she's checked out 
Such a fortunate fool 
She's just too good to be true 
She's such a fortunate fool 
She's just so mmm 

She's got it all figured out 
She knows what everything's about 
And when anybody doubts her 
Or sings songs about her 
She's just so mmm 

She's the one that stumbles when she talks about it 
So maybe we shouldn't talk about 
Such a fortunate fool 
She's just too good to be true 
She's such a fortunate fool 
She's just so mmm
