I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back [x2]
Give it back...

I don't want you to know
Let's not go sleep tonight
It's not that it goes too fast
It's just that it goes at all

And it's time to turn your love
Give it back [x3]
Give it back...

Why should I be sad when I'm just you?
Why should I be sad? Baby, I'm with you [x2]
Baby, I'm with you...

And it's time to turn your love
Give it back [x3]
Give it back...

Give it back, give it back, give it back...
