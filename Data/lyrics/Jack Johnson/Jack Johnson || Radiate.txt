You walk into the world you make
You lose yourself but you find your way
I'm gonna watch you 
Radiate [4x]

We turn so slow I know it's hard to wait
Take your time, sun is yours to take
I'm gonna watch you
Radiate [4x]

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream

I see you lost in what you create
All of time in this one single day
You take it in and you
Radiate [4x]

Follow your hands as they build
As they shape, as they follow your mind
And rose like a wave
Take it and you radiate
Radiate, gonna watch you radiate, radiate

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream
