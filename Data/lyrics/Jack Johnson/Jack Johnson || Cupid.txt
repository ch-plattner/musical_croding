How many times must we go through this?
You've always been mine, woman i thought you knew this
How many times must we go through this?
You'll always be mine, Cupid only misses sometimes

But we could end up broken hearted
If we don't remember why this all started
And if they try to tell you love fades with time
Tell them there's no such thing as time
It's our time
