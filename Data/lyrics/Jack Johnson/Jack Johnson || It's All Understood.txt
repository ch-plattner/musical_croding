
Everyone laughed at her joke 
As if they'd never even heard it before 
And maybe they were truly amused 
But every word that she spoke was a bore 
And maybe it's because they had seen 
The previews on the TV screen 
Well this part is good and that's well understood 
So you should laugh if you know what I mean 

But it's all relative 
Even if you don't understand 
Well it's all understood 
Especially when you don't understand 
Then it's all just because 
Even if we don't understand 
Then lets all just believe 

Everyone knows what went down 
Because the news was spread all over town 
And fact is only what you believe 
And fact and fiction work as a team 
It's almost always fiction in the end 
That content begins to bend 
When context is never the same 

And it's all relative 
Even if we don't understand 
And that's well understood 
Especially when we don't understand 
Then it's all just because 
Even if we don't understand 
Then lets all just believe 

I was reading a book 
Or maybe it was a magazine 
Suggestions on where to place faith 
Suggestions on what to believe 
But I read somewhere 
That you've got to beware 
You can't believe anything you read 
But the good Book is good 
And that's well understood 
So don't even question 
If you know what I mean 

But it's all relative 
Even if you don't understand 
Well it's all understood 
Especially when you don't understand 
And it's all just because 
Even if we don't understand 
Then lets all just believe 

But there you go once again 
You missed the point and then you point 
Your fingers at me 
And say that I said not to believe 
I believe 
I guess 
I guess it's all relative
