
Everybody is made of clay
That's what they used to say
Until the truth stepped on us all
Now everything that was big is small
We're just little crying robots
Program me
I wanna win the race
I wanna find the place
Where the king
Locked up the princess
Jump the fence
And drink a little bit of...

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now who is the king of the sky
Jupiter says oh me oh my oh why
Is the game always changing
I've been through some strangeness
what's the matter
Is the feast not fat enough
Up the ladder with your feet
Reaching with your hands
You can feel it and dream it
I know you want to believe it
Just steal it
Take a piece of the sun
And drink some...

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now everybody's in the play
At least that's what the script
Told me to say
It said:
Shadows cut across the hero's face
He falls from grace
Until a little bird sang:
The truth is never ending
We're just here pretending
Let's all laugh so that we don't cry
Let's all lift our glasses up to the sky
For some...

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology
