After all this time
After all of these season
After your own decision to go to the water for a reason
It's only the ocean and you
And all of this lines
Will all be erased soon
They go out with the tide
And come back with the waves
It's only the ocean and you

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in

And this work is done
And this cold is dry
When this world's too much
It will be only the ocean and me
When these sails go up
Mountanis fade away
Stars come back
I'm finally free
It's only the ocean and me

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
And you pull me in

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love but you don't hate
You just roll right over me
And you pull me in

And you pull me in...

You just roll over me
And you pull me in
