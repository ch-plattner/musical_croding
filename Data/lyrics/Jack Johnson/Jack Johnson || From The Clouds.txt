
Oh, you're such a pretty thing, I'll take you and I'll make you all mine.

I will steal you from this patient world let it chase us, it could never take you back.

[Chorus]
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.
It's not ours.

And I know you know me well enough to know I'm lucky to have you.
But all this just the little things, the words that I should tell you all the time.
You're so sweet to me when you beat me in doubles solitaire.
You're so sweet to me in a world that's not always fair.

[Chorus]
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.

More love that you feel
More your little heart will ache.
Love's the only thing that carries on
It's the only thing this world can't take.
This love is ours.
This love is ours.
This love is oooohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh.
This love is oooohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh.

Oh you're such a pretty thing, I'll take you and I'll make you all mine.
