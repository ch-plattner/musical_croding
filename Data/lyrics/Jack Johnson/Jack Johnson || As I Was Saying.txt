
As I was saying
Just before you left the room
Before I assumed
That you might not come around

As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
Because the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up
Then subtract my lack of sleep

My mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them
Or only let them be?

I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Or does it even matter at all?
Because even if this story should fall
From the sky to the sea
If I should fall
Would you fall down with me?
Would you fall?

Found my foundation
It was underneath me all along
On this path I'm on
Now I never walk alone

I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist
Might find his way back home

I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you
Not from here or now or you
