I feel sorrow for the fear
And everything it brings
Wonder if it will ever sleep
I know you understand
Because you briefly look away
Focusing on nothing 
So now everything is clear
Cause there's noone to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind

And I saw you - in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You told me time - never waits
What is that supposed to mean?

All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
and take them from our eyes
And make them into monsoons

And turn them into mon -
Sooner or later they'll weave their way back to the sea
Gonna finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always do, all into time
Because time never waits

Daddy don't day dream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime
Sonny, do you hear the sound?
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone
How else can I explain?
Because it's only the pain
It's coming straight through
Come into a mind

Cross cut to you - in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You tell me that time - never waits
That's ok cause I don't wait for time

When all of life 
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides, it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And turn them into monsoons

Make them into mon -
Sooner or later they'll weave their way back to the sea
Gonna finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always break all in due time
Cause time never waits
