
In the morning when the world came awake
Before you knew me I knew your name
It was painted across the day as it breaks
An impression in your window frame

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the garden
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

But one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me washing dishes
Singing from the bottom
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been in the ashes
Singing from the garden

Where everything reaches for the sun
Still unsure of what we'll become
But I need you to reach out to me
See in me more than I could see
Because I'm afraid that

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now
Right now

You see one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the bottom
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now
