Well your mama made your pretty
And your mama made you sweet
Your daddy gave you daydreams
And more cushion in your seat
Your mama gave you those windows
To your beautiful soul
Your daddy got more love for you
Then you could ever know

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do

Well your mama made a promise
That your daddy's gonna keep
Forever's how long
Your mama's going to love your
Daddy made you messy
And your mama made you neat
Forever's how long your daddy's gonna love your
Mama made a clone
So she won't be alone
When the boys and me are getting
So out of control

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do

When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's gonna dry your eyes
When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's gonna dry your eyes
And your daddy's sure gonna try
But only mama's gonna dry your eyes
But your daddy's sure gonna try
