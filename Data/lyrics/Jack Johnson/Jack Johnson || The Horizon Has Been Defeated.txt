The horizon has been defeated 
by the pirates of the new age 
alien casinos 
well maybe it's just time to say 
things can go bad 
and make you want to run away 
but as we grow older 
the troubles just seems to stay 

future complications
in the strings between the cans 
but no prints can come from fingers 
if machines become our hands 
and then our feet become the wheels 
and then the wheels become the cars 
and then the rigs begin to drill 
until the drilling goes too far 

things can go bad 
and make you want to run away 
but as we grow older 
the horizon begins to fade away 

thingamajigsaw puzzled
anger don't you step too close
because people are lonely and only
animals with fancy shoes
hallelujah zig zag nothing
misery it's on the loose
because people are lonely and only
animals with too many tools 
that can build all the junk that we sell
sometimes it makes you want to yell

things can go bad 
and make you want to run away 
but as we grow older 
the horizon begins to fade away
