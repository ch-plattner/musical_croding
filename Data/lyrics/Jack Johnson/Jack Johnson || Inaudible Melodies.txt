
Brushfire fairytales 
Itsy bitsy diamond wells 
Big fat hurricanes 
Yellow bellied given names 
Well shortcuts can slow you down 
And in the end we're bound 
To rebound off of we 

Well dust off your thinking caps 
Solar powered plastic plants 
Pretty pictures of things we ate 
We are only what we hate 
But in the long run we have found 
Silent films are full of sound 
Inaudibly free 

Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 

Inaudible melodies 
Serve narrational strategies 
Unobtrusive tones 
Help to notice nothing but the zone 
Of visual relevancy 
Frame-lines tell me what to see 
Chopping like an axe 

Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax 

Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 

Well Plato's cave is full of freaks 
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen 
I wish they could believe 
In all the things that never made the screen 
And just slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 
Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 
Moving Too....
