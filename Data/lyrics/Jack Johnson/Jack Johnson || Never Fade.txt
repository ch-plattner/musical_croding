When all I want is you

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

When I first saw you come across the room
And then you saw me, then I knew what to do
I tried to play it cool and attached no strings
But by the end oft he day, I needed the whole thing

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

You see I knew right then, that this could last so long
I went home that night, I wrote my first lovesong
And as the days went by, I knew I had it made
Well you could try to pretend, your smile gave it away

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

And It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

And now here we are, how could we ever know
I knew I loved you then and I've watched you grow
So it came to be, that I raised you and you raised me
Were lucky that way, cause our love can never fade

No our love can never fade yeah
Our love will never fade yeah
Our love can never fade yeah

It feels good to be the one that you want,
When all I want is you, can never fade yeah
[x2]

When all I want is you, can never fade
All I want is you, can never fade

When all I want is you
