
Saturday morning and it's time to go 
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well... 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Sunday morning and it's time to go 
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
We're talking kinda funny from helium 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Monday morning and it's time to go 
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
Meet her by the sugar mill after school 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would 
Everything good always would remain
