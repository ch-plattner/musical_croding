Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures

I pictured us at the end of time
Holding up a camera to our eyes
I took a picture of you took a picture of me
In the back ground of the picture
Was water running to the sea

So I pictured us standing there
Staying away from time
Watching it like a river
As it slowly washes by

And now
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures
And now
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures

The feed back loop
Is closing in so tight
Surrounding ourselves
With satellites

But I picture us standing there
Staying away from time
Just watching it like a river
As it slowly washes by

And now
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures.........
I pictured us at the end of time
Taking pictures of nothing
