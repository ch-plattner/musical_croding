
I got a faulty parachute 
I got a stranger's friend 
An exciting change in 
My butchers blend 
A symbol on the ceiling 
With the flick of a switch 
My new found hero 
In the enemy's ditching 

Well somebody's something was left in the room 
And man, now that its gone well of course we assume 
That somebody else needed something so bad 
That they took everything that somebody had 

Losing hope is easy 
When your only friend is gone 
And every time you look around 
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 

The mark was left 
Man it's never the same 
Next time that you shoot 
Make sure that you aim 
Open windows with passing cars 
A brand new night 
With the same old stars 

Losing hope is easy 
When your only friend is gone 
And every time you look around 
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 

Feed the fool 
A piece of the pie 
Make a fool of his system 
Make a fool of his mind 
Give him bottles of lies 
And maybe he'll find 
His place in heaven 
Cause he might just die 

Losing hope is easy 
When your only friend is gone 
And every time you look around 
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 
But hanging on is easy 
When you've got a friend to call 
When nothings making sense at all 
You're not the only one that's afraid of change
