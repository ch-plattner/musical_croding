Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you

We went walking through the hills
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hail storm came and yelled
“You need to let go, you've got no control. No”

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you

This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I've got you

And when tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I got you

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you
