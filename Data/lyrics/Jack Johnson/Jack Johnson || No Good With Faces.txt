No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Street lamps are broken
Black the way I came
Who broke the moonlight
Watch it wax and wane
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain
Its our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
Its not only you
You're looking at now
Road signs were stolen
Left here holding this flame
Who stole my patience
Who stole my way
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain
Its our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
Its not only you
You're looking at now
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain
Its our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
Its not only you
You're looking at now
Who you looking at now
Who you looking at now
No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
