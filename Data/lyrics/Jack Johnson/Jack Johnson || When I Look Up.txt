
When I look up at the stars
As I walk in the night
Down the street by my house
It feels good

When I look up at the stars
As I walk in the night
Down the street by my house
It feels good

The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So it falls behind spaces
And hides behind clouds

When I look up at the clouds
As they move through the night
With the wind
As I walk down the street

The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So I step on the shadows
Of my own feet
