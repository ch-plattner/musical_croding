
There must be a forecast that you won't let yourself see,
So you keep watchin' as you're driftin', sail away from what you need.
Why don't I just give you everything you'll take from me?
Cuz' nobody owns anything and everyone is free.

And that's why this ship is goin' down,
Desperately, I need a sound.
A song to sing so we can carry on.
Just let it be sung so we can carry on...

God fearing people at the bottom of the sea,
Walkin' without lanterns, let a stone skip over thee.
Hi-ho away as in the sea,
Hi-ho be gone,
So let's just dance,
We'll waltz above the ocean. 

this ship is goin' down,
Desperately, I need a sound.
A song to sing so we can carry on.
Just let it be sung so we might carry on...
Let it be sung so we...
Let it be sung so we could carry on.

I've heard all of the stories and in them I've put my trust,
You've gotta touch the bottom before you can come back up.
And I know what you're heart is tellin' you...
Cuz' my heart's tellin' me the same thing too:

This ship is goin' down,
Desperately, I need a sound.
A song to sing so we can carry on.
Just let it be sung so we might carry on...
Let it be sung so we...
Let it be sung so we could carry on.
