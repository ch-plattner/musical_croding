
Drink the water drink it down 
This time I know I'm bound 
To spit it back up 
I didn't want this 
Salty substitute, just not going to do 
I need some air, if I'm going to live through 
This experience reminds me of a clock 
That just won't tick 

I want to wake up 
>From this concussion 
But my dream is just not done 
I'm late again, 
It's just one of those 
Bad days look outside and 
Be careful what you ride 
You just might find 
That you're out of time 
To swim ashore 
If I drift long enough 
I'll be home 

He's got delusions between his ears 
Man it takes up too much space 
And all that tension between his gears man 
He'll never ever leave this place 
He's got stones instead of bones 
And everybody knows 
That can make you real real slow 
And if heaven was below 
He'd know just where to go 
Dive in the ocean 
And he'd sink like a stone 
And he'd say 
It's time to swim ashore 
If I drift long enough 
I'll be home 

Hold on if you can 
You're gonna sink faster 
Than you can imagine so hold 
Hold on if you can 
You're gonna sink faster 
Than you can imagine so hold 

It's just time to swim ashore 
If I drift long enough 
I'll be home
