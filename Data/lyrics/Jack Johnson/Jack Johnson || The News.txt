
A billion people died on the news tonight 
But not so many cried at the terrible sight 
Well mama said 
It's just make believe 
You can't believe everything you see 
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies 
On the news tonight 

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright 
To put the music behind the news tonight 
Well mama said 
You can't believe everything you hear 
The diagetic world is so unclear 
So baby close your ears 
On the news tonight 
On the news tonight 

The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight 
And mama said 

Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die? 
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes 
Mama said 
It's just make believe 
You cant believe everything you see 
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies 
On the news tonight
