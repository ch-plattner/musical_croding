Are they laughing at or with me?
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a bitter you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

People are just trying to fit in
But is this something telling you?
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't wanna see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high score
No dancing shoes have touched this dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [4x]
