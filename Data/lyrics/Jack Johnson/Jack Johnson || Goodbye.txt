
This is a true story.....

I think it was a sign
When your cell 
Phone fell
Into the toilet
And then it spelled 
The word
Goodbye

Backstage at the shell
It was nice enough of it to tell 
You farewell
Before
It went 
Off to Hell

Well maybe it will see 
Our two computers
Down there
That were stolen
On New Years Day
I never really liked them
Anyway
