All I need is a little sun
Some for me some for everyone
All I need is a little air
Some for me some for everywhere
Little bit of love
Little bit of love

And all I need is some water to drink
Quite place so I can sit and think
And I find me a pot of gold
I'll never forget about the rain (bow)
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love

Really what I'm trying to say
Is I need you
And every little bit of love
You give me too

And all I need is a happy home
Some place I wouldn't have to be alone
It'll be nice to have some candle light
Light the fire in your heart at night
Little bit of love
Not that we need it
Little bit of love
No need be greedy
Little bit of love
Cuz I love this tready
Little bit of love
Not that we need it

Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Every little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
(we did six times)
(its good, that sounds just cool)
