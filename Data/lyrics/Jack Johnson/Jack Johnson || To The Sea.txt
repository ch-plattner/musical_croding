
Bring on your hunters
Let them bring their dogs
It's me that you wanted
I've been right here all along
Right here all along
You better bring your buckets
We've got some dreams to drain
I'll be at the bottom
I've been right here waiting so long
Just waiting so long
Dreams to drain
Put them in a cage
Unlock the pain
And I'll be here waiting
You fell asleep with the key
All your walls
Mean nothing to me
I know you'll come back
To set us free
Run my dear son
Until we get to the trees
And then keep on going all the way
We've got to get right down to the sea
We've got to get to the sea
Oh my dear son
We've got to get to the sea
But don't you touch the water
Don't you barely breathe
And if you see yourself
Looking back at you
You're going to have to leave
You're going to have to leave
I don't want you to go
But you've got to leave
Dreams to drain
Put them in a cage
Unlock the pain
And I'll be here waiting
You fell asleep with the key
All your walls
Mean nothing to me
I know you'll come back
You're going to set us free
I don't want you to go
But you've got to leave
You can always come to me
I'll give you what you need
Run my dear son
We've got to get to the sea
