I know she said it's alright 
But you can make it up next time 
I know she knows it's not right 
There ain't no use in lying 
Maybe she thinks I know something 
Maybe maybe she thinks its fine 
Maybe she knows something I don't 
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying 

It seems to me that maybe, 
It pretty much always means no 
So don't tell me you might just let it go 
And often times we're lazy 
It seems to stand in my way 
Cause no one no not no one 
Likes to be let down 

I know she loves the sunrise 
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes 
And I know that when she said she's gonna try 
Well it might not work because of other ties and 
I know she usually has some other ties 
And I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em 
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but 
Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie too 

It seems to me that maybe 
It pretty much always means no 
So don't tell me you might just let it go 
And often times we're lazy 
It seems to stand in my way 
Cause no one no not no one 
Likes to be let down 
It seems to me that maybe 
It pretty much always means no 
So don't tell me you might just let it go 

The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall 
Even with all the money in the whole wide world 
Please please please don't pass me 
Please please please don't pass me 
Please please please don't pass me by 

Everything you know about me now baby you gonna have to change 
You gonna have to call it by a brand new name 
Please please please don't drag me 
Please please please don't drag me 
Please please please don't drag me down 

Just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move 
Even after all the silly things you do 
Please please please don't drag me 
Please please please don't drag me 
Please please please don't drag me down
