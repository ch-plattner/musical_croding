
The air was more than humid
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes

The bulls were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children were playing cricket with no shoes

The next morning we woke up, man, with a seven hour drive
Well there we were stuck in port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving soundly engine running smooth

Officials were quite friendly
Once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving soundly engine running smooth

The next morning we woke up, man, with the sunrise to the right
Moving back north to port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm
Yes and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm
