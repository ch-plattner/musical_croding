
Well he's not necessarily trying to say that he minds it 
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid 
Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted 
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid 
And certain situations scream for deviations 
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle 
Of this and that and man he should try less 
Because every time he's rejected man he loses affection 

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time 
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused 
What a terrible thing for you to do 
What an awful thing for you to say 
What a terrible thing for you to relay 

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing 
But still find some to spare 
And other people got more than they could use 
But they don't share 
And some people got problems man 
They got awful complications 
Other people got perfect situations 
With no provocation 

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time 
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused 
What a terrible thing for you to do 
What an awful thing for you to say 
What a terrible thing for you 
Confused 
What a terrible thing for you to do 
What an awful thing for you to say 
What a terrible thing for you to relay 

Somehow we always get stuck in the middle 
Confused, what an awful thing for you to do 
Confused, what an awful thing for you to say
