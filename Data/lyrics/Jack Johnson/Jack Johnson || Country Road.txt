
Head on Collision on a 2 lane country road,
Lord I pray let them be safe.
No turning back I'm just a mile away from home,
I sit here waiting let me be patient.

Sometimes it's hard to ease my mind to realize,
you're always with me waiting, willing
to hear my, thoughts my hopes,
my dreams, my every need

I pray for wisdom and overstanding

What's meant to be will always be though I control my destiny,
Free will you gave me even though you made me.
Be careful of the things you do it eventually comes back to you,
universal law, Babylon shall fall.

I pray for peace in times of war

Destruction of Civilizations past is consequence of forests thrashed,
the air you breathe comes directly from trees,
What goes up must come back down,
what goes around comes back around,
the things you do shall be done unto you.

I pray for light in times of darkness
