Sun is shining, the weather is sweet, yeah
Make you wanna move your dancing feet now
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, y'all, can you understand?

When the mornin' gather the rainbow, yeah, yeah
Want you to know, I'm a rainbow too now
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, y'all, can you, can you, can you understand?

Sun is shining, the weather is sweet now
Make you wanna move your dancing feet, yeah
But to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can, here I stand, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Can you understand me now, baby?
Do you believe me?
