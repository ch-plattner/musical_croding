Give thanks and praises to the Most-I (Jah!);
Give thanks and praises so high (so high).

He will only lead us again (again):
Oh, take that veil from off of your eyes;
Look into the future of realize.

And in Ham is known to be the Prophet.
Glory to Jah, the Prophet is come (through all these ages);
Glory to Jah, the Prophet has come (through all these stages).
When my soul was hurtin' deep within,
And I'm worrying to be free, desperately, yeah.
So guide and protect I'n'I, O Jah - Jah,
Through all these ages;
Guide and protect I'n'I, O Jah - Jah,
Through all these stages.

Rastafari is his Name (Jah!) -
Rastafari is his Name (Jah!).
If Jah didn't love I (love I),
If I didn't love I (love I),
If Jah didn't love I (love I),
If I didn't love I,
Would I be around today?
Would I be around to say:

Give thanks and praises, give thanks and praises;
Give thanks and praises, give thanks and praises;
Give thanks and praises, give thanks and praises. [fadeout]
