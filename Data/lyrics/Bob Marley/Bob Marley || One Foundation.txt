Got to build our love on one foundation;
Got to build our love on one foundation.

There will never be - yeah! - no love at all;
There will never be no love at all.

Got to put aside them segregation, yeah!
Got to put aside them organization;
Got to put aside them denomination.
There will - there will never be no love at all;

(Got to build our love) So build our love
(on one foundation) On one foundation;
(Got to build our love) Come, let us build our love
(on one foundation) On one solid foundation.
(Got to build our love) Got to build our love
(on one) on one foundation (foundation),
Or there will never be a single drop of love;

Got to come together
We are birds of a feather;
We got to come together
'Cause we are birds of a feather;
Got to come together
'Cause we are birds of a feather;
Or there will never be (Lord, have mercy!) no love at all -
There will never be - yeah, yeah! - no love at all.

We also got to realize we are one people, yeah!
Got to realize that we are one people, yeah!
We got to realize we are one people,
Or there will never be no love at all -
There will never, never, never be no love at all.

Got to build our love on one foundation;
Got to build our love on one foundation;
Got to build our love on one foundation;
Got to build our love on one foundation;
Got to build our love on one foundation ... [fadeout]
