A Dreadlock Congo I!
Woy-a, Natty Congo:
A Blackman Redemption! Woy-yo, yo-oo-wo-oo!
A Blackman Redemption! Woy-yo, wo-oo-wo-oo!

No need - no need to get jumpy;
No need and-a no need to get bumpy,
And-a no need - and-a no need to get bumpy;
No nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-need to get jumpy!

Youth and youth agree to:
Cool runnings; can you dig it?
Cool runnings; yeah, one more time! A-beg ya:
Cool runnings; can you stop it?
Cool runnings:
Spread out, spread out,
Spread out, spread out.

Tell you about the Blackman Redemption; can you dig it? (Oh, yeah!)
A Blackman Redemption; can you stop it?
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

Coming from the root of King David
Through to the line of Solomon,
His Imperial Majesty is the Power of Authority:
Spread out, spread out,
Spread out, spread out,
Spread out, spread out,
Spread, spread out.

[Instrumental break]

No need - no need - no need to get jumpy,
And-a no need - and-a no need to walk away.

Let me tell bout ya:
Cool runnings, can you dig it?
Cool runnings: it's one more time we want it;
Cool runnings;
Cool runnings;
Spread out, spread out,
Spread out, spread out,
Spread out. Spread out, spread out.
Spread out, spread out.

It's just-a Blackman Redemption
Can you dig it (wo-yeah!) Good, Lord! Good, Lord! Good, Lord!
Blackman Redemption, can you stop it? Oh, no! Oh, no!
Blackman redemption - [fadeout]
