
What your hands do,
It's your own eyes that've seen.
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean?

It's your own conscience
That is gonna remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is gonna judge.

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on. (Pass it on, children)
Help your brothers (help them) in their needs:
Pass it on.

Live for yourself and you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.

In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on.

What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light.
We're not here to judge what's good from bad
But to do the things that are right.

On a hot, sunny day,
Follow the shadows for rescue.
But as the day grows old,
I know the sun is gonna find you.

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on.
Help your brothers in their needs:
Pass it on.

Live for yourself, you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.

In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on. (Pass it on)
