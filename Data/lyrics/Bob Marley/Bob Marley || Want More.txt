Do you want more? (want more)
Now you get what you want,
Do you want more? (want more)

You think it's the end,
But it's just the beginning.
You think it's the end,
But it's just the beginning.
Go down back-biter, down back-bite; down back-biter, down back-bite!
Down back-biter, down back-biter; down back-biter, down back-bite!

They stab you in the back
And they claim that you're not looking.
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision.
They stab you in the back
And they claim that you're not looking.
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision -
In the valley of decision.
Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite!

Now you get, what you want,
Do you want more?
Now you get, what you want,
Do you want more?
Now you get, what you want,
Do you want more?
You think it's the end:
Do you want more?

Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite!
Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite!

They stab you in the back
And they claim that you're not looking.
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision.
Now: what you want?
Want more? Want more?
Now: what you get?
Want more? Want more?
Now - Now: do you want more?
You think it's the end: (think it's the end)
Do you want more? (want more) (you think it's the end)

(Now: what you want?
Want more? Want more?
Now: what you get?
Want more? Want more?)
