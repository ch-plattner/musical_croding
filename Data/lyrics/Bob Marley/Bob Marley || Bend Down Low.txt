Bend down low, let me tell you what I know now;
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know.
Oh! Fisherman row to reap what you sow now;
Oh, tell you all I know (Oo-oh!),
you've got to let me go now (Oo-oh!),
And all you've got to do:
(Bend down low) Oh yeah! Let me tell you what I know;
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know. Oh yeah!

You keep on knockin', but you can't come in.
I get to understand you been livin' in sin,
But if you love me, woman, walk right in.
I've got a notch for your safety-pin,
But bend down low.

Keep on knockin', but you can't come in.
I get to understand you been livin' in sin,
But walk right in, woman, sit right down.
I will keep on lovin' you; I play the clown.
But bend down low, baby, let me tell you what I know;
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know, yeah!
Let me tell you, baby! Let me tell ya -
Knock on, babe! Just won't let ya in!
You been livin' in sin. Knock on! [fadeout]
