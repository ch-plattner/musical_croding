They say the sun an-a shines for all,
But-a yin some people world, it never shine at all. Mm-mm-mm.
They say love is a stream that will find its course;
I mean - some-a people think life is a dream
So they making matters worse.

But no matter what the crisis is;
No matter what the crisis is:
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' your thing!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Givin' it, givin' it, givin' it, givin' it!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

So - so - so much have been said, so little (been done) been done
They still killin' - killin' the people
And they - and they havin' (havin' their fun) - havin'-a - havin'-a lots of fun -
Killin' the people, oo-yoo! - (havin' fun) havin' their fun!
They just want to be the leader
In the 'ouse of the risin' sun.

But no matter what the crisis is;
Oh, no, oh, no no - no what the crisis is:
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

[Instrumental break]

They say the sun-un-un-un shines for all,
But-a yin some people world, it never shine at all!
They say love is a stream,
That will find its course, and every river runs to sea;
Some people still think life is a dream,
So they - so they makin' - makin' it worse.

No matter what the crisis is;
No matter what the crisis is:
Do it: live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
His mercies endureth for ever, yeah!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Oh, children, come on, and give Jah -
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Children, come on, and give Jah -
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!) [fadeout]
