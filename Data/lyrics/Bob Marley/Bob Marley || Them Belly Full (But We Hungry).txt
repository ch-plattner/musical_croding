Them belly full, but we hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A yot a-yook, but d' yood no 'nough.

You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance;
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh!

Forget your troubles and dance!
Forget your sorrows and dance!
Forget your sickness and dance!
Forget your weakness and dance!

Cost of livin' gets so high,
Rich and poor they start to cry:
Now the weak must get strong;
They say, "Oh, what a tribulation!"
Them belly full, but we hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-yook, but d' yood* no 'nough.

We're gonna chuck to Jah music - chuckin';
We're chuckin' to Jah music - we're chuckin'.

A belly full, but them hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but d' food* no 'nough.
A hungry man is a angry man;
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-yook, but you no 'nough'
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough.
A pot a-cook, but you no 'nough;
A hungry mob is a angry mob;
A hungry mob is a angry mob. /fadeout/

[*Sheet music gives this line as: "A pot a cook but you no' nough".]
