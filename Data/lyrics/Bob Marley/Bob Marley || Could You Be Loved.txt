Could you be love and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya,
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own,
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone,
I am the darkness there must come out the light.

Could you be love and be loved?
Could you be love, wo now! - and be loved?

(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too,
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman!
(Could you be - could you be - could you be love?
Could you be - could you be love?
Could you be - could you be - could you be love?
Could you be - could you be love?)

Don't let them change ya, oh! -
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!
We've got a life to live.
They say: only - only -
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive -
Stay alive! Eh!

Could you be love and be loved?
Could you be love, wo now! - and be loved?

(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry;
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied.)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?
Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! Say something!
(Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! Say something! (Say something!)
Say something! Say something! (Could you be love?)
Say something! Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Uh!
Say something! Come on!
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?) [fadeout]
