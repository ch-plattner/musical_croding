
You a-go tired fe see me face;
Can't get me out of the race.
Oh, man, you said I'm in your place
And then you draw bad cyard -
A-make you draw bad cyard,
And then you draw bad cyard.

Propaganda spreading over my name;
Say you wanna bring another life to shame.
Oh, man, you just a-playing a game
And then you draw bad cyard (draw bad cyard);
A-make you draw bad cyard (draw bad cyard);
A-make you draw bad cyard.

I want to disturb my neighbour,
'Cause I'm feelin' so right;
I want to turn up my disco,
Blow them to full watts tonight, eh! -
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style,
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style.

'Cause we guarding the palace so majestic;
Guarding the palace so realistic!

Them a-go tired to see we face (oh yeah!),
Me say them can't get we out of the race;
Oh, man, it's just a big disgrace.
The way you draw bad cyard (draw bad cyard);
The way you make wrong moves (make wrong moves);
The way you draw bad cyard (draw bad cyard);
A-make you draw bad cyard (draw bad cyard);
A-make you draw bad cyard -
In a rub-a-dub style, rub-a-dub style,
In a rub-a-dub style - [fadeout]
