Come we go burn down Babylon one more time
(Come we go burn down Babylon one more time);
Come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon);
For them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
Them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
So come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon)!

Men see their dreams and aspiration-a
Crumble in front of their face,
And all of their wicked intention
To destroy the human race.

And how I know - and how I know - and that's how I know:
A Reggae Music, mek we chant down Babylon;
With music, mek we chant down Babylon;
This music, mek we chant down Babylon;
This music, come we chant down Babylon.

Come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon one more time);
Come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon);
For them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
Them soft! Me say, Them soft! (ah-yoy!)
So come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon)!

Me say, Music you're - music you're the key,
Talk to who? Please talk to me,
Bring the voice of - of the Rastaman,
Communicating to - 'cating to everyone.

How I (know) - how I know, how I (know) - how I know -
And that's how I know:
A Reggae Music, chant down - chant down - chant down Babylon,
Chant down Babylon, chant down Babylon,
Chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music! (chant down Babylon) [fadeout]
