
Wo, man, deh you are!

When the race gets hard to run,
It means you just can't take the pace.
When it's time to have your fun,
You find the tears run on down through your face,
Then you stop and think a little:
Are you the victim of the system?
Anyday now they gon' let you down;
Remember, Natty will be there
To see you through.

(I) And ain't it good to know (know) now:
Jah will be waiting there.
(I) Ain't it doggone good to know (know) , you all;
Jah will be waiting there.
Wait in Summer, wait in Spring,
Wait in Autumn, Winter thing,
(Tribe) goes up, all the tribe goes down:
Bring my children from the end of d'earth

Many a time I sit and wonder why
This race so - so very hard to run,
Then I say to my soul: take courage,
Battle to be won,
Like a ship that's tossed and driven,
Battered by the angry sea, yea-eah!
Say the tide of time was raging;
Don't let the fury fall on me, no, no!

(I) 'Cause I know (know) -know:
Jah will be waiting there;
(I) Ain't it good to know (know) now:
Jah will be waiting there. Wo-oo-o-oo-o! Ooh, yeah!
Lost and found, who speak I give;
Lost and found, who speak I give;
Speak I give, lost and found.
Lost and found, who speak I give;
Lost and found, who speak I give.
