Zion train is coming our way;
The Zion train is coming our way;
Oh, people, get on board! (you better get on board!)
Thank the Lord (praise Fari) -
I gotta catch a train, 'cause there is no other station;
Then you going in the same direction (ooh-ooh).

Zion's train is coming our way;
The Zion's train is coming our way.

Which man can save his brother's soul? (save your brother's soul)
Oh man, it's just self control. (oo-hoo-oo!)
Don't gain the world and lose your soul (just don't lose your soul)
Wisdom is better than silver and gold -
To the bridge (ooh-ooh!)

Oh, where there's a will,
There's always a way.
Where there's a will,
There's always a way (way, way, way, way),

Soul train is coming our way; er!
Zion train is coming our way.

Two thousand years of history (history)
Could not be wiped away so easily.
Two thousand years of history (Black history)
Could not be wiped so easily (could not be wiped so easily).

Oh, children, Zion train is comin' our way; get on board now!
They said the Zion train is comin' our way;
you got a ticket, so thank the Lord!
Zion's train is - Zion's train is - Zion's train is - Zion's train -
They said the soul train is coming our way;
They said the soul train is coming our way. [fadeout]
