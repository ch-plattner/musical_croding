So Jah seh,
"Not one of my seeds
Shall sit in the sidewalk
And beg bread."
(No, they can't and you know that they won't!)

So Jah seh,
"Not one of my seeds
Shall sit in the sidewalk
And beg your bread."
(No, they can't and you know that they won't!)
"And verily, verily, I'm saying unto thee, 'I
Inite oneself and love Imanity.'"
'Cause puss and dog they get together:
What's wrong with loving one another?
Puss and dog they get together:
What's wrong with you my brother?

So Jah seh,
"Ye are the sheep of my pasture;
So verily, thou shall be very well."
So Jah seh - yeah! -
"Ye are the sheep of my pasture;
So verily, thou shall be very well," yeah!

And down here in the ghetto,
And down here we suffer.
But I'n'I a-hang on in there
And I'n'I, I naw leggo;
I'n'I a-hang on in there
and I'n'I, I naw leggo.

For so Jah seh - yeah! -
"I'm gone to prepare a place,
That where I am thou shall abide," yeah!
So Jah seh,
"Fear not for mighty dread,
'Cause I'll be there at your side."

And - and down there - down there in the ghetto -
And down there we suffer
But I'n'I a-hang on in there
And I'n'I, I naw leggo.
But I'n'I a-hang on in there
And I'n'I, I naw leggo;
- So Jah seh.
