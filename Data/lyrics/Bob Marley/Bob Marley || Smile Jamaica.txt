
Feeling out, feeling down:
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone.
Then up came-a one that said (hey, Dread):
"Hey, Dread, fly, Natty Dread, and smile!"

You're in Jamaica: C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, y'all!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, now!
In Jamaica, y'all.

Soulful town, soulful people:
Said, I see you're having fun,
Dancin' to the reggae rhythm,
Oh, island in the sun:
Oh, smile!

(In Jamaica) C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, children!
(In Jamaica, y'all)

We're gonna help our people, help them right;
Oh, Lord, help us tonight!
Cast away that evil spell;
Throw some water in the well,
And smile!

(In Jamaica) C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get things together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica, y'all)

Riddim wise (wise),
Dub-a wise (wise),
And other wise (wise)
Can't criticize (-cize) our smile.

(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!
(In Jamaica, y'all)

Help my people, help them right!
O Lord, help us tonight!
Cast away evil spell;
Throw some water in the well,
And smile!

(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, children!
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!
(In Jamaica, y'all)

Soulful town, soulful people,
Said, I know, I know that you're having fun!
