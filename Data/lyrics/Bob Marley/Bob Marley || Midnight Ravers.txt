(You can't tell the woman from the man)
No, I say you can't, 'cause they're dressed in the same pollution;
(dressed in the same pollution)
Their mind is confused with confusion
With their problems since they've no solution:
They become the midnight ravers.

Someone say:
(Please, don't let me down!)
Oh, please, don't let me - ee-ya-bab, oh, please don't let me down!
(Midnight) Midnight ravers! (ravers) Midnight ravers!
(Please don't) Oh, please, please,
don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
Don't let me down;
Don't let me down.

I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders - they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)
So you couldn't make them out in smoky place -
(make them out in smoky places)
In that musical stampede, where everyone is doing their thing.
Musical stampede - people swingin';
Musical stampede. Someone say:
People, ride on! (keep a-ridin'!)
(keep a-ridin'!) Ride on!
(keep a-ridin'!) Midnight ravers!
People, ride on! (keep a-ridin'!)
(keep a-ridin'!) Ride on!
(keep a-ridin'!) Midnight ravers!

I can't tell my woman from the man:
She is dressed in the same pollution; (dressed in the same pollution)
Her mind is confused with confusion:
To my problem seems there's never - never no solution!

I've become a night-life raver
And I'm beggin' you, (please) please, please -
oh, beel-ya-ba-ba - please don't ya let me down!

(Night-life ravers) Night-life ravers! Night-life ravers!
Oh, please, please, please, please, don't let me down.
Don't let me down;
Don't let me down!

I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)
So you couldn't make them out in smoky place -
In that musical stampede, oh!

It's the musical stampede, some preacher say!
People ride on! (keep a-ridin'!)
