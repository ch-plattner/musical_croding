(Hallelu-Jah!)

Love to see when ya move in the rhythm;
I love to see, when you're dancin' from within!
It gives great joy to feel such sweet togetherness,
Everyone doin' and they're doing their best
Huh, it remind I of the days in Jericho,
When we troddin' down Jericho walls:
These are the days when we'll trod t'rough Babylon, (na-na, na-na)
Gonna trod until Babylon falls.

Sing your song yah!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi! ...
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi! ...
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!

We've got the herb (got it!),
We've got the herb (got it!),
We've got the herb (got it!),
So hand I the suru board,
'Cause most of all we ain't got nothing to lose. We-e-e-ey!

(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi! A little bit loud[er]!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump, Nyabinghi!)

Love to see when ya groove with the riddim,
'Cause I love to when you're dancing from within!
It gives great joy to see such sweet togetherness,
'Cause everyone's doin' and they're doing their best.
'Cause it remind me of the days in Jericho
When we troddin' down Jericho walls!
These are the days when we'll trod through Babylon,
We keep on troddin' until Babylon falls!

(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi! [fadeout]
