Lively up yourself, 'cause this is the other bag
Hey, lively up yourself and don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, dig it, the other bag

Hey, you rock so, you rock so, like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so, and you can dip thru my door
You come so, you come so, oh yeah, like I do adore you
You skank so, you skank so, and-a I can assure you

You can lively up yourself and don't be no drag
Hey, you lively up yourself, can you dig it?

Hey (you rock so, you rock so), like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so, can you dig it?

You lively up yourself and don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, 'cause this is the other bag
Hey, lively up yourself

Lively up yourself, other bag
Can you dig it? Can you dig it? ...
