
We no know how we and dem a-go work this out, oy!
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out.

But someone will 'ave to pay
For the innocent blood
That they shed every day,
Oh, children, mark my word;
It's what the Bible say, yeah! yeah!

Oh, we no know how we and dem a-go work this out;
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out.

But in the beginning Jah created everythin' (oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh),
Givin' man dominion over all things.
But now it's too late,
You see, men has lost their faith (oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh), hey-ey-hey!
Eating up all the flesh from off the earth, eh!

We no know how we and dem a-go work this out (we no know);
We no know how we and dem a-go work this out (no, we don't know);
Dub-da-dub-da-dub!
Dub-a-dippidi-doop-de-doo!
Nim-a-nummany num-na-noo!
Num-a-nummana-num-da-nay!
Dippy-dippy-dippy: dip-de-dub-de-day!
Dip-a-dubbada-dub-da-day!

But I say: we no know how we and dem a-go work it out:
them a flesh and bone!
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out.

But we now have no friends
In-a high society, yea-a-eah!
We no have no friends;
Oh, mark my identity;
We no have no friends. Oh-oh! Yeah!

We no know how we and dem a-go work this out (no, we no know);
We no know how we and dem a-go work this out (we no know);
We no know how we and dem a-go work it out (no, we don't know);
(We no know how we and dem a-go work this out.) Rasta!
(We no know how we and dem a-go work this out.) Ilyabom! [fadeout]
