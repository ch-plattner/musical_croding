
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity.
Yes, you have gone for so long
With your love for vanity now.
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain imagination.

So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon,
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars,
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yea-eah!

The lips of the righteous teach many,
But fools die for want of wisdom.
The rich man's wealth is in his city;
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Place.

So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon,
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars,
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yeah!
Destruction of the poor is in their poverty;
Destruction of the soul is vanity, yeah!

So stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity, yea-ea-eah!
Yes, you have gone - gone for so long
With your love for vanity now.

But I don't wanna rule ya!
I don't wanna fool ya!
I don't wanna school ya:
Things you - you might never know about!

Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain - vain imagination:
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for, o-ooh, simplicity. [fadeout]
