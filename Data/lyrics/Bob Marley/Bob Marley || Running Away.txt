Ya running and ya running,
But ya can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself -
Can't run away from yourself -
Can't run away from yourself -
Can't run away from yourself -
Can't run away from yourself.

Ya must have done (must have done),
Somet'in' wrong (something wrong).
Said: ya must have done (must have done),
Wo! Somet'in' wrong (something wrong).

Well, well, well, well, ya running away, heh, no -
Ya running away, ooh, no, no, no,
I'm not (running away), no, don't say that - don't say that,
'Cause (running away) I'm not running away, ooh! (running away)
I've got to protect my life, (running away)
And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion. (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left ya; (running away)
Now you comin' to tell me (running away)
That I'm runnin' away. (running away)
But it's not true, (running away)
I am not runnin' away. (running away) [fadeout]
