Revelation reveals the truth - revelation.
(revolution, revolution, revolution - oooo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(revolution - oooo-doo-doo-doo-doo)

It takes a revolution (revolution) to make a solution;
(doo-doo-doo-doo)
Too much confusion (aaa-aaah), so much frustration, eh!
I don't wanna live in the park (live in the park);
Can't trust no shadows after dark (shadows after dark), yeah-eh!
So, my friend, I wish that you could see,
Like a bird in the tree, the prisoners must be free, yeah! (free)

Never make a politician (aaa-aaah) grant you a favour;
(doo-doo-doo-doo)
They will always want (aaa-aaah) to control you forever, eh!
(forever, forever)
So if a fire make it burn (make it burn, make it burn)
And if a blood make ya run (make ya run, run, run),
Rasta de 'pon top (aaa-aaah), can't you see? (doo-doo-doo-doo)
So you can't predict the flop. Eh-eh! (doo-doo-doo-doo)

We got lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder),
brimstone (brimstone) and fire - fire (fire, fire);
Lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder),
brr-brimstone (brimstone) and fire - fiyah - fire - fiyah!
(fire, fire)

Kill, cramp and paralyze all weak at conception;
(aaa-aaah, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Wipe them out of creation (creation), yeah-eah! (creation)
Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! (creation)
Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! (creation)

Oh! Let i'es is i'es (i'es), in i'es is black (i'es),
In i'es is red (i'es), in i'es is dread.

Let righteousness cover the earth
Like the water (aaa-aaah) cover the sea, yeah! Yeah!

Lightning (lightning), doo-doo-doo (thunder),
doo-doo-doo (brimstone), doo-doo-doo (fire, fire);
A lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder),
brimstone (brimstone) and fire.
