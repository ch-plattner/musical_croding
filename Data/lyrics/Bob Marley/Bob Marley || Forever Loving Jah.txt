
Wo-o-o-o! Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya! Woy-oh!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! Oh!
(We'll be forever loving Jah;
We'll be forever loving Jah!)

Some they say see them walking up the street;
They say we're going wrong to all the people we meet;
But-a we won't worry, we won't shed no tears:
We found a way to cast away the fears,
Forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) There'll be no end.

So, old man river, don't cry for me;
A-have got a running stream of love you see.
So, no matter what stages - oh stages -
Stages - stages they put us through,
We'll never be blue
No matter what rages, oh rages,
Changes - rages they put us through,
We'll never be blue:
We'll be forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, and ever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) 'Cause there is no end.

'Cause only a fool lean upon -
Lean upon his own misunderstanding, oh ho, oh, yeah!
And then what has been hidden
From the wise and the prudent
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
In everyt'ing, in every way, I say, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah)

'Cause just like a tree planted - planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruits - bringeth forth fruits in due season;
Everything in life got its purpose,
Find its reason in every season,
Forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) On and on and on!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever, yes, yes -
we'll be forever.
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
