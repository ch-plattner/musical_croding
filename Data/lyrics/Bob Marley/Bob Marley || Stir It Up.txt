Stir it up; little darlin', stir it up. Come on, baby.
Come on and stir it up: little darlin', stir it up. O-oh!

It's been a long, long time, yeah!
(stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Since I got you on my mind. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh-oh!
Now you are here (stir it, stir it, stir it together), I said,
it's so clear
There's so much we could do, baby, (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Just me and you.

Come on and stir it up; ..., little darlin'!
Stir it up; come on, baby!
Come on and stir it up, yeah!
Little darlin', stir it up! O-oh!

I'll push the wood (stir it, stir it, stir it together),
then I blaze ya fire;
Then I'll satisfy your heart's desire. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Said, I stir it every (stir it, stir it, stir it together),
every minute:
All you got to do, baby, (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is keep it in, eh!

Stir it up; ..., baby!
Come on and stir it up, oh-oh-oh!
Little darlin', stir it up! Wo-oh! Mm, now, now.

Quench me when I'm thirsty;
Come on and cool me down, baby, when I'm hot. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Your recipe is, - darlin' - is so tasty,
When you show and stir your pot. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

So: stir it up, oh!
Little darlin', stir it up; wo, now!
Come on and stir it up, oh-ah!
Little darlin', stir it up!
