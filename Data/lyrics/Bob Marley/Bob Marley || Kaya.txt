
Wake up and turn me loose
Wake up and turn me loose
Wake up and turn me loose
For the rain is falling

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

I'm so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

Feelin' irie I
Feelin' irie I
Feelin' irie I
'Cause I have some kaya now

I feel so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now, Lord
For the rain is falling

(Kaya now, kaya, kaya) Huh
