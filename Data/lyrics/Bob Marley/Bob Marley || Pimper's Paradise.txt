
She love to party, have a good time;
She looks so hearty, feeling fine;
She loves to smoke, sometime shiftin' coke;
She'll be laughin' when there ain't no joke.

A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
Pimper's paradise: that's all she was.
(Every need got an ego to feed;
Every need got an ego to feed.)

She loves to model up in the latest fashion (oo-bee doo-be doo);
She's in the scramble and she moves with passion (oo-bee doo-be doo),
She's getting high, trying to fly the sky (oo-bee doo-be doo)!
Eh! Now she is bluesing when there ain't no blues.

Wo-o-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was, oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was.

(Every need got an ego to feed;
Every need got an ego to feed.)

Wo-ho-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now, wo-oo-o-oo! Wo-oh!
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was. We-e-e-ell-a!
A pimper's paradise: I'm sorry for the victim now;
Oh, now soon their (pimper's paradise) - soon their heads - soon their -
Soon their very heads will bow.
(Pimper's paradise) Don't lose track - don't lose track of yourself, oh no!
(Pimper's paradise) Don't be just a stock - a stock on the shelf -
stock on the shelf, oh-oh!
(Pimper's paradise) that's all she was now. Wo-oo-o-oo-o-oo ...
