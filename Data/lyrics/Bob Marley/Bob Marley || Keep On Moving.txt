Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

I've been accused for the killin'
Lord knows I didn't do
For hangin' me, they are willin', yeah, yeah
And that's why I've got to get on thru
Lord, they're coming after me (a-one more time)

(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

(Now, listen) I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now
Lord, forgive me for not goin' back
But I'll be there anyhow
I'll be there anyhow (one more time)

(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

Now, maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by near anyone
Then I'll send for my love, love, love, love, sweet woman
And my two grown up son
My two grown up son (yeah, yeah ...)

(I say now) Lord I've got to keep on moving ...
