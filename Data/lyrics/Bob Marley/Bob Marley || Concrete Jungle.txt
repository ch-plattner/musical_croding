The high yellow moon won't come out to play (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness (has come and covered my light) has covered my light,
(And has changed)
And has changed (my day into night) my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Won't someone tell me 'cause
Life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere out there for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!),
I said where the living is hardest (concrete jungle!).
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you got to do your best (concrete jungle!)
Wo-ooh

No chains around my feet
But I'm not free
I know I am bounded in captivity; oh now
(Never known) Never known (what happiness is) what happiness is;
(Never known) I've never known (what sweet caress is) what sweet caress is yeah
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown; (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Oh someone help me 'cause I (sweet life) -
I've got to pick myself from off the ground (got to be, out there somewhere out there for me)
In this ya concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!):
I said, what do you got for me (concrete jungle!) now?
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!), why won't you let me be (concrete jungle!) now?
Ohhh yeah

[Guitar solo]

I said that life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere for me)
Oh, instead: concrete jungle (jungle!) - collusion (concrete jungle!) -
Confusion (confusion). Eh!

Concrete jungle (jungle!): we've made it, We've got it.
In Concrete jungle (concrete jungle!), now. Eh!
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!).

What, what do you got for me (jungle, jungle!) now? [fadeout]
