Roots Natty roots
Dread Binghi dread
I and I are the roots
Some are the dry wood

Fe catch up the fire
Whoa, Lo ok at that
They need some dry wood
To cook up the raw food
Whoa, look at that

I got to survive
Inna dis man maniac downpression
Got to survive
In iration, yeah
Roots Natty roots
Dread Binghi dread
Remember that I and I are the roots
Some are wolf
Inna sheep's clothing
Whoa, look at that
Many are called
But only a few are chosen
Whoa, look at that
Nothing that dividers can do
Can't seperate us from our father
Whoa, look at that
You see, blood is thicker than water
Whoa, look at that

Got to survive
inna disyah ghetto, yeah
Roots Natty roots
Dread Binghi dread
Remember that I and I are the roots
Roots Natty roots
Dread Binghi dread
Whoa, I and I are the roots
Some are leaves
While some are branches
But remember I and I are the roots
Some are dry wood
Fe catch up the fire
Whoa, look at that

Got to survive
Inna dis man maniac downpression
Got to survive
