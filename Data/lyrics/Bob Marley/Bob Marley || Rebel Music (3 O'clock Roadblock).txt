Do do do do-do do do!
I rebel music;
I rebel music.)
Why can't we roam (oh-oh-oh-oh) this open country? (open country)
Oh, why can't we be what we wanna be? (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We want to be free. (wanna be free)

3 o'clock roadblock - curfew,
And I've got to throw away -
Yes, I've got to throw away -
A yes-a, but I've got to throw away
My little herb stalk!

I (rebel music) - yeah, I'm tellin' you! -
(I) I rebel music (rebel music). Oh-ooh!

Take my soul (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
and suss - and suss me out (suss me out). Oh-ooh!
Check my life (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh),
if I am in doubt (I'm in doubt); I'm tellin':
3 o'clock roadblock - roadblock - roadblock,
And "Hey, Mr. Cop! Ain't got no - (hey) hey! (hey, Mr Cop) -
(What ya sayin' down there?) - (hey) hey! (hey, Mr Cop) -
Ain't got no birth certificate on me now."

[Instrumental break]

(I rebel music)
(I rebel music)
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(open country)
(oh-oh-oh)

(Do do do!)
I (rebel music) - yeah, I'm tellin' you! -
(I) I rebel music (rebel music).

Oh-ooh! Take my soul (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
and suss - and suss me out (suss me out). Oh-ooh!
Check my life (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh),
if I am in doubt (I'm in doubt); I'm tellin':
3 o'clock roadblock - roadblock - roadblock,
And "Hey, Mr. Cop! Ain't got no - (hey) hey! (hey, Mr Cop) -
(What ya sayin' down there?) - (hey) hey! (hey, Mr Cop) -
Ain't got no birth certificate on me now."
