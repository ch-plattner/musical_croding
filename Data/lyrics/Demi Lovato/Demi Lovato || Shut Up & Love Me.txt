
We were fine this morning
Now I feel like I'm dreamin'
You try to tell me what's happened
But I can't hear when you're screamin'
Oh-oh

No more "I'm sorry"s
I don't have the time
You break up to make up
So spare me the light

Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby

You know it's not right
We could've been smilin'
You should've seen the light
Inside my eyes
And I shouldn't have been crying
Oh, no

Don't say you need me
Don't promise to change
I know that you mean it
There's nothing to say

Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Oh-oh

Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
And as much as it hurts
I need love from you, baby
Oh-oh-oh

And how can you be
Too blind to see
The girl who stands before you
Who wants you more than anything

Just shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Oh-oh

Oh, just shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
And as much as it hurts
I need love from you, baby
