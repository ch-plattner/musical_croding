I knew where I was going when you left the room
You're the kinda guy that makes me want to
Follow through to you
I've been trying to leave you for the longest time
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my right guy

I like it [x6]
I wanna crash
I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in the middle
Something
It's better than nothing
I just need a little
I just need a little cause I
Don't wanna be nowhere
But somethings makin' me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

I like it [x6]

Losing my direction,
That's the way it should be
Feeling a connection
When you're standing next to me
I wanna be rolling
I just wanna be rolling with you.

All of the things you say
I like it
Taking me far away
I like it

I wanna crash
I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in the middle
Something
It's better than nothing
I just need a little
I just need a little cause I
Don't wanna be nowhere
But somethings makin' me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

Maybe you'll save me
You're gonna take me
From this crazy I've been painting
'Cause I just need a little
I just need a little
Somewhere in the middle with you

CRASH
I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in the middle
Something
It's better than nothing
I just need a little
I just need a little cause I
Don't wanna be nowhere
But somethings making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

CRASH
FALL
I like it I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you
