Yes I understand
You were on time at the wrong time
I was debating but tried, and I don't know why
You can act cold on a dime and so out of line

For you
I’d do anything for you
Nail my heart to the ceiling
I'd put my fist through a wall
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all

Reasons for my hope, all make me a big joke
I already know
You were just fine, I was just fine
Why did we turn a good time to a dark one?
I'd give you a chance but the better man never called

Oh, oh

For you (for you)
I’d do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
I'd put my fist through a wall
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all

For you, I'd do
Anything for you, I would do
Anything for you, I would do
(Put my fist through a wall)
Anything for you, I would do

For you (for you)
I’d do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
I'd put my fist through a wall
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing
But I get nothing at all
I get nothing at all

For you, I'd do
Anything for you, I would do
Anything for you, I would do
Anything for you, I would do
Anything
