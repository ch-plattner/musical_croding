Don't walk away like you always do, this time.
Baby, you're the only thing that's been on my mind.
Ever since you left, I've been a mess
(You won't answer your phone)

I'll say it once, then I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know

I wanna get back
To the old days
when the phone would ring
and I knew it was you.
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to
Oh hold me [radio version],
Oh kiss me [album version],
like you mean it
Like you miss me,
'cause I know that you do.
I wanna get back
Get back with you
ayaaa...

don't look at me that way, I see it in your eyes.
Don't worry about me, I've been fine
I'm not gonna lie, I've been a mess
Since you've left

Everytime I see you, it gets more and more intense.

I wanna get back
To the old days
when the phone would ring
and I knew it was you.
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to
Oh hold me,
like you mean it
Like you miss me,
'cause I know that you do.
I wanna get back
Get back with you

You were the only one I wanted
You were the first one I fell for
You're the only one that I'm in need of
And I don't want to be lonely anymore

I wanna get back
To the old days
when the phone would ring
and I knew it was you.
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to,
Oh hold me
like you mean it
Like you miss me
'Cause you know you do
I wanna get back
Get back, with you

(Get back!) Get Back!
(Get back!) Get Back!
(Get back!) Get Back!
(Get back!) Get Back!

Oh hold me,
like you mean it
Like you miss me
'cause I know that you do

I wanna get back
Get back
I wanna get back
get back
Get back
Get back

Get back!

yaooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
