I can make the rain stop if I wanna,
Just by my attitude.
I can take my laptop, record a snapshot,
And change a point-of-view.

I just entered this brand new world,
And I'm so open hearted.
I know I got a long way to go but I'm
I'm just getting started.

I'm over my head
And I know it, I know it.
I'm doing my best
Not to show it, to show it.
Whatever it takes to be,
What I was meant to be,
I'm gonna try.
Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself, and time (and time, and time, time...)

I go where life takes me,
But some days it makes me,
Wanna change my direction.
Sometimes it gets lonely,
But I know that it's only,
A matter of my perception.

I just entered this brand new world,
And I'm so open hearted.
I know I got a long way to go but I'm-
I'm just getting started.

I'm over my head
And I know it, I know it.
I'm doing my best
Not to show it, to show it.
Whatever it takes to be,
What I was meant to be,
I'm gonna try.
Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself, and time

And baby, there's nothing like this moment.
To just be real and let the truth be spoken.
Whatever's broke I can make it unbroken.
Turn the light in my head into something golden.
If I just try,
More love.
If I just try.
More love.
Then I'll find, myself, in time.

I'm over my head
And I know it, I know it.
I'm doing my best
Not to show it, to show it.
Whatever it takes to be,
What I was meant to be,
I'm gonna try.

I'm over my head
And I know it, I know it.
I'm doing my best
Not to show it, to show it.
Whatever it takes to be,
What I was meant to be,
I'm gonna try.
Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself, and time

I'll find, myself, in time.
I know, I'll find, myself, in time.
