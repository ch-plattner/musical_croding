I love the way you're talking
I'm loving what you're doing boy
I don't fall easy often
I've never had a love like you before

I like you, put your number, put your number in my phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right so, call me, call me when you're all alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

Don't make plans
Come on with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long (hey)
All night long (hey), all night long (hey), all night, all night
All night long (hey), all night long (hey), all night, all night
A-a-a-all night

I'm on another planet
I'm in another universe
You may not understand it
Sooner or later baby you will learn

I like you, put your number, put your number in my phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right so, call me, call me when you're all alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

Don't make plans
Come on with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long

[Missy Elliott:]
We could party all night, night
Wanna spend a night, night
Will you be my type by the end of the night, we could pillow fight
Your Missy's real nice, come closer, cause I don't bite
You talking how I like, you play daddy, I play wife
I-I-I'm so alone, no-no-no one is home
I got your, got your na-na-number in my telephone
Wanna wanna wanna be your girl
Wanna wanna wanna be my babe
Boy we can hold hands, write our names in the sands
It's the weekend, don't make plans

[Demi Lovato & Timbaland:]
Party's hot, when you're here
At the club, we don't care
We gonna set it off, we gonna set it off

Party's hot, when you're here
At the club, we don't care
We gonna set it off, we gonna set it off

[Demi Lovato:]
Don't make plans
Come on with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long (hey)
All night long (hey), all night long (hey), all night, all night
All night long (hey), all night long (hey), all night, all night
A-a-a-all night
