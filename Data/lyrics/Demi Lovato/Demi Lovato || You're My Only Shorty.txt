Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
Come on, ring, ring, ring

Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee, I'm the only girl you see
What you say, boy

You're my only shorty, you're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth, girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only one and only
You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl, it's only you, whoa
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, you're my only shorty
Am I your only shorty?

Every day and night you got an open invitation, whoa
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me, I'll be your fantasy, oh, yeah

You're in demand but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you bye, bye
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy, woo

You're my only shorty, you're my only shorty
Am I your only, yeah?
I'm telling you the truth, girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only one and only
Am I your only?
You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl, it's only you, whoa
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, you're my only shorty
Am I your only shorty?

Please, baby, please, give me
All your attention, say it
Don't let my heart go seeking no other direction
I gotta be the only one for your affection, oh yeah
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention

You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
You're my only shorty, baby, come clean
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl, it's only you, oh
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, you're my only shorty
Am I your only shorty?

You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
You're my only shorty, am I your only shorty?
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl, it's only you, oh
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, you're my only shorty
Am I your only shorty?

Am I your only, am I your only?
Yeah, tell me, am I your only, yeah, shorty?
Yes you are, yes you are
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Am I your only shorty?
