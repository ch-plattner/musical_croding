[Verse 1:]
[Demi]
I didn't wanna say 'I'm sorry'
For breaking us apart
[Joe]
I didn't wanna say 'It was my fault'
Even though I knew it was
[Demi]
I didn't wanna call you back
Cause I knew that I was wrong
[Demi and Joe]
Yeah I knew I was wrong

[Chorus:]
[Demi]
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
[Demi and Joe]
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
[Joe]
Wanted to call
[Demi]
No need to fight
[Joe] 
You know I wouldn't lie
[Demi and Joe]
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line

[Verse 2:]
[Demi]
Listen baby
[Nick]
Never would have said 'Forever'
If I knew it'd end so fast
[Demi]
Why did you say 'I love you'
If you knew it that it wouldn't last
[Nick]
Baby I just can't hear what your saying
The line is breaking up
[Demi]
Or is that just us?
Or is that just us?

[Chorus:]
[Demi and Joe]
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
[Joe]
Wanted to call
[Demi]
No need to fight
[Joe] 
You know I wouldn't lie
[Demi and Joe]
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line

[Bridge:]
[Joe] 
I try to call again
I get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread
[Demi]
Apologies are often open ended
[Demi and Joe]
But this one's better left unsaid

[Chorus:]
[Demi and Joe]
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
[Joe]
Wanted to call
[Demi]
No need to fight
[Joe] 
You know I wouldn't lie
[Demi and Joe]
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
