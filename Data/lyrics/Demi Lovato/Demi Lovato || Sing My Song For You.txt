
Didn't know what to get you
Ordinary just wouldn't do
But I just found the perfect gift for you

I hear church bells a ringing
Carolers are singing harmony with me now
You are looking so lovely
Oh, even if the lights go out

We've got mistletoe and fire light
On this cold December night
The snow outside will set the mood
As I sing my song

We've got mistletoe and fire light
On this cold December night
The snow outside will set the mood
As I sing my song for you
Sing my song
Sing my song for you
