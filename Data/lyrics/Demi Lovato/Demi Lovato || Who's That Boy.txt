[Intro: Dev]
I wanna get you by yourself
Yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else
Don't want nobody else
He's special, I know
His smile, it glows
He's perfect, it shows
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
I've been starin' at ya
And I could do it all night
You're looking like an angel
With that kind of body needs a spotlight

Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do could be famous
I could see us making ways
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
You could say that I'm distracted
But ah you got me so attracted
But boy I'll tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room
Looking like like you, you, do

Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do could be famous
I could see us making way
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy

[Bridge: Demi Lovato]
Everybody in the club turn around sayin'
Who's that, who's that
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes, tell me
Who's that, who's that

[Dev:]
I got my eyes on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just wanna get him close
Wanna make him mine
Come hold my hand and dance away the night
Give me the green light
Kiss my lips
Who's that boy watching my hips?
I-I I wanna know who you are
My name is Dev and you can be my star

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy
