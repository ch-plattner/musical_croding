
And I feel, I feel a deep connection,
And I think that we might be on to something, no
And I know it's something special,
Seeing you here, is not coincidental,

Well I've been walking, walking behind enemy lines,
And I've been fighting, fighting, from the other side,
I've been saying, saying, I won't fall this time,
But now I'm walking, walking within enemy lines.

But I was trying to be everything you weren't expecting,
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing,
But I'm falling way too fast,
I just want thing love to last forever, forever,
And every time I feel this way, oh, something's changed for the better

And I've been walking, walking behind enemy lines,
And I've been fightin, fighting, from the other side,
But I've been saying, saying I won't fall this time,
Now I'm walkin, walkin, within enemy lines

And now I'm walkin, walkin, behind enemy lines,
But I've been fighting, fighting from the other side,
I've been saying, saying I won't fall this time,
But now I'm walking, walking within enemy lines
