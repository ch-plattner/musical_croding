Sexy lady knows what she wants out of life
See she got her own means
Doing whatever she likes

Feels good to have you
She don't need you
She can't depend on a man
After all that she's been through
She ain't running behind you
Trust me I know 'cause I am her

And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
It's in me (in me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't be defeated
I won't stop now
Got it all (got it all) figured out (figured out)
And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
I'm everything

I am
Yes I am yes I am (I am)
Yes I am yes I am

So you can't be mad that
She had the strength to survive
Through the good and the bad
She's having the time of her life

Feels so good to have you
She don't need you
She can't depend on a man
After all that she's been through
She ain't running behind you
Trust me I know 'cause I am her

And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
It's in me (in me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't be defeated
I won't stop now (stop now)
Got it all (got it all) figured out (figured out)
And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
I'm everything

I am
Yes I am, yes I am
Yes I am, yes I am
You are

If you are throw your hands up
(So put your hands up)
If you are let me see your hands up

And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
It's in me (in me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't be defeated
I won't (I won't) stop now (stop now)
Got it all (got it all) figured out (figured out)
And I got (I got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
I'm everything

I am
Yes I am, yes I am
Yes I am, yes I am
If you are throw your hands up
If you are let me see your hands up.
