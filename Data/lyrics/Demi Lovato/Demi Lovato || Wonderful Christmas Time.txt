
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The party's on
The feelin's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding Ohhhh
Ohhhhhhh

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahhh don't look down

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
