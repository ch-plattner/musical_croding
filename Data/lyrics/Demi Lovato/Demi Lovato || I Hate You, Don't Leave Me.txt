
Hey, yeah yeah
I hate you, don’t leave me
I feel like I can’t breathe
Just hold me, don’t touch me
And I want you to love me
But I need you to trust me
Stay with me, set me free
But I can’t back down
No, I can’t deny
That I’m staying now
‘Cause I can’t decide
Confused and scared
I am terrified of you

I admit I’m in and out of my head
Don’t listen to a single word I’ve said
Just hear me out before you run away
‘Cause I can’t take this pain

I hate you, don’t leave me

I hate you, don’t leave me
‘Cause I love when you kiss me
I’m in pieces, you complete me
But I can’t back down
No, I can’t deny
That I’m staying now
‘Cause I can’t decide
Confused and scared
I am terrified of you

I admit I’m in and out of my head
Don’t listen to a single word I’ve said
Just hear me out before you run away
‘Cause I can’t take this pain, no

I’m addicted to the madness
I’m a daughter of the sadness
I’ve been here too many times before
Been abandoned and I’m scared now
I can’t handle another fall out
I’m fragile, just washed upon the shore

They forget me, don’t see me
When they love me, they leave me

I admit I’m in and out of my head
Don’t listen to a single word I’ve said
Just hear me out before you run away
‘Cause I can’t take this pain
No, I can’t take this pain
I hate you, don’t leave me
I hate you, please love me
