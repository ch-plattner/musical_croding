[Joe Jonas:]
Words don't come easy without a melody
I'm always thinking In terms of do-re-mi
I should be hiking, swimming laughing with you
Instead I'm all out of tune

But what you don't know
You lift me off the ground
You're inspiration, you helped me find my sound,
Just like a baseline a half-time
You hold down the groove
That's why I'm counting on you

And if I heard you on the radio
I'd never wanna change a single note
It's what I tried to say all along
You're my favorite song

I'm in a session writing tracks
You've got another class to teach

And then rehearsal with a band
You're always one step out of reach
I'm looking for some harmony
With you it comes so naturally
You helped me find the right key

[Joe Jonas & Demi Lovato:]
And when I hear you on the radio
I'd never wanna change a single note
It's what I tried to say all along
You're my favorite song

My Favorite Song!

And when I hear you on the radio (yeah yea)
I'd never wanna change a single note (no no)
It's what I tried to say all along

[Demi Lovato:]
You're my favorite song
[Joe Jonas:]
You're my favorite song
