
Went down in South America
Met a boy in Colombia
Couldn't understand a word he said
So he took my hand instead
It was late as we ignored the time
Now I can't get this stranger off my mind
I think about him when I wear this dress
I still smell him in my hair

Was it the heat making you sweat
Was it the beat of the drum on my heart in my chest

"Eres muy bonita, " he said
"No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"
I can't wait till I see you again
"Besame mucho, princesa"
And then we dance

He said, "besame mucho", he kisses my hand and we dance

It was time for me to say goodbye
Couldn't stand to look him in the eye
Would've kissed him if I had the time
Could've have sworn it was on his mind

Was it his lips, the way he moves his waist
Hands on my hips,
Or just the look of desire on his face

"Eres muy bonita, " he said
"No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"
I can't wait till I see you again
"Besame mucho, princesa"
And then we dance

He said, "besame mucho", he kisses my hand

And then I close my eyes
For a moment in time
In the blink of an eye
I lost him in the crowd
He was young to be found
When I turned around
But I swear I can still hear him now

"Eres muy bonita, " he said
"No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"
I can't wait till I see you again
"Besame mucho, princesa"
And then we dance

He said, "besame mucho, " he kisses my hand and then we dance

We dance

"Eres muy bonita, " he says
