
You said that you'd never hurt me
Be the band-aid when I bleed
But I guess that that band-aid was all made of paper
Cause you never stuck to me
And you say that you conquered the lion
Without even tryin'
But she only gets stronger
She only bites harder and I only die fighting

You can run, you can run
But you know that I know just what you've done
You can run, you can run
But save those words for one on one

So when the lights go down
And the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out
And a guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Mmm

Yeah, I don't take things too personal
But you made shit personal
Talkin' 'bout my bad habits
Man, fuck my bad habits
Don't act like you got none

You can run, you can run
But you know that I know just what you've done
You can run, you can run
But save those words for one on one

So when the lights go down
And the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out
And a guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Mmm

[Sirah:]
You got my name in your mouth, forgive me when I knock it out
I love it when you talk about me just cause you don't know yourself
My jabs go-go for broke, your teeth is on the floor
Thirty million people watchin', do you still want more?
Fake bitches, gon' get it, I am winnin' but you isn't
Call your dentist cause I meant this, I don't see no competition
Goin' wild, Mikey Tyson, born a fighter, I will triumph
Bitch I thought you knew I was comin' for your title

So when the lights go down
And the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out
And a guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin', I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
