
Take care of yourself, darling.
I guess...I guess this is goodbye.
Tomorrow's coming quicker than yesterday came today.
I guess this is goodnight.
Cuz we've all got one last night together
so let's start the party!
You know we rocked! Promise you won't forget me!

[Chorus:]
So these moments spent are coming to an end.
I'm counting seconds until next time begins.
Listen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
We couldn't change it if we tried.
1, 2, 3, 4 goodbye.

We've all said before, Our Time is Here.
But it's never meant a thing until we began to tear.
And I'll be aching before and after we depart
from remembrances of the very start.
(The grand memories together [2x])
Now here I am, it's your song I'll be singing.
you're the voice I hear inside my head!

[Chorus]

We raised our voices.
We followed our dreams.
One thing, 'Who Will I Be?' you ask.
Well, we'll never be too cool for Camp Rock 3!

[Chorus]
