
Beats so heavy, make my head get hazy
Big boots make the ground shake crazy
Body so hot, feel like they taze me
Kill the lights, watch the crowd get shady

Girls gettin' tricky, move round like elastic
Boys turned on, you can see all the static
Charge it up, make it automatic
Stop the press, hear the kick go manic

I feel you move closer to me
All the signals peaking
Crank up my electricity
Till I overload

[Chorus:]
Lovestruck!
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell my self keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
Feel like my Heaven and Earth shake
Lovestruck!
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell myself keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock

Bass so thick you can see the soundwaves
Bubbly spilling like it's your birthday
Anthems blasting, now make the crowd sway
Put your hands up, shout "pon de replay"

I feel you move closer to me
All the signals peaking
Crank up my electricity
Till I overload

[Chorus]
Lovestruck!
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell my self keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
Feel like my Heaven and Earth shake
Lovestruck!
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell myself keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock

Hey-ay-ay-e-yae
In your aftershock (In the aftershock)
Hey-ay-ay-ay-e-yae

Your Lips conduct electric flow
Your kiss vibrates me head to toe
Your touch is glowing in the dark
Those neon eyes send me ablaze

Ooh-ooh-ooh-woah-woah

[Chorus]
Lovestruck!
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell my self keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
Feel like my Heaven and Earth shake
Lovestruck!
The tremors keeps repeating and I tell myself keep breathing
But I'm caught in your aftershock

Yeah
Woah ooh Woah
In the aftershock
