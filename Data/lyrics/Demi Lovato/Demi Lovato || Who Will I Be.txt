
Who Will I be?

Whoo, yeah, yeah, yeah!
How to choose
Who to be
Well lets see
There's so many choices now
Play guitar, be a moviestar
In my head, a voice says

[Chorus:]
Why not?
Try everything
Why stop?
Reach for any dream
I can rock
'cause it's my life and now's the time
Who will I be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities
That I can see
There's nothing that I can't do
Who will I be?
Yes I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I can become anyone and know the choice is
Up to me!

If I decide
I'm the girl
To change the world
I can do it anytime
Opportunity
Right in front of me
And the choice if all mine

[Chorus]

I wanna find the who I am inside
Who will I be
I wanna show the way that
I can shine, yeah!
Oh yeah!

Who will I be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities
That I can see
There's nothing that I can't do
Who will I be?
Yes I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I can become anyone and know the choice up to me
Who will I be?
Whoo, who will I be?
Who will I be!
