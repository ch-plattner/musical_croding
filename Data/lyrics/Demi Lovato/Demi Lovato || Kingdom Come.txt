Can we love until there's nothing left
And we're collecting dust?
Use the hell out of our golden souls
Until we're flecks of rust

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart, that I'll die for you
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo
And we go...

Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let it intertwine
Your hand in mine
And fill the empty space
All the demons cry
Cause you and I
Found love in a broken place

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart, that I'll die for you
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo
And we go...

[Demi Lovato (Iggy Azalea):]
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah
(Iggs)

[Iggy Azalea:]
Gather 'round, now I'm back from my holiday
"Long live the Queen" what the people say
And that be me, I got a king in my cavalry
Them other knights, say goodnight, they get apathy
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a Blue without Steve
See what I mean? You're my Caesar, burn my chariot
You know Family Matters, what's Carl without Harriet?
Inseparable like Mary Kate and Ashley
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me
To ride on them, them meaning chicks, you feel me?
I break 'em down, it's a sport, I should win an ESPY
Royalty, another level, boy your throne shine
Legendary love nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the king's men
We rule until the end, kingdom come

And we go
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah

You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah
You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
