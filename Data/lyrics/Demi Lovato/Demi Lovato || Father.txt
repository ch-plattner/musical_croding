
Father, I'm gonna say thank you
Even if I'm still hurt
Oh, I'm gonna say bless you
I wanna mean those words

Always wished you the best
I, I prayed for your peace
Even if you started this
This whole war in me

You did your best or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry, dad, for feelin' this
I can't believe I'm sayin' it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you
A second chance

Father, I'm gonna say thank you
Even if I don't understand
Oh, you left us alone
I guess that made me who I am

Always wished you the best
I, I, I pray for your peace
Even if you started this
This whole war in me

You did your best or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry, dad, for feelin' this
I can't believe I'm sayin' it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you
You did your best or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry, dad, for feelin' this
I can't believe I'm sayin' it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you
A second chance
