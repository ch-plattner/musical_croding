
Everyday is like a blank canvas
You know you can paint it anyway you want it
You can draw a black cloud
You can make the sun shine
Coloring a rainbow 
or use black and white

Open up your eyes and your imagination

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art

Oh every night is like looking at a dark screen
You're never too young or too old to dream
You can make a fantasy into a reality
'Cause you're creating your own masterpiece

Close your eyes and dream it
Seeing is believing

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art

Turn a simple thought into a philosophy
Turn a star into a galaxy
Make a little noise into a symphony
You're creating a masterpiece

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song
A little poetry
Take a photograph
Let's make some memories
You can make it anything
That you want it to be
If you follow your heart
Life is a work of art
Life is a work of art
Life is a work of art
