Walking in, we causing a frenzy
Walking in, we causing a...
Knock 'em all out, beat 'em like Rousey
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a
Rolling so deep, but we ain't thirsty
Rolling so deep, but we ain't
Talking trash, we keeping it classy
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a

Oh when the lights go out and it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes
Cause we live for now, you and I

And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars

Working all week got me all crazy
Working all week got me all...
Dancing dirty, get a little Swayze
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a
Get 'em hyped up, get 'em all talking
Get 'em hyped up, get 'em all...
Looking at you, feeling so fancy
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a

Oh when the lights go out and it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes
Cause we live for now, you and I

And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars

We're the only ones who can fight the Sun
We're forever young and we just begun
We're the only ones who can fight the Sun
We're forever young and we live for now
You and I

And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars
