
In real life I'm waking up alone
It's one more night you didn't make it home
And one more time you won't pick up the phone
In real life you never bring me flowers
When you're here it's only for an hour
I'm getting used to being on my own

Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem

But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realise, realise this is real life
Real life, this is real life
Real life, real life
Real life, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
Real life

In real life it doesn't always work out
People fall in love and then they fall out
Hearts can break and never make a sound

Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem

But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realise, realise this is real life

Just when I thought this was all real life could be
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Somebody came along and made my dream reality

And now in real life, waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, he's standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
When I wake up, I realise, realise this is real life
