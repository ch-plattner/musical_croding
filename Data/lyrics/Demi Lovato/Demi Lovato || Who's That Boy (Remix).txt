[Dev:]
I wanna get you by yourself
Yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else
Don't want nobody else
He's special, I know
His smile, it glows
He's perfect, it shows

Let's go!

[Demi Lovato:]
I've been starin' at ya
And I could do it all night
You're looking like an angel
With that kind of body needs a spotlight

Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do could be famous
I could see us making ways
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade
Now...

I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy

[Demi Lovato:]
You could say that I'm distracted
But ah you got me so attracted
But boy I'll tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room
Looking like like you, you, do

Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do could be famous
I could see us making way
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

Now I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be

[Iggy Azalea:]
You be on the internet, thirsty, prolly worse in person
Down payment for a car, I dropped that on a Birkin
You don't sit in VIP 'cause you ain't no important person
The money wrapped around my mind like a turban (Who's that boy, who's that boy)
Iggy got them pop titties but that ass on that urban (Who's that boy, who's that boy)
If I told you what I'm worth, you would throw up (Everybody in the club turn around sayin')
So have my money on time before I show up (Who's that, who's that)
I'm drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs (Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes, tell me)
Thinking money 25/8, no free days (Who's that, who's that)
If your girl dumb body, I recruit them
They ask me who you do it for, me say they youth them
Damn right, I like the life I live
Who else you know that slay like Iggz
You lil'... (bitch)

[Dev:]
I got my eyes on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just wanna get him close
Wanna make him mine
Come hold my hand and dance away the night (Dance away the night)
Give me the green light
Kiss my lips
Who's that boy watching my hips?
I-I I wanna know who you are
My name is Dev and you can be my star

[Demi Lovato:]
I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen,
No one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy

Who's that boy, who's that boy
Tell me who's that (boy)
Who's that (boy)
