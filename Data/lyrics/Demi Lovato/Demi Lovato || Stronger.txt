
The night is getting darker
Soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us
Sing a song for me
Lift me higher with your words
Sing that cold melody

So follow me onto the moonlit sidewalk
And take my hand
Grip it tighter and don't let it go

Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak negatively about us
But they can't say another word
But they'll realize jealousy
Has taken over their minds
And the words they try to break me down with
They only make us stronger

Did you feel that breeze?
A tide of chills just swept over me
It must have been from the brush of your hand
Pull me into your arms a little closer baby
I wanna see you standing next to me

So take a walk with me
But keep the pace down
I don't want this night to end
Can't we run away together?

Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak negatively about us
But they can't say another word

Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak negatively about us
But they can't say another word
But they'll realize jealousy
Has taken over their minds
And the words they try to break me down with
They only make us stronger

Oh whoa

The night is getting darker
Soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us
