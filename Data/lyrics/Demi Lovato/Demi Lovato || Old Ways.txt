It was fun playin' with knives
Until a blade
Stuck in the left side of my chest
Surprise
I'm not down again, I turned the page
The story's mine
No more watching the world from my doorstep
Passin' me by (passin' me by)

And I'll just keep changin'
These colors, colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place
That I was, I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways

Not going back to my old ways
(Not going back to my old ways)

Now I know what's good for me
All that I need
And I can't wait to sink my teeth in
And take another bite
And the best part about it
Is I'm only one who can do somethin' about it
I fill the well with some water, it's overflowing
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfolds

And I'll just keep changin'
These colors, colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place
That I was, I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways

Not going back to my old ways
(Not going back to my old ways)

Every scar
The flames burnt them all
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm spiraling
I'm spiraling
Past the stars
I'm not burning out
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm not afraid anymore

And I just keep changin' my colors
I'm not in the same place that I was, I was

(And the best part about it)
(Is I'm only one who can do somethin' about it)
(I fill the well with some water, it's overflowing)
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfold

And I just keep changin'
These colors, colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place
That I was, I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways
