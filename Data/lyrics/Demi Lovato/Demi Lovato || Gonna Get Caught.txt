You reeled me in with your smile
You made me melt with your voice
Now I've been gone now for awhile
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice
And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it'd be best if you get lost
Cause we know you'll never change

[Chorus:]
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time
And don't say its forever
And don't play cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught

You promised me all of your time
I guess I'm not the only one
But see it's my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one or I'm gone

[Chorus:]
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time
And don't say its forever
And don't play cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught

Go and try to get me back
I won't forget about our past
I never had the guts to leave
Now your making it
Now your making it much easier for me to see

And don't say that you're sorry
For breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start now it's time to get lost
And don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time
And don't say its forever
And don't play cause you had you shot
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught.
