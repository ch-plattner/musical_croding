We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
We'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Be still, my heart 'cause it's freakin' out, it's freakin' out, right now
Shining like stars 'cause we're beautiful, we're beautiful, right now
You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
So let's pretend we're running out of time, of time

Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Neon lights
Neon lights
Neon lights
Like neon lights, oh
Like neon lights, oh

Be still, my heart 'cause it's freakin' out, it's freakin' out, right now
Shining like stars 'cause we're beautiful, we're beautiful, right now
You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
So let's pretend we're running out of time, of time

Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights

We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Neon lights
Neon lights
Neon lights
Like neon lights, oh
Like neon lights, oh

Shining like stars 'cause we're beautiful, beautiful
You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
