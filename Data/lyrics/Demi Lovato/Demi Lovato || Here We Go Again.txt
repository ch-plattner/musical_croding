
I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
And ignore all your messages
I tell everyone we are through
'Cause I'm so much better without you
But it's just another pretty lie
'Cause I break down
Every time you come around
(Uh, Oh Uh, Oh)

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better
Then trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're fallin' together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go go go again

You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Everytime that you look at me
You only hear half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye
But it's no use
Can't be with or without you
(Uh, Oh Uh, Oh)

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better
Then trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're fallin' together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go go go again

And again and again and again
I throw all your stuff away
And then I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart
(Uh, Oh Uh, Oh)

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better
Then trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're fallin' together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go go

Here we go again
Here we go again
Should've known better
Then trying to let you go
'Cause here we go go go again
Again and again and again and again
