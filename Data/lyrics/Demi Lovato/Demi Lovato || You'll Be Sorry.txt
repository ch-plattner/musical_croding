
Who do you think you are, leaving me stranded
You've gone too far, you're too demanding
How many times, how many chances
Should I let you take me for granted

You believed that love
Is a silly word
Before you break my heart
Let me get a head start

But when you're leaving don't forget to say goodbye
Don't come back to me this time saying you're sorry, that you love me
And when you're leaving don't forget to leave your key
Don't think I can't take care of me
You'll be sorry, you'll be sorry

You had me soul but you went past it
So in control, so demanding
When you were mine, thought it would've lasted
Even though you're fine, don't think I can't manage

You believed that love
Is a silly word
You believed that love
Is a silly word

But when you're leaving don't forget to say goodbye
Don't come back to me this time saying you're sorry, that you love me
And when you're leaving don't forget to leave your key
Don't think I can't take care of me
You'll be sorry
You'll be sorry

Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...

But when you're leaving don't forget to say goodbye
Don't come back to me this time saying you're sorry, that you love me
And when you're leaving don't forget to leave your key
Don't think I can't take care of me
You'll be sorry, you'll be sorry

Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...
You'll be sorry
Ooh oh...
