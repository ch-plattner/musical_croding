
I remember you walked out the door
So I stayed awake for days
No pill or drink could get me off the floor
Nothing seemed to ease the pain

Listen to me honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay

Oh he's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause his high school dreams
They never went too far
And he's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star (Hey!)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you

This is for the times you broke my heart
And all the years you led me on
Now you're asking for a brand new start
But you're way too late and now I'm gone

Listen to me honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay

Oh he's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause his high school dreams
They never went too far
And he's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star (Hey!)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you

How could you think I'm so stupid, I wouldn't see through?
I always do
Now I got a new man
And he's ten times the man you could ever be, Mr. Hughes

He's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause his high school dreams
They never went too far
And he's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you
