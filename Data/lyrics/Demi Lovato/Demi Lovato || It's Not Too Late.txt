Here I am, feels like the walls are closing in
Once again, it's time to face it and be strong
I wanna do the right thing now
I know it's up to me somehow
I've lost my way

If I could take it all back I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try to turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late
Maybe it's not too late

So I'll take a stand even though it's complicated
If I can I wanna change the way I made it
I gotta do the right thing now
I know it's up to me somehow
I'll find my way

If I could take it all back I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try to turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late

I'm gonna find the strength to be the
One that holds it all together
Show you that I'm sorry but I
Know that we can make it better

If I could take it all back I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try to turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late

I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try to turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late
Maybe it's not too late
