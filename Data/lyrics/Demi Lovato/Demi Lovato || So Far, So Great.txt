Off to the races
I'm going places
Might be a long shot
Not gonna waste it
This is the big break
And it's calling my name
Yeah

So far so great, get with it
At least that's how I see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, believe it
Can't take away this feeling
Taking a ride with chance to my side
Yeah, I can't wait
So far, so great

Might need to wing it
Still gonna bring it
Not gonna sink low
I'm going swimming
Swing for the fences
Sky's not the limit today
Yeah

So far so great, get with it
At least that's how I see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, believe it
Can't take away this feeling
Taking a ride with chance to my side
Yeah, I can't wait
So far, so great

Everyone says don't get your hopes up
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder
I know in the end that just being here is the best
And it only gets better, it only gets better

So far so great, get with it
At least that's how I see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, believe it
Can't take away this feeling
Taking a ride with chance to my side
Yeah, I can't wait
So far, so great
I can't wait
So far so great

Ba ba da da da ba da da da da
