The space in between us
Starts to feel like we're worlds apart
Like I'm going crazy
And you say it's raining in your heart
You're telling me nobody's there to dry up the flood
Oh, but that's just crazy
'Cause baby, I told ya I'm here for good

My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine and remember I'm always near
If you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone

I try to build the walls to keep you safe
When I'm not around
But as soon as I'm away from you
You say they come tumbling down

But it's not about the time
That we don't get to spend together
Oh, it's about how strong our love is
When I'm gone and it feels like forever

My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine and remember I'm always near
If you see a comet, if you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home, my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone

You say the time away makes your heart grow numb
But I can't stay just to prove you wrong
Oh, look at how far we've come
Don't you know, don't you know that you're the one
Oh, you're not alone
You're not alone, oh
You're not alone, oh
You're not alone, oh
Know that you're not alone
You're not

My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
Know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine and remember I'm always near, yeah
If you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home
Making my way back to you
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone
Yeah-yeah, yeah, oh, oh
