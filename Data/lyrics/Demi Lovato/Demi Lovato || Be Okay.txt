It's saturday morning
I'm still yawing
Iphone is going beep

Tryinna see what's going on
Grabbed it wrong
Dropped and I cracked my screen

So now I'm pissed
My door get's kicked
My girlfriend screaming an emergency

She was out last night
And she see my new guy
With a girl but it wasn't me

Now she's talking 'bout girl, let's kill him
But I got a better way to get him

Hanging up like she just didn't see him
Put him on blast like a chicken I'll grill him

If you don't wanna answer the text when I send them
Baby why you wiggin' on me?
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Keep saying me, keep saying me
Boy betcha imma be okay
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be
Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be okay

Put it up the red light look over to my
And I see you on her arm
Had to pull your car
But you took it to far
Now I'm chilling in jonny's car

Driving on the four five
Fendi's in my eyes
The radio up on ten
Guess it's all my fault, shouldn't listen to my girls
It's all, it's all my fault shouldn't listen to my girls

Now she's talking 'bout girl, let's kill him
But I got a better way to get him

Hanging up like she just didn't see him
Put him on blast like a chicken I'll grill him

If you don't wanna answer the text when I send them
Baby why you wiggin' on me?
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Keep saying me, keep saying me
Boy betcha imma be okay
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be
Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be okay

Unplug the phone, unplug the phone
If you calling me, click, you gon get the dial tone
Unplug the phone, unplug the phone
If you calling me, click, you gon get the dial tone

He be driving me crazy, he be driving me crazy
He be driving me crazy, he be driving me crazy

If you don't wanna answer the text when I send them
Baby why you wiggin' on me?
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Keep saying me, keep saying me
Boy betcha imma be okay
At the end of the day I've got the last laugh
Boy betcha imma be okay

Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be
Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be
Okay, okay, okay
I bet you imma be okay
