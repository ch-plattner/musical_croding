
Don't try to cover up your,
Your new flame that's seething through your eyes,
I can see it from ten feet away,
And I know just who is burning,

With every kiss you deny,
So what makes you think that I still care
Or still want you anymore?

So how long has this been going on?
And one more thing to tell me,
Was she the reason,
You stomped on my heart,
And moved on so quickly,

Hey yay ya,

You can call it pure torture,
Watching your every move with her,
Oh just the thought of it knowing,
What's going on between you and her,
Makes me sick,

I should've noticed, I should've noticed,
When she came into the picture,
You were always with her,
And she's not leaving,

uh uh

So how long has this been going on?
And one more thing to tell me,
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart?

You called me shady,
Now she's your baby doll,
She took you over,
Over to break it off,

And this time just maybe,
Maybe you went a little far,
I'm sick of crying about, about,
Your new flame,
that's soon to be burn out

So how long has this been going on?
And one more thing to tell me,
Was she the reason,
You stomped on my heart,
And moved on so quickly?
oh, oh, ohh
