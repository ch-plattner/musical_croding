U got nothin' on me
U got nothin' on me
U got nothin' on me

Summer came you took me by surprise
The California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down we sang along
To our favorite songs, nothing could go wrong

[Verse 2:]
Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything could tear us apart
That you'd break my heart

[Chorus:]
Now I know who you are
U got nothing on me, I see
I should've known it from the start
(U got nothing on me)
You can't tell me lies
Don't even try 'cause
This is goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 3:]
Caught you from the corner of my eye
You smiled at a girl while passing by
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
I know what's going on, it didn't take me long

[Verse 4:]
It wasn't hard to read between the lines
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine
Nothing left for you to do or say, so I'm on my way
Now it's too late

[Chorus:]
Now I know who you are
U got nothing on me, I see
I should've known it from the start
(U got nothing on me)
You can't tell me lies
Don't even try 'cause
This is...

Goodbye to broken promises
Time to face your carelessness
Don't bore me with apologies
Or come back crawling on
your knees

U got nothin' on me, U got nothin' on me
I know who you are
Yeah, I see I should've known it from the start
You can't tell me lies
Don't even try 'cause,
This is goodbye

[Chorus:]
Now I know who you are
U got nothing on me, I see
I should've known it from the start
(U got nothing on me)
You can't tell me lies
Don't even try 'cause
This is goodbye, goodbye
