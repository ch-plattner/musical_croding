
There's an "S" under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see
I light up when the doors are closed
I am free, yeah
And I wish I could make my move
I can tell that you're really into me
And I don't got a thing to lose, in my dreams, in my dreams

I'm a bad ass, jumping off the moving train
I'm a Jane Bond, putting all the guys to shame
I'm a wild card, and I'm gonna steal your game
You better watch out

I'm a fire starter
Make your blood run faster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh whoa yeah yeah, oh oh
I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah, oh yeah

I might look all innocent
But the embers are burning inside of me
And I'm ready to take that step, can't you see, can't you see?

I'm a bad ass jumping off the moving train
I'm a Jane Bond, putting all the guys to shame
I'm a wild card, I'm about to take my aim
You better watch out, watch out

I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah

I'm so high, I'm burning up,
Kiss your lips, I'm waking up
There's nothing more to be afraid of

There's an "S" under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see

I'm a fire starter, make your blood run faster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah

I'm a fire starter
