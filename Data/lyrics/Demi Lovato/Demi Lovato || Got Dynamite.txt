
I can't take your hand and
Lead you to the water 
I can't make you feel what you don't feel 
But you know you wanna 
Find out how to crack me 
Log in try to hack me 

Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know 
And you might feel like you're drowning 
But that's what I need to let go 

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
Kick senseless, my defenses 
Tell me what you're gonna do 
I need you to light the fuse 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
You just might need dynamite 

Got dynamite?
Got dynamite?

I can't paint this picture 
Just so you can hang it 
I can't wait for you to understand 
If you just don't get it 
Find out how to crack me 
Log in try to hack me 

Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know 
And you might feel like you're drowning 
But that's what I need to let go 

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
Kick senseless, my defenses 
Tell me what you're gonna do 
I need you to light the fuse 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
You just might need dynamite 

When the walls come crashing down 
I hope you're standing right in front of me 
Where my past lies all around 
'Cause all you need to save me is to intervene
And make the walls come crashing down 

Got got dynamite 

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
Kick senseless, my defenses 
Tell me what you're gonna do 
I need you to light the fuse 
Tell me what you got to break down the walls 
You just might need dynamite 

Got dynamite?
Got dynamite?
Got dynamite?
Got dynamite?
