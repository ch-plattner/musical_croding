
You've got a face for a smile you know
A shame you waste it when you're breaking me slowly
But I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write you goodbye and that's when I know
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through

Oh, I'm going my own way
My faith has lost its strength again
Oh, it's been too hard to say
We've fallen off the edge again
We're at an end
We're at an end

Maybe you'll call me someday
Hear the operator say the number's no good
And that she had a world of chances for you
She had a world of chances for you
She had a world of chances
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through

You've got a face for a smile you know
