I saw you looking over
Now I see you moving this way
Pushing through the crowd
Like you got something to say, yeah

But you couldn't walk
Cause the music's taking over your feet
I can tell by your toes
That you're rocking to this beat

You gotta dance til you ache
Til you drop, til you break
Free your soul, let me see you shake
One by one we're stealing the stage
Here we come, so get out of our way

It won't be long til the summers gone
Get your party on, so we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on, so we'll scream it out loud
Yeah

I know your type and all the hype is going
Straight to your head
And everybody's stopping what their doing
Cause your face is turning red, yeah

Gotta learn how to move to the groove
Give in, or get out
Put your hands in the air, stand up
In your chair and shout

You're all dolled up with nowhere to go
You wanna get out and put on a show
There's nothing wrong with staying home
As long as you've got your radio

It won't be long til the summers gone
Get your party on, so we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on, so we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't ya be late
Get your party on, so we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on, so we'll scream it out loud

Dallas, Texas
Bring it home for me, baby

The little things that you do
From across the room
I see you sending me clues
There in the way you make me move

It won't be long til the summers gone
Get your party on, so we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on, so we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't ya be late
Get your party on, so we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on and scream it out loud

Get your party on
Get your, get your party on
(Scream it out loud)
Get your party on
Get your, get your party on

Let's do it again
