
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

I'd say hold up,
Broken out of nowhere, showed up
I'm in love,
This heist got me skipping a heart beat
I'm giving up

I wanna run, run, run away
In your getaway car, make a getaway

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want
Just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

Hey, stranger
I'm addicted to the danger of the touch
Now you're wanted
Better keep me as your hostage
Tie me up

I wanna run, run, run away
In your getaway car, make a getaway

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want
Just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up

Everybody get down
Get down on the floor, floor
Everybody get down
Nobody gets hurt, hurt

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want
Just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want
Just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
