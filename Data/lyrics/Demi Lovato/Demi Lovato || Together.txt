
Ohh-oh, ohh yeah

Remember love, remember you and me
Remember everything we shared
On this planet when we cared

Remember hearts, remember unity
Remember loving neighbours
Without expecting favours

Why be afraid to make an honest mistake?
If you acknowledge the pain
And you wanna change,
You can get through anything

Do you remember at all?
People walking hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Look at me, now look at you
Now look at me again
See, we're not so different

Look around, what do you see?
We're throwing things outside our window
We don't care to keep it clean

I had a dream â€“ beauty was only skin deep
And if we all just believe
Love is all we need;
Nothing else can set you free, yeah

Do you remember at all?
People walking hand-in-hand, hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again, can we feel love again?
Can you imagine it all, imagine it all?
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Singing, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh yeah

If we could throw away the hate
And make love last another day
Don't give up just for today
Life would be so simple

And they may talk about us
But they will never stop us
We'll keep singing

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, come on, we'll keep singing
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-yeah, whoa yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-ohh

Do you remember at all
People walking hand-in-hand, walking hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again
Can you imagine it all, imagine, yeah
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song
Together

Oh
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah
Hold your hand with your neighbours
Together, together
No, da, da-da-da
Ohh-yeah
Ohh
Come on and sing it with me
Looking at you, baby
Ohh
Oohh-ohh
