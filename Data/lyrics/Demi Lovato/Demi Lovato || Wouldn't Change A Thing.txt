[Demi (Joe):]
It's like, he doesn't hear a word I say
His mind is somewhere far away
And I don't know how to get there
It's like all he wants is to chill out
(She's way too serious)
Makes me wanna pull all my hair out
(She's always in a rush and interrupting)
Like he doesn't even care
(Like she doesn't even care)

[Demi + Joe:]
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

Like fire and rain (like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

[Joe:]
She's always trying to save the day
Just wanna let my music play
She's all or nothing
But my feelings never change
[Demi (Joe:)]
Why does he try to read my mind?
(I try to read her mind)
It's not good to psychoanalyze
(She tries to pick a fight to get attention)
That's what all of my friends say
(That's what all of my friends say)

[Demi + Joe:]
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

Like fire and rain (like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

[J:] When I'm yes, she's no
[D:] When I hold on, he just lets go
[J + D:] We're perfectly imperfect
But I wouldn't change a thing, no

Like fire and rain (Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a
Wouldn't change a thing
