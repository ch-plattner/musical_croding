
I don't know why, I don't know why I'm so afraid
I don't know how, I don't know how to fix the pain
We're livin' a lie, livin' a lie; this needs to change
We're out of time, we're out of time and its still the same

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said 'nobody has to know',
Give us time to grow, and take it slow
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone
Let us be alone

I'm hearing the noise, hearing the noise from all around
I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge of breaking down
Like Bonnie and Clyde, let's find a ride, and ditch this town
To keep it alive, keep it alive, don't make a sound

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said 'nobody has to know',
Give us time to grow, and take it slow
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone
Let us be alone
Never wanna take that final look
I'll turn another page, won't close the book

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said 'nobody has to know',
Give us time to grow, and take it slow
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone
Let us be alone
Let us be alone
(Let us be alone)
Let us be alone
