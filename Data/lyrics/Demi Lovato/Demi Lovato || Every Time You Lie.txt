You told me on a Sunday
That it wasn't gonna work
I tried to cry myself to sleep
'Cause it was supposed to hurt
We sat next to the fire
As the flame was burning out
I knew what you were thinking
Before you'd say it aloud

Don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not even breaking
You're not worth the time that this is taking

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars
You still love her I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie

(every time you lie, every time you lie)

I woke up the next morning
With a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen
Happy to take your place
Less trashier, much classier
Than who you prove to be
How long's it gonna take before
You see that she's no me

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars (oh no no)
You still love her I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie

At night awake
I will be sleeping 'til morning breaks
That's the price you pay for your mistakes
Goodbye to dreaming

So don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars (oh no no)
You still love her I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie
Every time you lie
(Don't say you're sorry, every time you lie)
Don't say you're sorry (oh)
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie
