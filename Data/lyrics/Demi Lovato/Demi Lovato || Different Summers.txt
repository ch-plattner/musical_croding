We're like a melody with no words
Until we figure it out
We sing la la la la, la la
I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked right until now
Cause up 'till now, yeah
Every day's been like a dream world, oh
But now you're not just in my head, oh no

Will we remember different summers?
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy, tails is harder to plan
If we start it all over again
And again and again, oh

You know I can't help but wonder
What's gonna happen next
I'm a little curious, oh yeah
Every stop that I stood under
When you were under it too
Did you ever think about us?
I hope you did cause I can tell you
That's something I'll never forget
I won't forget

Will we remember different summers?
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy, tails is harder to plan
If we start it all over again

Only friends, just beginning
But I hope that we find it again
So we can go from here, oh

Will we remember different summers?
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy, tails is harder to plan
If we start it all over again
Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again
Will we remember different summers?
