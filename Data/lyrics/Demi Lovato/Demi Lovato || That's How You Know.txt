
How does she know that you love her
How do you show her you love her
How does she know that you really really truly love her

It's not enough to take the one you love for granted
You must remind her or she'll be inclined to say

How do I know he loves me 
How do I know he's mine
Does he leave a little note to tell you you are on his mind
Send you yellow flowers when the sky is gray
He'll find a new way to show you
A little bit everyday
That's how you know
That's how you know he's your love

Everybody wants to live happily ever after
Everybody wants to know that your love is true

How do you know he loves you
How do you know he's yours
Does he take you out dancing just so he can hold you close
Dedicate a song with words meant just for you
He'll find his own way to tell you 
With the little things he'll do
That's how you know
That's how you know he's your love
He's your love

How does she know that you love her
How do you show her you love her
How does she know that you really really truly love her
That's how you know it's true

Because he'll wear your favorite color just so he can match your eyes
Set a private picnic by the fire glow, oh oh
His heart will be your's forever
Something everyday will show
That's how you know
That's how you know
That's how you know 
That's how you know he's your love
