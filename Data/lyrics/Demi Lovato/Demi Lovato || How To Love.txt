
Cut the music up, little louder, yeah 

See I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart 
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out 
How to love
How to love 

See I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now I'm in this corner tryna put it together
How to love 
How to love 

For a second you were here
Now you over there 
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body 
Like you never had my love 
How to love 

When I was just a young and my looks were so precious 
But now I'm grown up 
So fly it's like a blessing but I can't have a man look at me for five seconds 
Without me feeling insecure 
I never credit myself, so when I got older 
It's seems like I came back ten times over
Now I'm sitting here in this damn corner 
Looking through all my thoughts and looking over my shoulder 

See I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart 
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out 
How to love 
How to love 

See I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever 
Now I'm in this corner tryna put it together 
How to love 
How to love 

Ohh I had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
In fact then I saw the world effecting all my decisions
But it wasn't my fault 
Wasn't in my intentions 
To be the one there talking 
Be the one there listenin' 
See I don't mind your popping bottles and dippin' 
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping 
Baby, so don't be mad 
Nobody else tripping 
You see a lot of crooks but the crooks still crook 

See I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart 
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out 
How to love 
How to love 

Yeah, See I just want you to know 
That I deserve the best 
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful 
Yeah 

See I want you to know, I'm far from the usual 
Far from the usual 

I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out 
How to love 
How to love 

I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever 
Now I'm in this corner tryna put it together 
How to love
How to love 
Yeah Ooh yeah
How to love
mmm
