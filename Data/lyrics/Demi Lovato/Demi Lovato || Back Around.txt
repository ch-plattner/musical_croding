
What did I do to deserve this?
Tell me the truth and don't lie
You're pretty good at that but, no not this time
You walk around like you run the world,
Running your mouth, and talking about me now,
They think that you're the perfect girl,
There gonna see everything so get back

[Chorus:]
It's gonna come back around
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too tall to take this again
You're just too adverse but I got news
You know you're just gonna lose
Everything and everyone that mean so much to you.

I'm feeling bad for,
You are alone and nobody cares that you are
One look into your eyes,
Easy to see what you could be but you're not
I say it's time that you give in,
Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over
You feel your heart beat deep down
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain,
Just get out

[Chorus]

You keep hearing everything that people say
And you cant take the pain another day
It's coming back around
I told you this town was just too small

[End chorus:]
You're just too adverse but you can stop now
It's gonna come back around
And around and around and around and around
Yeah yeah
It's gonna come back around
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too tall (too tall)
To take this, take this again (whoa)
You're just too adverse but Ive got news
You know you're just gonna lose
Everything and everyone that mean so much to you
Everything and everyone that mean so much to you
Everything and everyone that mean so much to you.
