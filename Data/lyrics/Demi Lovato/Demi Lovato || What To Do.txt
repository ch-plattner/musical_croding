Tell me what to do about you
I already know I can see in your eyes
When you're selling the truth
'Cause it's been a long time coming
So where you running to?
Tell me what to do about you

You got your way of speaking
Even the air you're breathing
You could be anything
But you don't know what to believe in
You got the world before you
If I could only show you
But you don't know what to do

Tell me what to do about you
Something on your mind
Baby all of the time
You could bring down a room
Oh yeah
This day has a long time coming
I say it's nothing new
Tell me what to do about you

You got your way of speaking
Even the air you're breathing
You could be anything
But you don't know what to believe in
You've got the world before you
If I could only show you
But you don't know what to do

You think about it
Can you ever change?
Finish what you started
Make me want to stay
Tired of conversation
Show me something real
Find out what your part is
Play it how you feel

Tell me what to do, about you
Is there anyway, anything I can say
Won't break us in two
'Cause it's been a long time coming
I can't stop loving you
Tell me what to do about you

You got your way of speaking
Even the air you're breathing
You could be anything
But you don't know what to do believe in
You've got the world before you
If I could only show you
But you don't know what to do
Oooh
You could be anything
But you don't know what to believe in
World before you
Show you
But you don't know what to do
Yeah
