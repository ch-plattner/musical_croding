
I feel a seperation coming on 
'Cause I know you want to be moving on 
I wish it would snow tonight 
You'd pull me in, avoid a fight 
'Cause I feel a seperation coming on 
Just prove, that there's nothing left to try
'Cause the truth, I'd rather we just both deny 
You kissed me with those open eyes 
It says so much, it's no suprise
To you, but I've got something left inside

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember, December
We were so in love back then,
Now you're listening
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember, remember, December 
Please remember,
Don't surrender......

You said you wouldn't let them change your mind
'Cause when we're 
Together fire melts the ice 
Our hearts are both on overdrive
Come with me, let's run tonight 
Don't let these memories get left behind

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember, December
We were so in love back then,
Now you're listening
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember, remember, December 
Please remember,
Don't surrender......

I remember us together 
With a promise of forever 
We can do this, fight the pressure 
Please remember, December

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember, December
We were so in love back then,
Now you're listening
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember, remember, December 
Please remember,
Don't surrender......
