
We're done, but it's not over. We'll start it again
After the end of the day, it keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together.

Come on, come on, you know
It's your time to move it's my time to move
Come on, come on, let go
Leave it all behind, your past and mine

[Chorus]
Gone are the days of summer
We couldn't change it if we tried
Why would we want to, let's go where we got to
Out paths will cross again in time
It's never the same tomorrow,
And tomorrow is never clear

So come on, come on, you know
Our time, our time is here

We know, but were not certain
How can we be, how can we see what's ahead
The road keeps on turning
And all we can do, is travel each day to the next

Come on, come on, you know
It's your time to move it's my time to move
Come on, come on let go,
Leave it all behind, your past and mine

[Chorus]

Yeah

Gone are the days of summer
We couldn't change it if we tried
(if we tried)
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
So come on, come on you know
Our time... our time
Is here- yeah-oh
