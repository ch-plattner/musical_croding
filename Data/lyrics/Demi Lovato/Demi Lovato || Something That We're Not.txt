
I should've known when I got you alone
That you were way too into me to know
This isn't love, boy, this ain't even close
But you always think we're something that we're not

And now you call me every single night
I only answer 'cause I'm too polite
We happened once, or maybe it was twice
Yeah, you always make it hard for me to stop
But you always think we're something that we're not

Hey!

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop trying to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook-up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not

Hey!

I hear you're telling everyone you know
That I'm the one like you can't let me go
And you just keep on blowing up my phone
'Cause you never seem to know when you should stop

Don't introduce me to any of your friends
Delete my number, don't call me again
We had some fun, but now it's gonna end
But you always made it hard for me to stop
Now you always think we're something that we're not

Hey!

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop trying to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook-up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not

Hey!

Something that we're not
Hey!
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something that we'reâ€”

Not gonna happen, dude

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop trying to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook-up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not

Hey!

Something that we're not

You think we're something that we're not
Something that we're not
Something
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something that we're not
