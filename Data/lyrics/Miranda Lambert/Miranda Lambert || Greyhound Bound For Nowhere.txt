
Rain on the window makes me lonely
Time keeps on passing so slowly
The old man sittin' next to me is fallin' asleep
On a Greyhound Bound For Nowhere

The sun's going down on my misery
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That cell phone I hear ringing, I keep wishing it was you
On a Greyhound Bound For Nowhere

That ring that you were wearing don't mean everything
The way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

Bright lights of a city shining up ahead
My hearts analyzing every word you said
Did you take me for a fool or did you really care
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

That ring that you were wearing don't mean everything
The way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

I'm gonna find someplace I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride

Rain on the window and I'm still lonely
And time keeps on passing so slowly
You're with her and I'm alone and you're wishing I was there
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
We' re all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
