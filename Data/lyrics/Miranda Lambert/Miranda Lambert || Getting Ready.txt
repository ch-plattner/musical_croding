
Oh baby, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
My hands are shaking,
my heart's unsteady
Oh, how I once loved you so

I know all the magic's gone
Wish I had a magic wand
I would put a spell on you
You would sing it as I do

Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh baby, you're my drug
I was just your cigarette
I was nothing you could be proud of
I have lost my self respect
Self respect, self respect
I have lost my self respect

Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh baby baby, I got no traction
I've been waiting and waiting for your reaction
Sure I tried a new direction
I'm going to give myself a resurrection

I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,
I'm getting ready to let you go

I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,
I'm getting ready to let you go
