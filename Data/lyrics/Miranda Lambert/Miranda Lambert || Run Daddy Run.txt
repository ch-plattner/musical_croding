
Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

All the songs you used to sing to me
Would rock birds to sleep
I need you now so please somehow
Put rockets on your feet

Oh oh oh oh

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Saw that dark cloud coming from a million miles away.
Oh how I've dreaded this God forsaken day.

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Mama's been crying in the kitchen
Sister's been afraid of the dark.
I've been gathering the pieces of all these shattered hearts.
And I don't care where you go to
And I don't care where you land
But just get out of there daddy as fast as you can

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Run Daddy run, run daddy run.
Run Daddy run, run daddy run.
