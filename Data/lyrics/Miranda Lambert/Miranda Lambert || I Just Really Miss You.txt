There's a dark cloud hanging over my heart
I can't see where it ends, or where it starts.
I should get over you, but baby, it's so hard,
with this dark cloud hanging over my heart.

There's a sad song ringing in my head.      
Baby, it's been here ever since you left.
I should be moving along how far would I get
with this sad song ringing in my head.

[Chorus:]
I just really miss you, I just really miss you,
There's a life I can't ask you to leave.
I just really miss you, right now I kinda want to. 
The closest that you'll ever be to me
is free.

There's a hard wind blowing through this town.
And nothing left to hold is pushing me down.
It blows over you and me without a sound.
There's a hard wind blowing through this town.

[Chorus:]
I just really miss you, I just really miss you,
There's a life I can't ask you to leave.
I just really miss you, right now I kinda need to.
The closest that you'll ever be to me
is free.

Now it's one more night at the upside down,
it's ten steps in, and hundred miles back out.

[Chorus:]
I just really miss you, I just really miss you,
There's a life I can't ask you to leave.
I just really miss you, right now I kinda need to.
The closest that you'll ever be to me
is free.

There's a dark cloud hanging over my heart.....
