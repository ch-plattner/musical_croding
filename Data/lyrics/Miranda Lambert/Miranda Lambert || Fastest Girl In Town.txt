You’ve got the bullets
I’ve got the gun.
I’ve got a hankering for getting into something

I hit the bottle, you hit the gas,
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass.

I’m feeling frisky, you're feeling good
I guess the whiskey is doing what it should
I got the cigarettes
You’ve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down we’ll start a little fire

Ain’t no use in trying to slow me down
‘Cause you’re running with the fastest girl in town

Ain’t you baby?
I like ‘em crazy.

My reputation follows me around
Just makes me want to give them more to talk about
Let’s go to town for a little while
I’ll be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile

Ain’t no use in trying to slow me down
‘Cause you’re running with the fastest girl in town

Ain’t you baby?
You’re kinda crazy.

Come on!

I see the blue lights, we better run.
Throw out the bottle and I’ll hide the gun
If he pulls us over I’ll turn on the charm
You’ll be in the slammer and I’ll be on his arm.

Ain’t no use in trying to slow me down
‘Cause you’re running with the fastest girl in town

Ain’t you baby?
Well I told you I was crazy.
No I ain’t no body’s baby. 
Hey!

He’s got the bullets 
He’s got a gun
I got the hankering for getting into something.
