
I'm gonna drink till I feel pretty
I'm gonna laugh till you get mad
I'm gonna dance with three more strangers
Till you get over what you had

[Chorus]
I can feel you starin at me
And I just love good irony
The only shot you got's one more tequila
Cause I aint nobody's used to be

Its gettin late
A little lonely
And what you're thinkin's all to clear
Lucky for you I've had too many
I'm just drunk enough to leave you here

[Chorus]
I can feel you starin at me
And I just love good irony
The only shot you got's one more Jack Daniels
Cause I aint nobody's used to be

You can stop anticipatin 
Just go home I know she's waitin
And I know you'll be wishin it was me
Honey I ain't nobody's used to be
