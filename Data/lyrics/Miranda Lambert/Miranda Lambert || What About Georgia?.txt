
You draw it out like a highway
With every word that you say
Excuses for the answers that you lack
Your mama's still the steady ground you walk on every day
And your daddy's still the monkey on your back
Did you find all you thought you'd find out in the wild, wild west
You took a little piece of home and you threw away the rest

You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
Hey what about Georgia

Saw your sister yesterday
Austin's five and on his way
Looking for some shoes that he can fill
He said that he'd be just like you, the coolest guy he ever knew
And he'd find you when he lost his training wheels
I looked in his big blue eyes and I saw you again
He's hungry for a life that he aint ready to begin

You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
So what about Georgia

Guess you didn't realize it'd take you quite this long
To figure out that being free is right where you belong

You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
HEY! Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
Hey want about Georgia
What about Georgia yeah
What about Georgia Georgia Yeah
What about Georgia
