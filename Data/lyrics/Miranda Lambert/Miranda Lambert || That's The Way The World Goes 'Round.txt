She's a pretty nice lady, kinda confused
Got muscles in her head, ain't never been used
Thinks she owns half of this town

Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
She beats her old man with her panty hose
Then she takes him out, buys him new clothes
It's the way that the world goes 'round

That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round

I was sitting in the tub just counting my toes
When the radiator broke and the water froze
I got stuck in the ice without any clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown

I was crying ice cubes, hoping that I'd croak
When the sun come through the window and the ice all broke
I said "son of a gun", man, that's just a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round

That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
Got a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round

Well I said that's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
Got a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
