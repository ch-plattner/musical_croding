Time
It comes and goes like everything I know
It's just when I wish it would stand here still
It never will
Love
You find some, then it goes away again
You move on to the next
And by then you're just a mess
You gotta start all over again
Why does everybody want more love?

Am I the  only one that sees my point of view?
You can waste your life lookin' for somethin' to look forward to
And you  chase it
But when you catch it
What are you gonna do?

Independence
You say you're fine on your own but you come across cold
He don't feel like you need him so he goes
You're left here  alone
Why does everybody wanna be independent?

Am I the  only one that sees my point of view?
You can waste your life lookin' for somethin' to look forward to
And you  chase it
But when you catch it
What are you gonna do?

My every day seems like such bliss
But then in the end you wish someone would have told you all about
How it donâ€™t work out
Why does everybody wanna be so  naive?

Cuz you chase it
Then you waste it
What are you gonna do?
