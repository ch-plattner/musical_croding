Throw a dog a bone,
I'll take it if i have to
Go real fast like there's somewhere we can get to
What's the use of standing right there on the edge if there ain't nowhere to fall
What's the use in hanging on tight to the phone
If nobody might call

[Chorus:]
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
Complicated words slipping off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you

Tell it like a lie,
live it like a movie
Give a heart away like it don't mean nothing to me
What's the use in making all the plans that we made if you weren't gonna go
What's the use of slapping on a smile for a face if your eyes don't wanna show

[Repeat Chorus:]

Well it's too damn bad  you didn't have a chance to make me your best friend
You were too caught up in giving too much up and not doing what you should have been

[Repeat Chorus:]
