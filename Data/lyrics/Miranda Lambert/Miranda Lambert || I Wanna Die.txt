
You know it's so complicated, first you love then you hate it
Someone's laughing, someone's crying, someone livin', someone's dying
Sombody always looses and we still play the game
And the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die

You always say that you love me and there is no one above me
Never giving, always takin', never bending, always breaking
I know you aint a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin' on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die

Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools

Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing, you're crying, you're livin', I'm dyin'
Somebody always looses and we still play the game
Yeah the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die

Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools

Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing you're crying, I'm living, you're dyin'
I know you aint a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die
OHHHH I wanna die
Tear it up Tear it up
um um um
