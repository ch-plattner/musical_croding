Tongue is sharp
Got an ax to grind
Girls go wrong, men go right after them
I don't win and it's a compromise
You'll be the loser that pays the dividend

Far from you you'll find me
Such an easy target and a tragedy
You're just a shiver looking for a spine
You can have your way, but you can't have mine

If I had one wish you'd go away
I haven't snapped yet, but I'm on the brink of it
And I'm not as dumb as the look on your face
You'll never be half the man your mama is

Overloaded by the way you talk
A hairpin trigger that I can't stop
Empty words taking up my time
And you can have your way
But you can't have mine

'Cause every shot baby it feels like a resurrection
I'm looking for affection at the bottom of a bottle again
You show up and it starts another chain reaction
Oh but I can't tell if it's you or the drink
It's too hard to know
'Cause it hurts to think

Far from you you'll find me
Such an easy target and a casualty
You're just a shiver looking for a spine
You can have your way, but you can't have mine

'Cause every shot baby it feels like a resurrection
I'm looking for affection at the bottom of a bottle again
You show up and it starts another chain reaction
Oh but I can't tell if it's you or the drink
It's too hard to know
'Cause it hurts to think
Yeah it hurts to think
