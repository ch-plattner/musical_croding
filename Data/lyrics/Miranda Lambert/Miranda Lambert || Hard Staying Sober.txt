It’s hard staying sober when you ain’t staying over
It’s easy getting messed up on the truth
It’s hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It’s hard staying sober when I’m getting over you

It’s hard to the leave the house when all I think about
Is how hard it might be to come back home
I wait here and watch the rain when you come back for your things
You’ll get what you want and then you’ll go

It’s hard staying sober when you ain’t staying over
It’s easy getting messed up on the truth
It’s hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It’s hard staying sober when I’m getting over you

It’s hard to quit this smoking when my will to fight is broken
It’s hard to quit a habit in a rush
Hits me in the morning, just like you I’m looking for them
Can’t seem to put down this pick-me-up

It’s hard staying sober when you ain’t staying over
It’s easy getting messed up on the truth
It’s hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It’s hard staying sober when I’m getting over you

Why you think the world drinks?
Why you think the world smokes?
Why you think we all sit around and tell a bunch of dirty jokes?

Somebody somewhere is out having a ball 
And somebody’s laying around heartbroke

Why you think we all drink?
Why you think we all smoke?

Why you think we all drink?
Why you think we all smoke?
