Two kids from Tacoma
In a '72 Nova,
No pill and barely old enough to drink,
Learned the ropes and tested science,
Started pentecostal riots,
In just five minutes behind the rolling rink,
In the backseat brings

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it, then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till your eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah it's always in the water
Babies makin' babies

Between diplomas and the diapers,
They become couch quarter finders,
Savin' up for a Maytag microwave,
Oh but all has been forgiven,
On the day the water christen,
The best thing that could have happened by mistake,

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till your eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah it's always in the water
Babies makin' babies

Well it's a tried and true equation,
maintains a small town population,
Thats turns us all into a family,

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till you're eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah its always in the water,
Babies makin' babies

Yes it's always in the water,
Babies makin babies
