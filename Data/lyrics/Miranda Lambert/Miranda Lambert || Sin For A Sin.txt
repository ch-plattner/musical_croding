I remember vividly what that vision did to me 
You laying with her in our bed 
Love can be a tradgedy 
When you do what you did to me 
All I'm seeing now is red 

I need to repent 
A sin for a sin 

Bible told me to forget 
All those who trespass against 
Tread their feet on sacred ground 

Bad things come with consequence 
What feels good, hurts in the end 
Dont want to think about that now 

I need to repent 
A sin for a sin 

Fire and brimstone 
Dirt and a headstone 
Bury them, baby 
Along with your sins 
Hear the thunder 
Six feet under 
Hit your knees 
Wont do it again 

Guilty pleasure 
Ease the pain 
Whisky runnin through my veins 
Too late to save you now 

I need to repent 
A sin for a sin 

Fire and brimstone 
Dirt and a headstone 
Bury them deep 
Along with your sins 
hear the thunder 
Six feet under 
hit your knees 
wont do it again 

I remember vividly 
What that vision did to me
