Forgivers, no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the sign's flashing no vacancy

You've broken my heart for the last time
You promise the truth and you told lies
You've really made me believe
That love was supposed to be free

Love letters on wet paper
Forgivers, no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the signs flashing no vacancy

I'll never forget how he used to be
But I'm better off living with memories
I know that it's gonna hurt
But I don't think it gets any worse

And love letters on wet paper
Forgivers, no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the sign's flashing no vacancy

Yeah, my heart's flashing no vacancy
