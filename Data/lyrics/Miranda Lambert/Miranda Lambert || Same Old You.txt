
So here you are
In your borrowed car
Kicking rocks around
Looking at your shoes
It's the same old you

Tell me where you been
And where you're going to
Where were you last night
Boy listen up when I'm talking to you
It's the same old you

Another lonely night
With that same old whiskey morning

It's the same old you
When you get to drinking
The same old you
When you're on the town
The same old you
In church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down

Well this time I done some thinking
And I think I'm done with you
Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too

Well your mama's gonna cry her eyes
There ain't gonna be no wedding day
What's she gonna say?
When I tell her how I had no choice
The same old you couldn't even raise your voice
And ask me to stay
I wouldn't anyway

So you can keep your ring
And I'll keep my daddy's name

It's the same old you
When you get to drinking
The same old you
When you're on the town
The same old you
In church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down

This time I done some thinking
And I think I'm done with you
Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too

Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too
