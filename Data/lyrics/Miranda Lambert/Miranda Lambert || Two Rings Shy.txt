Ain’t gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain’t wastin’ good mascara just to watch it runnin’ down
I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

I could spend an hour on my make-up and my hair
Shoes too tall, dress too small and lacy underwear
Go down to the bar, buy myself a drink
Dangle there all perfect, like a puppet on a string

I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Ain’t gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain’t wastin’ good mascara just to watch it runnin’ down
I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

You got girls that sing and dance, I hear one's an acrobat
You got ‘em swinging from the chandelier, well, honey I don’t swing like that
The main attraction’s leaving, let the sideshow pay the rent
Take this diamond back, and you'll be two rings shy of the big top tent

I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Ain’t gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain’t wastin’ good mascara just to watch it runnin’ down
I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Tiptoe ‘cross the tightrope, 'til you turn me upside down
Cut the cable, pull the net just to let me hit the ground
I ain’t gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
