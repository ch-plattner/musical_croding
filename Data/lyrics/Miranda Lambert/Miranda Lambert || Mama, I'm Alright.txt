
Well the sun just got through going down on a sleepy little Texas town
Population plus one minus one
A new grandma rocks my sister's kid just like twenty years ago she did
The same thing in that same chair
She said "this one's born to run"

Every day at noon like a chapel bell find her Jesus keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong at the end of the day
I got 5 good years and a tank of gas, fifty watts and Johnny Cash
A guitar and a broken heart just full of things to say
You taught me how to stand those tests and trials
But you can't se a desert sunrise in the bible

She loves me more that anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped of in El Paso,
And her north in Abilene
Mama I'm OK out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be

If I'd have done what you and daddy done, would have never lost and never won
Or gotten myself kicked when I was down
I would not know how to travel well, A hundred bucks and cheap motels
I would not know how to fight for my own heart next time around

Now don't you cry another night about me
In this city I've got angels all around me

She loves me more that anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped of in El Paso
And her north in Abilene
Hey Mama I'm OK out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed Id be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be

I felt it every time you prayed for me
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
