
I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore

It's not like I don't have tears to cry
Such memories so little time
This box of photographs to go through one by one
There's just so much work to get done

I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore

When you skipped town I was such a mess
So I found some things to do instead
Trick is to find something to occupy your mind
Now I spend most days chasin' mine

And I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you, I'm cuddling up to kiss you
And I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore
