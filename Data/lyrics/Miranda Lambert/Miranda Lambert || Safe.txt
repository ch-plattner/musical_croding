
Just like the fringe on my boots
You move with every step I take
You walk in front of me to make sure 
That I don’t fall and break my own heart
Cause with you I could never

Just like the leather on my saddle
We get prettier with time
Together in the weather
Shiny on the other side
Polished and changed for the better

With you I’m safe
With you I’m safe

I follow you just like a shadow
Only closer and
If you get tied and bound
I'll find a way to free your hands
I'll wash them clean
Of everything but me

Sometimes you might get thirsty
So I’ll catch the rain
Just like the ice in your glass
I'll rattle when you need a drink
You’ll never run dry of love or anything

I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe

I keep a locket on my neck that holds your face
I’ll spend forever making sure I can erase
Every tear you ever thought about crying

You make me feel like I’m the only girl in the whole wide world
I wanna hold you like a handful of diamonds and pearls
That I guard with my life or die trying

I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
