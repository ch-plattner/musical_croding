
I feel like the 
flowers in this vase,
He just brought em' 
home one day,
"Ain't they beautiful"
he said.
They've been here in
the kitchen and the
water's turnin' grey.
They're sittin' in 
the vase but now 
they're dead.
Dead flowers.

I feel like this 
long string of lights.
They lit up our whole
house on christmas day.
But now it's January
and the bulbs have
all burned out,
But still they hang.
Like dead flowers.

He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the 
sting of this rain. 
I'm livin' in a hurricane.
All he can say is, 
"Man ain't it such a nice day"
Yeah, Yeah. 

I feel like the
tires on this car. 
They said we won't go far
but we're still rollin'
I look in the rear view
and I see dead flowers in the yard
and that string of lights.
But and it ain't glowin'
Like dead flowers.
Like dead flowers. 

He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the 
sting of this rain.
I'm drivin' through a hurricane.
All he can say is, 
"Man ain't it such a nice day"
Hey, hey I guess we'll just
go to waste, like dead flowers.

Like dead flowers.
Dead flowers.
