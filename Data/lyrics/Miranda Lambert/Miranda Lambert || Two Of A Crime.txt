Red ros√© on painted lips.
Putting on Chanel, packing parliaments.
Side by side like fuzzy dice.
If looks could kill we'd be doing time.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.

Wherever gets that contraband and southern charm, go hand in hand.
Fooling all the federales.
Shoot in tequila, hiding the bodies.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.
Yeah, two of a crime.
