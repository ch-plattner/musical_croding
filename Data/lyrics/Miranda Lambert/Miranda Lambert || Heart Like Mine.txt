
I ain't the kind you take home to mama 
I ain't the kind to wear no ring 
Somehow I always get stronger 
When I'm on my second drink 

Even though I hate to admit it 
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes 
The Christian folks say I should quit it 
And I just smile and say "God Bless" 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine 

Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo 
But said he loved me anyway 
My brother got the brains of the family 
So I thought I'd learn to sing 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine 

I'll fly away from it all one day 
And I'll fly away 
These are the days that I will remember 
When my names called on a roll 
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses 
And make a toast to me coming home 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand 
Understand a heart like mine 
Oh yes He would
