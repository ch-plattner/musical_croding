
My neighbor’s car got stolen last night
Right out of his driveway
We heard the dogs barking 
We never paid them any mind
And Mary say’s she’s going to lock the door 
From now on when we go away 
I’ve been walking around this farm
Wondering if it’s time

Time to get a gun 
That’s what I’ve been thinking 
I could afford one 
If I did just a little less drinking 
Time to put something
Between me and the sun
When the talking is over
It’s time to get a gun 

Last week a government man was there
When I walked out my back door
 He said I’m sorry to bother you ma’am
It don’t matter anymore 
Cause even while we were talking 
Right here where we stand
They’re making plans for a four way highway
And a big old over pass 

Time to get a gun 
That’s what I’ve been thinking 
I could afford one 
If I did just a little less drinking 
Time to put something
Between me and the sun
When the talking is over
It’s time to get a gun 

Mary says she’s worried about herself and her kids
She’s never known anybody who had a gun 
And her daddy never did 
But I think it should be up to me 
Cause when it’s all said and done
Somebody’s gotta walk into the night
And I’m going to be that one 

Time to get a gun 
That’s what I’ve been thinking 
I could afford one 
If I did just a little less drinking 
Time to put something
Between me and the sun
When the talking is over
It’s time to get a gun 

When the party is over 
It’s time to get a gun
