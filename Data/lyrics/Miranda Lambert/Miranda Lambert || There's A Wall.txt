
I'd run away but I can't escape the power of your pride
Your eyes are cold like an empty soul and I'm burning up inside
There's nothing wrong with letting go and you're still diggin' in
We're racing to the bottom and I' can't find the end

And there's a wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there a wall

You love me when you want to and you find reasons to fight
Another lame excuse to keep the devil on you side
Trying hard to hide those scares that I've already seen
Your beat up heart's not the only thing that's keeping you from me

And there's a wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there a wall

Pain has made you weak and hard
I will never be as strong,

As strong...
As this wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall
With this wall
