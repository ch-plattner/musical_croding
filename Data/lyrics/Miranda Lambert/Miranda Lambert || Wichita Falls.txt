
Alone in a booth, in the Pioneer Cafe 
I'm strung out from the road, a pillow in my hands
I sip the last straw from a cold cup of coffee
and try to sort out my feelings as good as I can
Two hours behind me there’s a boy back in Dallas
my phone will be ringing his afternoon call
but he'll get no answer, the queens left her palace
She’s alone in a cafe in Wichita Falls

Back out on the highway towards Oklahoma 
I'm driving and crying and hating it all
This old Chevrolet is raising the sunset
and taking me further from Wichita Falls

I don’t know where I'm going I have no direction
and all I can say is I've made up my mind
I just want to travel a long way from heartache
wherever it takes me I'll leave it behind
I guess that he thought I would stay there forever 
living my life with my back to the wall
Well maybe the waitress will send him that letter 
I left on the table in Wichita Falls
I'm going somewhere other than Texas
a long way from Dallas in Wichita Falls

I'm taking the highway yeah I'm going somewhere
