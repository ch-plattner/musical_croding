
Daddy always said he was wrong for me
And in the end he'd only bring me misery
I tried and tried to turn away
But something bout him makes me stay
The only man who's ever knocked me to my knees
The only man who's ever set my spirit free

He was born and raised in Lynchburg, Tennessee
His daddy owns a big distillery
He's an old time whiskey drinker
When I'm with him I get meaner
And momma says he's ruined my destiny
He sure has made a women out of me

I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
He's the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please
He always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again

I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
He's the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please
He always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again

Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been
That didn't do me wrong

Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain, its drivin' me insane
Since my baby's gone
