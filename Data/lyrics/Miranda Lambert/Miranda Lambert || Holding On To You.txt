I've seen the south of France
I've seen the sunset dance
Over Sunset Avenue
I've seen the Rolling Stones
Got real high on rock and roll
Seen a lot of dreams come true
But ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
That never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

I've seen a newborn child
Puts stars in her mama's eyes
And i pray to the man in the moon
I got drunk with the highway men
Felt the burn of the desert wind
Seen some promising I-dos
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
That never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, we just rolled in
It's cold here in Michigan
Got a sold-out show tonight
Pretty soon we'll hit the stage
I'll feel the lights hit my face
We'll see some magic in the room
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

No, no, no, no

Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
