I put a bullet in my radio 
Something just hit me funny I don’t know
Just pulled the trigger going down the road 
You slam the door and knock me off the wire 
Then walk in lines and you been burning tires
Slow and easy ain’t that what you like? 

It’s insane it’s in vain
You stay to maintain the pain 

I hear your name and then it burns a hole
I swear I hate you but I can’t let go 
The kind of feelings that you can’t console 

It’s in all vain it’s all insane 
I swear you’ll stay 
I swear you’ll stay to maintain the pain

It’s all in vain it’s all insane 
I swear you’ll stay
I swear you’ll stay to main the pain

Maintain the pain
