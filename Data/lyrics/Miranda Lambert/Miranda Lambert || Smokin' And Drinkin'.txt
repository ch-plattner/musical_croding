It was one of those times when a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hangin’ with friends, goin’ against our upbringin’, smokin’ and drinkin’

It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn’t know quite what to do
We were goin’ along with what was goin’ on, sayin’, "I think I love you."
And I think about us now every time that I go out smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ gets ya thinkin’ about the one that got away
Here’s to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin’ and drinkin’

We were livin’ it up sayin’ this town sucks so we painted it on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we're gonna miss
But damn we know it now cause it's all we talk about smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ gets ya thinkin’ about the one that got away
Here’s to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ gets ya thinkin’ about the one that got away
Here’s to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ gets ya thinkin’ about the one that got away
Here’s to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin’ and drinkin’

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Smokin’ and drinkin’
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Smokin’ and drinkin’
