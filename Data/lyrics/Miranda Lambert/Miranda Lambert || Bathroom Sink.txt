
Puttin' on my makeup
Puttin' off the hard stuff
Hopin' that it passes
Fake smile & eyelashes
I wash my hands and try not to think
Or dirty up my bathroom sink

I'm at it again with mama
Everybody's so tired of the drama
We're still fightin' like I'm sixteen
And I guess we always will be
She taught me how to pray and drink
And how to clean the bathroom sink

[Chorus:]
It's amazin', the amount of rejection
That I see in my reflection
And I can't get out of the way
I'm lookin' forward to the girl I wanna be
But regret has got a way of starin' me right in the face
So I try not to waste too much time
At the bathroom sink

It all gets complicated
And sometimes overrated
Glamour at it's finest
Just means someone's hidin'
From their own reality
And the mirror at their bathroom sink

[Chorus:]
It's amazin', the amount of rejection
That I see in my reflection
And I can't get out of the way
I'm lookin' forward to the girl I wanna be
But regret has got a way of starin' me right in the face
So I try not to waste too much time
At the bathroom sink

I pray as I get ready
For God to make me steady
And I thank Him for His patience
And I take my medication
And bless this day and all it brings
And I clean up the bathroom sink
