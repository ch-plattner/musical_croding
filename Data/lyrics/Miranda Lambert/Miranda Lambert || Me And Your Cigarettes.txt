Gives you something you can do with your hands
Makes you look cool and feel like a man
In the morning you will probably regret me 
Me and your cigarettes 

Started young it’s too late to quit
Most call it a bad, bad habit 
Your mama told you, you could end up dead 
With me, me and your cigarettes 

Always there every time you need me 
It ain’t love but just like nicotine 
You’re addicted to a feeling you can only get 
From me and your cigarettes 

Light us up and then throw us down 
Walk away when we hit the ground 
How they going to feel when you come back around here and see
It’s just you and your cigarettes 

Always there every time you need me 
It ain’t love but just like nicotine
You’re addicted to a feeling you can only get
From me and your cigarettes
