Old timers, "there in a pinch",
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Splittin' logs, smokin' hogs
Feedin' leftovers to a three legged dog,
I'm a fan of it, old shit

One man's trash is another man's treasure,
One man's pain is another man's pleasure,
If it's out of style, sure drives me wild
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Old turntables, vinyl records
Hand me down tools, Black and Decker
I'm a fan of it, old shit

One man's trash is another man's treasure,
One man's pain is another man's pleasure,
If it's out of style, sure drives me wild
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Singin' hymns, skippin' stones
When I think of him I think of home,
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Now Grandpa's trash is my treasure
He don't feel pain only pleasure
If it's out of style, sure drove him wild
So I'm a fan of it, old shit
Yeah I'm a fan of it, old shit
