I got red dirt stains
On my boots and jeans
Calloused fingers
From my guitar strings
Wild like the wind
In the tall pine trees
I got roots
And I got wings

I raise my glass
On a Saturday night
I thank the Lord above
On my Sunday drive
For Daddyâ€™s hands
And Mama's dreams
He gave me roots
She gave me wings

He said run on love
And run on life
And plant some seeds 
Until you're tired
Don't take anything at all for granted

She said raise your hands 
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever wanna be

He said run on love
And run on life 
And plant some seeds 
And take your time
Don't take anything at all for granted

She said raise your hands 
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever wanna be

I saddle up
When I get down
Sing every night
In a different town
And I've got a man who wears my ring
And I got roots
And I got wings
Yeah I got roots
I got wings
