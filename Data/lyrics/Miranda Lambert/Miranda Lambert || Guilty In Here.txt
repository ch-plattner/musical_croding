
God knows I tried everything I could
To stay inside tonight
But that boy's like a sore in your mouth
That you just have to bite
This number one is shakin' hands
With numbers two and three
Is it guilty in here or is it just me

I made a point of not mixin'
Love and pleasure in my life
Daytime boys and nightime boys
Usually don't see eye to eye
But I've been on a roll of late
And they're all on their knees
Is it guilty in here or is just me

What became of all the boys
Who only want one thing
Will someone tell me what I'm doin' wrong

'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings
And the young ones are just too dumb
I don't think I have any more
Room underneath my thumb
Maybe after all the ends do justify the means
Is it guilty in here or is it just me

[Chorus]

'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings
And the young ones are just too dumb
I don't think I have any more
Room underneath my thumb
Maybe after all the ends do justify the means
Is it guilty in here or is it just me
Is it guilty in here, maybe it's just me
