I was standing there crying in the kitchen 
It's been one of those mornings that's gonna last all day 
And he comes in, wraps his arms around me 
And I don't even have to say a thing 

That's what makes it love 
That's what makes it a love song 

He comes in, slams the door behind him 
And he can't hide the worry on his face 
Even though I got a million things to tell him 
I know right now he just needs some space 

That's what makes it love 
That's what makes it a love song 
That's what makes it love 
That's what makes it a love song 

Everybody always sings about it 
How they're never gonna live without it 
We don't even have to talk about it 
'Cuz We're livin it out 

That's what makes it love 
That's what makes it a love song 
That's what makes it love 
That's what makes it a love song
