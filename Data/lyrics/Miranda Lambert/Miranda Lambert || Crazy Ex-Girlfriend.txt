
It took me 5 bars, some 30 license plates
I saw her mustang
And my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol but I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in barehanded
She was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do
She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex girlfriend

I watched her for awhile but I didn't like her walk
She came across kinda cheap to me
But hey hows that my fault
She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl
To step up to that plate
I wanna Pitch
Little Bitch

Well those pretty girls can play their game
But their damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend

Well I started throwing things and
I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face and smelled whiskey on his breath
I Didn't give it a second thought to being thrown in jail
Well baby to a hammer everything looks like a nail
And I was mad as hell

Well those pretty girls they're all the same
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend

I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend
