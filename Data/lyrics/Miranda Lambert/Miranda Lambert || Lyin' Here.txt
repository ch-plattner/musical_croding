I love you more than you’ll ever know
And I’ll miss you more than I care to show
I’ll get better at pretending nothing’s wrong
Its easy when you’re always all alone
But lately I see leaving in your eyes
So nothing you say will come as a surprise
You don’t even have to try to be sincere
Just go on and leave me lyin’ here

And I’ll tell my heart you didn’t cause it to break
And I’ll tell my mind that I’m the one who made the mistakes
And I’ll tell my eyes they don’t even have to cry one tear
Just go on and leave my lyin’ here

So go on and find you someone new
I’ll make sure that I end up the fool
Maybe someday I’ll begin to make it clear
You’re the one who left me lyin’ here

And I’ll tell my heart you didn’t cause it to break
And I’ll tell my mind that I’m the one who made the mistakes
And I’ll tell my eyes they don’t even have to cry one tear
Just go on and leave my lyin’ here

Just walk away dear and leave me lyin’ here
