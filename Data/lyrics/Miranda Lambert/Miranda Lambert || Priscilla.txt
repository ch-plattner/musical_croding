We look we got it made, don't we?
Permanent accessory
On their arms and always on their minds
Rings, we gotta wear the real big rings
Big smiles like figurines
Big hair for the real big kind
When they turn it on and slick back their hair
We turn around and the world's right there
Woman to woman, I'm starting to see
What happened to you is happening to me

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man?
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla

Golden gate, we have to put up a gate
To find time to procreate
Or at least that's what we read
Bodyguard, Didn't know I was his bodyguard
And I shouldn't have to play the part
At least while we're not in bed
You and me share a unique position
Married to a man who's married to attention
Couldn't think of anybody better to ask
How to be the first to make it last?

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla

Cause when they turn it on and slick back their hair
We turn around and the world's right there
Woman to woman, I'm starting to see
What happened to you is happenin' to me

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home, a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla
