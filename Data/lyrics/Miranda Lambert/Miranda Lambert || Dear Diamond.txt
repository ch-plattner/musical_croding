Dear diamond
Pretty and new
Perfectly flawless too good to be true
Dear diamond
You shine like the sun
Wrap around my finger just like he does

You cost more than he wanted to lose
And with this ring I said I do
Promised to never do what I’ve done
I’ve been lying to someone

Dear diamond
What will we do?
Lie like the devil or just face the truth
Dear diamond
Be my saving grace
What he don’t know will kill him
That I can’t face

You cost more than he wanted to lose
And with this ring I said I do
I promised to never do what I’ve done
I’ve been lying to someone
Dear diamond

Dear diamond
With your band of gold
Some people you have, some people you hold
Dear diamond
I promise to keep
This secret I have while he’s holding me
