
If I ever left this town 
I'd never settle down 
I'd just be wanderin' around 
If I ever left this town 

If I wasn't by your side 
I'd never be satisfied 
Nothin' would feel just right 
If I wasn't by your side 

'Cause I'm not easy to understand 
But you know me like the back of your hand 
I'm your girl and you're my man 
And we're makin' plans.... 

We can go on and on 
Won't ever feel too long 
I'll always call you home 
And we'll go on and on 

'Cause I know you like the back of my hand 
Got a heart of gold and a piece of land 
I'm your girl and you're my man 
And we're makin' plans....
