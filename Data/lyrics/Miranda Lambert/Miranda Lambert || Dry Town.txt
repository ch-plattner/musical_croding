
Well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
Good hundred miles between me and Missoula
That vinyl top wasn't gettin' no cooler
I stopped at a quickie sack
Well I figured I'd need about a sixth of Miller
And one of those things so I wouldn't spill 'er
I asked the girl if the beer was in the back
She said

It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town

So I turn right around, no hesitation
Cursed the law for ruinin' the nation
Waved goodbye to the boy at the station
But she wouldn't go in gear

He said it sounds like your transmission
You need Bob, but he's gone fishin'
His day off, he gets a long way from here
Cause

It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town

Well back home friends you can get a dose of
Something strong from your local grocer
So I walked down 'til I got a little closer
To a place called Happy Johns

He said I keep something here for colds and fevers
Down underneath where I usual leave her
Just last night I felt a cold coming on

It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town
