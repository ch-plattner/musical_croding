
Carrying the weight on the end of a limb 
your just waitin for somebody 
to pick you up again 
shaded by a tree, can't live up to a rose 
all you ever wanted 
was a silent place to grow 

Pretty little thing 
sometimes you gotta look up 
and let the world see 
all the beauty that your made of 
cause the way you hang you head 
nobody can tell 
your my Virginia bluebell 
my Viginia bluebell 

Even through the snow 
a flower can bloom 
you just need a little push 
spring is coming soon 
umbrella in the rain 
they'll roll off your back 
better watcha can realize what you have 

Pretty little thing 
sometimes you gotta look up 
and let the world see 
all the beauty that your made of 
cause the way you hang you head 
nobody can tell 
your my Virginia bluebell 
my Viginia bluebell 

Put a little light in the darkest places 
put a little smile on the saddest faces 

Pretty little thing 
sometimes you gotta look up 
and let the world see 
all the beauty that your made of 
cause the way you hang you head 
nobody can tell 
your my Virginia bluebell 
my Viginia bluebell
