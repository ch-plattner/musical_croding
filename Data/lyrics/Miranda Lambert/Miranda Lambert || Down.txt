
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'

Strong man lived in a jackson hole
Took my heart and he broke my soul
Left a dark place in my chest
I sleep but I don't rest
I sleep but I don't rest

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'

Met a little boy in Baton Rouge
His eyes were clear and his heart was true
Made the boy's heart scream my name
But he didn't know the game
No he didn't know the game

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'
Yeah...
Hey
You don't want to be standin' there
When the storm hits you won't have a prayer
My wind will blow you to your knees
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me

Oooo yeah yeah

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
