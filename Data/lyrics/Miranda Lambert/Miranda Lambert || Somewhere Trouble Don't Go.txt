
Devil had a daughter 
Took him to deep water 
Tried to kill him with a kiss
He said hey now honey
What about the money 
I said I ain’t got time for this 

Take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
Make me make me someone trouble don’t know 

He said baby come inside 
I said sorry I got to ride
Sorry but I got to ride 
You know you could end up dead 
For sleeping in the devil’s bed
Sleeping in a devil’s bed

Take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
Make me make me someone trouble don’t know 

Baby wants to drive my car
But he wants to go too far
But he wants to go too far
First comes love and it’s so fine
Then comes heartache right behind
Then comes heartache behind 
My baby used to be so sweet
Now he won’t come down my street
Now he won’t come down my street 
All my plans got derailed 
He locked up my heart in jail
He locked up my heart in jail

Take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
Make me make me someone trouble don’t know
Take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go 
Make me make me someone trouble don’t know
