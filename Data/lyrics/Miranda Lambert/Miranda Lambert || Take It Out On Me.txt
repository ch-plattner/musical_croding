These are the last words that I'll say to you
You know damn well what brought it on
I can't believe I've been a silly fool
To let it go on this long

You never let life get you down
'Cause every single time
You take it out on me

You kick and scream your dyin' love for me
Well, you don't win love in a fight
The place you really need some victory
Is by yourself alone at night

I left my picture on the bed
So someone could be right
Take it out on me

Take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

You treated me like I was second hand
Somehow I always caught the blame
You'll never guess what I've been catchin' now
A better man with a better name

You're left out in the rain again
You can walk home in my shoes
Take it out on me

Ooh, take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

Ooh, take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

Take it out on me
