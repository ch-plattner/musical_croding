Highway 65 sure sounds kinda nice
I feel like drivin' somewhere far away
Got the top rolled down, radio up loud
Playin Willie and Old Hank

Well I don't really have a certain destination
I'll just fill the gas tank up and use my imagination

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

Sometimes we're afraid to change, scared of what tomorrow brings
Same routine every day
If you never stop and listen, you don't know what you'll be missin'
Don't let your life slip away

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about.
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

Stay up all night and sleep all day and wake up with a smile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while
