
Imagine a fighter with a centerfold face
Comes from a long line of blue collars and lace
With a grip like reins to a steed
And kisses for days
And imagine a winner holding pink champagne
Who still loves her daddy but changes her name
An overachiever, even she don't believe her own fame

You can't change her mind
(Even if you wanted to)
You can always try
(She'll see through to you, she'll see through you)
If you think you're the only one she'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' 'bout girls

Imagine your best friend and your worst enemy
Begs you to stay and then wishes you'd leave
Like Marilyn Monroe she can be who you want her to be

You can't change her mind
(Even if you wanted to)
You can always try
(She'll through to you, she'll see through you)
If you think you're the only one she'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' 'bout girls

Go on, go on
Give her everything and more
Love her all you want
She was never yours

You can't change her mind
You can always try
If you think you're the only one
She'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' about girls
If you think you're the only one
She'll want in this world
then you don't know nothing
No nothing
'bout girls.
