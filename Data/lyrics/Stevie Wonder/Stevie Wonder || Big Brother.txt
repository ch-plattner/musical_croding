Your name is big brother 
You say that you're watching me on the tele, 
Seeing me go nowhere, 
Your name is big brother, 
You say that you're tired of me protesting, 
Children dying everyday, 
My name is nobody 
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door 

Your name is big brother 
You say that you got me all in your notebook, 
Writing it down everyday, 
Your name is I'll see ya, 
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres, 
The President of your soul 
I live in the ghetto, 
You just come to visit me 'round election time 

I live in the ghetto, 
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side, 
My name is secluded, 
we live in a house the size of a matchbox, 
Roaches live with us wall to wall, 

You've killed all our leaders, 
I don't even have to do nothin' to you 
You'll cause your own country to fall
