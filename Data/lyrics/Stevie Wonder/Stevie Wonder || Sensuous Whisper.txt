
I've seen you, I saw you, I see you
without little notice, if any at all
Of you knowing me watchin you
You walking, you talking, you smiling
You styling in everything your body wears
And that's not just a point of view
They're painting, they're ranting, they're raving
About Miss Lovely got it going on
From head down to her toes
And no one knows better than I know
Cause I've been listening to the spirit of
Your body, mind and soul

It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper 
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper 
That makes my psyche say
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

Can feel you, can smell you, can taste you
Though my senses never had the pleasure of
That lovely wonderment
But I start to shaking, I shiver, to think that little sparkle in your eye
Means you are giving me some kind of hint
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm able
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue
Eagerly waiting for me to say
Then you smile and whisper "how are you?"
But when I move my lips and try to speak the words just go away

It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper 
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper 
That makes my psyche say
Ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

It's that sensuous whisper that's got me trippin out
It's that sensuous whisper
That I don't wanna do without
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me want to shout
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

I don't even care how long it takes
As long as I have you lying next to me
Cause to wait forever and a day
Is a small price to pay if it's you I'm getting
If it's you I'm getting, I'm not quitting
And that is how I'm living

I'm clinging, not dreaming, but scheming
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize
I think it, I trust it, I know it
Your love that I've longed for is gonna be mine
Good things do come in time
I'm right on the rythm you're givin
But this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy
The music, the candles, the champagne and all that's needed
Is one thing to give it authenticity

It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper 
That makes my psyche say
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

It's that sensuous whisper 
That's got me trippin out
It's that sensuous whisper
That I don't wanna do without
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me want to shout
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body rock
It's that sensuous whisper 
That makes me beg baby don't ever stop
It's that sensuous whisper 
That always get me hot, baby
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

It's that sensuous whisper 
That makes me feel alright
It's that sensuous whisper
That keep me wanting you morning, noon and every single night
It's that sensuous whisper
Don't want you out of my sight, baby
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

It's that sensuous whisper [repeat]
