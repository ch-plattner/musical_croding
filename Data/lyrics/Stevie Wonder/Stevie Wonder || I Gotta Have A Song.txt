
Got no place to be
No one's needing me
My girl just said we're through
Love was here to stay
Only yesterday
Today my world is blue

So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song

Had a happy home
Now it's turned to stone
Kitchen's cold and bare
She'd cook all day for me
I still hurry home to see
But I know that she's not there

So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song

Show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music, I just can't go wrong
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song
[Repeat]
