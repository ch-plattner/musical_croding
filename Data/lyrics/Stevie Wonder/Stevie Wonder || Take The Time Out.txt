
Lying out on the street, there's a man
That needs somewhere to sleep
And a bag-lady digs, through the trash
Hoping to find some food to eat
In the cold winter's snow, walks a boy
That needs shoes for his feet
In an old run-down house, there's a child
In a crib that needs some heat
In the dark of the night, a young man
Searches for a guiding light
And a young woman cries in despair
Cause she feels alone in life
You might ask yourself what in the hell
Does that have to do with me
Well, here is your wake up call...
"Everything!"
Cause we all play a part in each other's existence

Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone

There's a man in a house where they're selling crack
Yet he's trying to be strong
But when lost in the sea, of no hope
He must be saved from wrong
Don't say what you won't do, if for days
You had no food to eat
Nor extremes you won't go, for a bed, shoes
Or if your baby needed heat
You do not have the right to pre-judge

If you don't share your strength

And you can't say you're down for the fight
If you won't go the length
Now I don't really care what you feel
If you don't feel for life
And don't care what you think if your words
Don't have ways and actions that perpetuate life

Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone
[Repeat]

I think it's time to...

Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone
[Repeat]
