Seize upon that moment long ago 
One breath away and there you will be 
So young and carefree 
Again you will see 
That place in time...so gold 

Steal away into that way back when 
You thought that all would last forever 
But like the weather 
Nothing can ever...and be in time 
Stay gold 

But can it be 
When we can see 
So vividly 
A memory 
And yes you say 
So must the day 
Too, fade away 
And leave a ray of sun 
So gold 

Life is but a twinkling of an eye 
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion 
though not imagined 
All things that happen 
Will age too old 
Though gold
