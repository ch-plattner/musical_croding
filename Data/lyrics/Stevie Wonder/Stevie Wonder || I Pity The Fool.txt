
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool...
