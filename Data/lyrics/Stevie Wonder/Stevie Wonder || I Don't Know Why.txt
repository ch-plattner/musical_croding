
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule
I don't know why I love you 
But I love you 
Oh you never stop your 
Cheatin ways with another guy 
You laugh in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced
Cause I love you 
Oh baby, baby, baby
I don't know why I love you 
I don't know 
You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby 
But I love you baby 
Oh darlin, darlin, darlin

You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on 
This cold black earth, baby
No I never, I never knew 
How much love could hurt
Until I loved you baby
Till I loved you baby, baby
Oh baby, I can't stop 
I can't stop crying can't you see
Here I'm pleadin on my knees
I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please
Cause I love you, I love you baby
Sure enough, baby, yeah
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know none of us
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know, I don't know
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know
Nobody can do nothing about it
