
Honey you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much
Baby you make me feel like you need me a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much

When you say those words of love to me
It makes me feel so good inside
But when the sunshine comes and you must leave
It only leaves me with my own foolish pride

Baby you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Baby you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much

Oh, when you say those words of love to me
I know you know you make me feel so good inside
But if by break of day you never can stay
There must be something in our love that I don't know about that you
Feel you've got to hide

Baby, baby, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Baby you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Hey I love you, I love you, I love, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you, I need you, I love, I love you
Feel me, feel me, feel me, feel me, love me, love me
I love you baby, don't let nobody tell you that I don't love you baby
Oh oh I love you
Baby, have you ever wished that forever nighttime could last
Don't leave my heart a broken glass baby, oh oh
Sometimes I feel like I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Maybe three much
Yeah, I love you
You make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much
