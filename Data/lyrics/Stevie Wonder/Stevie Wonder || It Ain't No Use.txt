Um um um um 

There ain't no reason for us sittin' down
To try to talk our problems out
'Cause we know the truth,
It ain't no use each other we must do without. 

There ain't no reason tryin' to force a smile
When pain is really in its place
'Cause we know the truth,
It ain't no use let's part before we lose love's trace. 

(We've got to say)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh
Wow oh oh oh ooh 

As I look back I'm really try'n to see
Just what it was that made us spark
'Cause the fire's out
It leaves no doubt, the flame's not burning in our hearts. 

We still are young and both of us have time
To find our winter love in spring
Yes we know the truth
It ain't no use, we're not each other's ev'rything. 

(We always must say bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh
Wow oh oh oh ooh 

(Hate to say goodbye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh

(Why we say bye)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
The trill is gone babe, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
I tried my best to make it work
(Wow oh oh oh ooh)
But it seems that we can't get it together, yeah,
(Wow oh ooh) 

We've got to run in the world
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Seems that we just don't want tot do it
(Wow oh ooh oh ooh)
I guess we run out of fluid.
(Wow oh ooh) 

Yeah, yeah, yeah wonderful baby, baby, baby
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Don't go, take me baby, don't go baby
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Ain't no use 'cause we done run out of juice
(Wow oh oh oh ooh)
(Wow oh ooh)
So long baby bye bye baby.
