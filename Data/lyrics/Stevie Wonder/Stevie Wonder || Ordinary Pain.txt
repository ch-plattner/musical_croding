
When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart 

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart 

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart 

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart 

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart 

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart 

[PART II]

You're just a masachistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a play boy you said no
or*di*nary pain
This little girl mind you will blow
or*di*nary pain
But then I blew you out the box
or*di*nary pain
When I put my stuff on key and lock
or*di*nary pain
It makes me feel kind of sick
or*di*nary pain
To know love put you in a trick
or*di*nary pain
I knew our love would have to end
or*di*nary pain
The day I made it with your friend
or*di*nary pain
Giving your love to one unreal
or*di*nary pain
Like a big fool I know you feel
or*di*nary pain
But in this lovie-dovie game
or*di*nary pain
With all its joy there must be pain
or*di*nary pain
But now the time has surely come
or*di*nary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
or*di*nary pain
You're cryin big corcodile tears
or*di*nary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
or*di*nary pain
When I was home wainting for you 
or*di*nary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
or*di*nary pain
You know I'd really like to stay
or*di*nary pain
But like you did I've go to play
or*di*nary pain
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
or*di*nary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
or*di*nary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
or*di*nary pain
But to your music I can't dance
or*di*nary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
or*di*nary pain
About you blowin what you had
or*di*nary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
or*di*nary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
or*di*nary pain 

or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
