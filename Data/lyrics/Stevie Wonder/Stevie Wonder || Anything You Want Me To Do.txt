I Love You
But I've been away from you so long
God take me back to where I belong baby
I'll do what you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do,
I'll do anything

I want you
I never needed you so bad
Why do you feel like making me so sad
Girl I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to

Love's the thing thats made us happy,
Love's the thing thats made us sad,
If we don't get back together,
We might lose our romance
Might not get a second chance...

I Love You
And I wanna be your man
If you tell me that I can baby
You know I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

Love's the thing thats made us happy,
Love's the thing thats made us sad,
If we don't get back together,
We might lose our romance
Might not get a second chance...

I Love You
And I wanna be your man
If you tell me that I can baby
I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

I'll do what you want me to

I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

Everything you want me to

I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

Every every every every every every every every every

I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

Everything
Everything you want me to do

I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
[Fade]
