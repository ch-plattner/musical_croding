People hand in hand 
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land ? 
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands 
Or is this a vision in my mind ? 

The law was never passed 
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last 
Have we really gone this far through space and time 
Or is this a vision in my mind ? 

I'm not one who makes believe 
I know that leaves are green 
They only change to brown when autumn comes around 
I know just what I say 
Today's not yesterday 
And all things have an ending 

But what I'd like to know 
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful 
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away 
To the vision in our mind ? 

I'm not one who makes believes 
I know that leaves are green 
They only change to brown when autumn comes around 

I know just what I say 
Today's not yesterday 
And all things have an ending 

But what I'd like to know 
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful 
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away 
To the vision in our minds ?
