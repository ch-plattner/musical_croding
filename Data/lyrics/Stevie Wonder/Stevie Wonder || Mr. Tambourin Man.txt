I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet and the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind it's just a shadow you're seein' that he’s chasing

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you
