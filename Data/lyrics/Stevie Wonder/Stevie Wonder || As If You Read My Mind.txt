Close your eyes ‘til the morning
Close your eyes ‘til the early dew
Get inside what you've been missing
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you 

Take a chance on the secret
That you hide for beneath your dreams
Use your wildest imagination
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

Let's get high on the happy
With a toast to you and me
Love is here just for the giving
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go
