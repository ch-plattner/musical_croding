
You are so unpredictable 
When I am not 
You are so irresistible 
That I can't stop 
You say my name 
And start walking on heaven 

What flying saucer did you come here on 
What extraterrestrial planet are you from 
You're much more than life 
You are from galaxy paradise 
What flying saucer did you come here on 
What will they say when they find that you're gone 
Say you'll stay in my life 
Queen from galaxy paradise 

You are so unforgettable 
When I will not 
Our love's far more than sensual 
And twice as hot 
You touch my hand 
And I know that we'll love forever 

What flying saucer did you come here on 
What extraterrestrial planet are you from 
You're much more than life 
You are from galaxy paradise 
What flying saucer did you come here on 
What will they say when they find that you're gone 
Say you'll stay in my life 
Queen from galaxy paradise
