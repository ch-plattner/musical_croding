
Is the answer in his eyes?
Is the answer in her smile?
Or in the words that you first hear her say
Is it in the nick of time?
First impression in your mind
Do you know it all in just one day?

How will I know she loves me?
How will I know she cares?
It's hard for true love to find you, find you
So easy to feel you're there
How will I know she loves me?
I know all things in time
Well, I have no problem waiting, waiting
For true love forever mine

Is the answer in her glance?
The first time you're holding hands
Or in the moment that feels oh so right
Is it in her tenderness?
Or the magic of his kiss
Or in the sweet love you make through the night

How will I know she loves me?
How will I know she cares?

It hard for true love to find you, find you
So easy to feel you're there
How will I know she loves me?
I know all things in time
Well I have no problem waiting, just waiting
For true love one of a kind
For true love forever mine
