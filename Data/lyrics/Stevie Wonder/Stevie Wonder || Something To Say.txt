
There is something, that I'd like to say to you
There are people, who will try to put us down
They will tell us were too young to see it through girl
Try to make us cry
But don't you worry
You have me and I have you

Well there is something that I think you ought to know
There are people, who will say our love won't grow oh no
It's important that you face them with a smile girl
And you tell them
Hunny maybe someday lovin just might be worth while
Whoa yeah
Well there is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby
They can't hurt us, though I know they'll try
And it will work out
But they won't know why
And there is something to our love that just can't die

It's important that you face them with a smile girl
And you tell them hunny
Maybe someday, lovin just might be worth while
Oh baby
There is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby!

Well there is something just for me and you
