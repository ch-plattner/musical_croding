I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life.

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life.

All my life I was alone,
Didn't think I'd find my part,
Now I see there's joy inside your arms.

Every day I searched for the star,
That never was in the sky,
And now I see this star is on earth.

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be -that's
what you told me yea
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life.

(I am) And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be -that's the way
it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life.

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom I love you.

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom I love you.

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be -baby that's
what you told me yea
If I should ever bring you inside my life.
-bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
-woa that's what you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life.

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom

Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
-baby that's what you told me yea
If I should ever bring you inside my life.
-bring you inside my life yea

I'm happier than the stars above
-yea the morning stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
-that's what you told me yea
If I should ever bring you inside of my life.

I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happy happy, happy
