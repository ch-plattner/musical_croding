Child, don't you know baby
Oww, don't you know baby
Little girl, little girl, don't you know
Please listen to me baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so
Turn your lamp down low
I said turn your lamp down low
Wooo, turn it down
Please turn your lamp down low
Come on baby
Girl I'm in love with you so
Now I know I've been away
For such a long time
But now baby
I can't get you off of my mind
So come on, please baby come on
Come on, come on
Love your daddy all night long
Now if you love me
Like I love you
We can do all the things that we
Used to do
So come on, Oww, baby come on
Please baby come on
Love your daddy all night long
