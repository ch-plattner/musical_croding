Look at how they stop and stare
As if they've never seen a heart in love
And though I see them I don't care
Cuz, I'm too busy thinking bout our love

Thinking about that each and every morning
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
And though it seems I'm hooked on this fixation
I will not stop my daydreaming 
Until my nights are true with you

Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

Listen at me call your name
As if you're witness to my every word
And though it seems sometimes insane
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
So I wait so patiently the moment
When my love fantasies will come to life
And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth, those moments 
That I long with you

Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

On flute, Hubert Laws

And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth, those moments 
That I long with you

Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

[Female backgrounds:]
Ooh fire
Ooh fire Ooh fire
I want to feel your love
Feel your love mixed with mine

[Male background:]
Can't cha feel the fire burning?
Can't cha feel the pulsation of my heart?
Can't cha feel the fire burning?
Yeah yeah, mixed with mine
