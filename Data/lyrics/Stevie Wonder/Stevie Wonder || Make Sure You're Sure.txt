Well the night is young 
And the stars are out 
And your eyes are all aglow 
And you say you feel 
Ways you've never felt 
But are you sure, make sure you're sure 

Well, the wine is sweet 
And the music sways 
And your lips are so divine 
And you say you know 
That you're falling in love 
Now, let's be mature, make sure you're sure 

I'm not accustomed to wearing my feelings 
In a place that's so obvious to see 
But if eyes don't lie 
There's a chance that you are not fooling yourself 
and me 

Well the night is through 
And the sun's come out 
And so too has your lovely smile 
And you vow to stay 
In these arms always 
Can you endure, now are you sure 

Love can be so insecure 
So please be sure
