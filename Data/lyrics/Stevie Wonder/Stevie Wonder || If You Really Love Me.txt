
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around 

You call my name
Oooh so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you 

But if you really love me won't you tell me..
But if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around 

I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby
It's time to go...
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say 

Oh if you really love me won't you tell me..
Oh if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around no
Playing around no
Hey yeah
Goofin' around no
Oh baby
Playing around no
Let me know how you feel baby
Hey oh baby
Playing around no
