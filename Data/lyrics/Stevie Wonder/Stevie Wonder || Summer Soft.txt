Summer soft... 
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off 
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus 
She brings gifts through her breeze 

Morning rain... 
Gently plays her rythms on your window pane 
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change 
To bring rain or sunshine 

And so you wait to see what she'll do 
Is it sun or rain for you 
But it breaks your heart in two 
When you find it's October 

And she's gone 
And she's gone 
Summer's gone 
Taking with her summer's play 

Winter wind... 
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend 
But not waiting for your answer ne begins 
Forcing dangers 'way with his breeze 

Morning snow... 
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw 
But just where or when he never lets you know 
If it's snow or clear days you'll find 

And so you wait to see what he'll do 
Is it sun or snow for you 
But it breaks your heart in two 
Cause you've been fooled by April 

And he's gone 
And he's gone 
Winter's gone 

You find it's October 
And she's gone 
And she's gone 
Summer's gone 

You've been fooled by April 
And she's gone 
And she's gone 
Winter's gone 

You find it's October 
And she's gone 
And she's gone 
Summer's gone 

You've been fooled by April 
And she's gone 
And she's gone 
Winter's gone
