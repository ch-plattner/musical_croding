Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love 
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love 

Lighting up the candles 
To what use to be 
Tender memories in moments of love 
Happy times and bad times 
All seem wonderful 
When you have a toast to moments of love 
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love 

Lighting up the candles 
To what use to be 
Tender memories in moments of love 
Happy times and bad times 
All seem wonderful 
When you have a toast to moments of love 

I really think we could have made it 
To that forever and a day 
But destiny and fate decided 
They would get in our way 

Lighting up the candles 
Wishing you the best 
Like the happiness in moments of love 
For lighting up the candles 
Spark the memories 
Helping us to see more moments of love 

I really think we could have made it 
To that forever and a day 
But destiny and fate decided 
They would get in our way 

For lighting up the candles 
Spark the memories 
Helping us to see the need for what was 
Helping us to see more moments of love 

Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love 
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love 
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love
