
Isolated junk yard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life 

Sweet fragrance irritates
In a state room death awaits
Persecute your own self-pride 

Suffocate the new high
Ride the thorny mule that cries
"Dig your grave and step right in" 

Like a judas pay the price
30 pieces for a ride
Here's the fire take a chew 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Shredded know-how give away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs 

Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly slowly drowns 

Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul go'n pity you 

Hurdly over time to death
With open arms it waits I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground? 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time
