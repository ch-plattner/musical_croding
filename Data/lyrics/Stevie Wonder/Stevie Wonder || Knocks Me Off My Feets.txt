I see us in the park 
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head 
And words from our hearts 
Told only to the wind felt even without being said 
I don't want to bore you with my trouble 
But there's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 

There's supmtin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 
Knocks me off my feet 

I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
More and more 

We lay beneath the stars 
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind 
I reach out for the part 
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find 
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble 
But there's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 

There's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 
Knocks me off my feet 

I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
Darling I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
Darling I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
