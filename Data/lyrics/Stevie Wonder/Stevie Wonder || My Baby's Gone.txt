
Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
I ain't had no loving since my baby been gone

I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I wonder 'bout my baby, what's gonna happen to me

My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
My whole life is in misery

My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
And now I'm worried taht you can see
