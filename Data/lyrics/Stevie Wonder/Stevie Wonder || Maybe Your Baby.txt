
I'm feelin' down and some kind of lonely, 
Cause' my baby done left me here, 
Heart's blazing like a five alarm fire 
And I don't even give a care 

I feel like the world is turnin' on me, 
My dreams turnin' to ashes right in front of my face, 
And I'm gettin' kind of worried, 
And I feel so out of place, 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

[Background] . . I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh 
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 

In the mornin' when I've got heartache, 
I can't call up the doctor for help, 
Cause' the only person that could ever do me any good, 
Is steppin' out with my best friend 

I feel like I'm slippin' deeper, 
Slippin' deeper into myself, 
And I can't take it, 
This stuff is scarin' me to death 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Kinda makin' me worried, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer, 
Checkin' out the guys that are passing by 

[Background]...by, by, by, by... 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Not includin' future plans, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe my baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe my baby done made another plan 
with another man. 
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby, 
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
