They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been wasting most their lives 
Glorifying days long gone behind 
They've been wasting most their days 
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise 
Tell me who of them will come to be 
How many of them are you and me

They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been looking in their minds 
For the day that sorrow's gone from time 
They keep telling of the day 
When the Savior of love will come to stay 
Tell me who of them will come to be 
How many of them are you and me

They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
We've been spending too much of our lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 

Let's start living our lives 
Living for the future paradise 
Praise to our lives 
Living for the future paradise 
Shame to anyones lives 
Living in a pastime paradise
