Lady love and lady cared
but lady went away,
And left me all alone to suffer.

And now I feel it's not fair
for me to fall in love
The truth is the real me you must uncover.

Seems so long, since I've heard the sound
It's been so long, since I've trusted in someone else,
Had to see it all for myself,
It's been so long, that the world seems cold,
But I think it's time in my life to find myself again.

Lady loved and lady stayed,
Until she was too pleased
She knew I wouldn't leave for her to suffer.
I'd never make her suffer.

Now I believe you're just like me,
In that you understand,
And want me for your man to always love me.

You can believe it's seems so long, since I've touched a wanting hand
Oh, it seems so long, since I've trusted in someone else,
Had to see this world for myself,
And it's been so long that the world seems cold,
Now I think I've found someone to make me trust in someone again.

I believe that I can trust in you.
