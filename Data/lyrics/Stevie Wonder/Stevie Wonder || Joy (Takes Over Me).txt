You can bet you're sweeter than ever
And your love is making it better
I can feel it in my bones
Oooh each time we're alone

Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
Cause joy, joy takes over me

Through thick and thin I'll stand
Loving you always
Yes I need you mama
To take the heartache away
I know the sun's gon' shine
And as long as you're mine
It's joy, joy, joy I feel inside

Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud
Ooh baby baby baby babe
Like a spinning top
I can't stop
Just loving you
You know Stevie loves you
Needs you baby oh yeah

You know my love is sure to live
Ain't goin' nowhere
And I do believe girl
You were meant for me

Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
Cause joy, joy takes over me

Oh baby joy
Joy, joy, joy, joy
Joy joy joy joy joy joy
The way you love me joy
Takes over me
Oh the way you love me
The way you need me
Baby please don't leave me
I get joy.
