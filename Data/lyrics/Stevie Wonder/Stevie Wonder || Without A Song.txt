
Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born, but he's no good no how
Without a song

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along, as long as a song
Is strung in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know, what makes the grass grow tall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song
