
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one

There is a missing person that I've just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I can't say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one
I looked inside an album of happy photographs
To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I travelled through the moments that held a special place
But everytime what came to mind is that smile upon your face

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what can I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one
