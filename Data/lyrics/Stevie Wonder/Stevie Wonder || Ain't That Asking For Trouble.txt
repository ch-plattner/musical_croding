Ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby you remind me of a pretty rose
That's awfully painful to my touch
And though there's thorns underneath the rose
Baby you hurt twice as much

You made me cry a thousand times, ha
And leaving me with a broken heart
I should stand many miles away
But I'm right here in your arms

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby the way I'm at your beck and call
I must be hypnotised
'Cause I, I know I've got sense enough to know
That loving you ain't wise

Sure as the sun may shine
My heart will be in pain
Like a child that's seen papa
I'm in your arms again

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby I, I can't stop my loving you
Until you hurt me so much
My plans not to see you again
Baby but your tender touch
I guess I'm just too weak for you
I shoulda been so long gone
But here I'm in your arms again
And I'm still holding on

Now ain't that asking for trouble
