
You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Other are searching for
They never find
We've had it all the time

So in love
That's how we live
Never take
Darling we always give
Happiness is every day
But it never would be
If it wasn't for you loving me

I was lost
Like a rolling stone I had to roam
As if I knew
That in time I'd find my way to
Here I am
In a paradise just built for two
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for you

You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find
We've had it all the time

One more thing
I wanna say
I've sacrificed day and night
To keep you happy
One more thing
I forgot to say
I bless the day I found ya
Cause I've built my world around ya

You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find
We've had it all the time

Hey so in love
That's how we live
Never take, never take
Always give
Happiness is every single day
But it never would be baby
If it wasn't for you loving me
