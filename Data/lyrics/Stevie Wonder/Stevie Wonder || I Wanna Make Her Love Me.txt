I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
And I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
And I wanna make her love me till the fire don't burn
And I wanna make her love me till the world cease to turn

Oh papa, I'm like a little lost lamb
Reaching for a girl that's out of reach
Ah, sit right down and talk to me man to man
Tell me how to practice what you used to preach
Oh, papa used to tell me that a man could do
Anything he ever put his heart into

But I wanna make her love me till them seas run dry
And I wanna make her love me till money can't buy
I wanna make her love me till the fifth week in May
And I wanna make her love me till Ol' Man River runs away

Oh, she's a ditty and as pretty as Mona Lisa
Papa's rich and her mama's proud
I worked three jobs tryin' to get what might please her
But still she lives in a world where I ain't allowed
Ah papa, you used to tell me it might take a little sweat
But when a man wakes up he sure enough will get

I wanna make her love me till the kingdom come
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till right is wrong

Ah Hey, yeah Hey

Ah, I can't compete with Baby Face Pete
And I ain't no match for Lou
He gave her a diamond, a diamond ring the other week
And all I can give her is a heart so true
Oh, papa used to say a true heart will reign
What a true heart desires it sure enough will gain

But I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till it snows in June
Hey, hey, save on my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
