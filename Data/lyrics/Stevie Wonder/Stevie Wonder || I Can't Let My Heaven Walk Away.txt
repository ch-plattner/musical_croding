
I can't let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone

Called her name but I called in vain
I know she can't answer from a picture frame
Only an hour ago I held her in real flesh and blood
She just grabbed her coat and said please I've had enough

She kept me well like a Sunday prayer
Just like my own right hand the girl was always there
To every man but me her eyes were blind
I was in the promise land long before my time

I can't let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone

I accused my baby of being a liar
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial
I only asked her to hear her tell me no
But my question back-fired, I didn't expect her to go

I cant let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone
[Repeat]
