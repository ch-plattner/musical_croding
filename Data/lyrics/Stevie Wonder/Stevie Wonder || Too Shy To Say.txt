
You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around 

And I can't go on this way...
With it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you... 

I wanna fly 
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do 
I wanna be 
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end 

And I can't go on this way...
With it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you... 

And I can't go on this way...
Feelin' it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ohh.. ooh...
I... do...
