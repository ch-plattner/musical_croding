Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

I'm the luckiest guy in the world
'Cause I've got one pearl of a girl
For my baby I work part-time
Down at the neighborhood five-and-dime
Half of my money goes to buy her
Some of the things her little heart desires
The other half goes dime by dime
To show my cookie a real good time, because

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

She's sweet and she's kind
And she tells me that she's mine all mine, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

I walk around with my chest stuck out
'Cause my baby's worth bragging about
Every Johnnie, Jack, and Jim
Wished that she belonged to him
I gave up the old gang of mine
'Cause with my girl goes all my time
One of these days I'm gonna buy her a ring
And marry her - and everything, because

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

She's sweet and she's mellow
And she tells me that I'm one heck of a fellow, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl

She's all right and out of sight
And I love her ah-ha-ha, yeah ah-ah-ha-ha-ha ha
Ah-ha-ha yeah, I'm gonna get her a diamond ring, everything
