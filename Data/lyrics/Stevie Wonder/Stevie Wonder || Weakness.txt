Everytime I think our love is drifting apart
Something always throws it back together
And everytime I think I've found someone new for my heart
After one kiss my heart tells me never

Oh everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

Everytime I think your love has no more to give
You do something more to take me higher
And everytime I think that for someone else I could live
I'd be living love out as a liar

Oh everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

We keep thinking that our love won't last beyond tomorrow
But our hearts say we're gonna stay in love this way

Oh everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

[Repeat chorus]
