
This is fun day 
Yours and my day 
This is fun day, dee ooh, wee ooh 

This is fun day 
On a fine day 
When the air is filled with tweeting birds that sing 
together in the sun 
This is your day 
Yours and my day 
When you feel the joy of children playing, 
laughing from dust till dawn 
On a day like this you share your joy 
with everyone 
Share your peace, and share your joy, 
and share your love 

This is fun day 
On a fine day 
When you feel the urge of getting up to start-up 
with the break of dawn 
This is your day 
Yours and my day 
When you turn on your radio and hear the DJ 
playing your favorite song 
On a day like this not even bad can rub 
you wrong 
Cause you say it's okay cause it's your day 

I'm gonna go out to the park 
Where you feel the joy in every heart 
That's what I need to start each day off right 
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me 
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree 
Fun day should be each day in all our lives 

This is fun day 
Yours and my day 
This is fun day, dee ooh, wee ooh

This is love day 
A celebration 
A day on every calendar that's set aside 
for everyone to give 
This is your day 
Such a fun day 
I cannot believe a day like this has come 
that's if this really is 
I'm so very proud to say that for this day I've lived 
To see your peace, to see your joy, and to 
see your love 

I'm gonna go out to the park 
Where you feel the joy in every heart 
That's what I need to start this day off right 

Oh, I'll find a place for you and me 
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree 
Fun day should be each day in all our lives 

This is love day 
A celebration 
A day on every calendar that's set aside for 
everyone to give 

Let me solo, let me solo, let me solo...solo
