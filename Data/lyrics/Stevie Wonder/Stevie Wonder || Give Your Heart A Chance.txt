
Spring will come to those who seek it
Love belongs to those who speak it
And in awhile you're sure to smile
If you give your heart a chance

Joy is not beyond achieving
If you're not beyond believing
True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance
