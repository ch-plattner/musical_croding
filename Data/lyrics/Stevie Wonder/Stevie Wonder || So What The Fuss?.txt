If I'm caught at a dance party without my dancin shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet 
Shame on me 
If I'm mindin my business just doin the right thing 
And you try to front me off in the street 
Shame on you 
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
come their way 
But they ain't tryin to get on their knees and pray 
Shame on them 
And if we live in a time where every nation's fightin
'round the world 
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way 

Shame on us 
Shame on me, Shame on you, Shame on them, Shame on us
[repeat]
So what the fuss 

If I gotta get up early in the morning for a job
interview 
And I forget to set the stupid alarm 
Shame on me 
If my children are playin outside like little children do 
And you come 'round there tryin to bring them some harm 
Shame on you 
Should I be drivin thru a klantown, find a restaurant
to get me some food 
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind" 
Shame on them 
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
power to vote 
Knowin some would like to turn back the hands of time 

Shame on us 
Shame on me, Shame on you, Shame on them, Shame on us
[repeat]
So what the fuss 

If I'm hooked on a habit knowin damn well it could
cost me my life 
Yet I keep doin what I should do without 
Shame on me 
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
just gives you abuse 
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out 
Shame on you 
If we're jammin the music and somebody's got the
audacity 
To say that they can jam it better than us 
Shame on them 
And should there be just a handful that believe that
we are totally free 
And there's no need to fight for equality 

Shame on us 
Shame on me, Shame on you, Shame on them, Shame on us
[repeat]
So what the fuss
