
Into each life there comes a time
When you must pay your lovers' dues
Breakin' out in a cold sweat
Cause you've been rightfully accused

I'm not such a strong man
That love can't make me weak
You're walkin' out the door
And it's hurting me so deep, so deep

And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
saying goodbye to me

Every young boy will grow up
To then become a man
Then the difference from wrong and right
He clearly understands
I'm not such a big man
That I can't break down in tears
Cause my whole body went into shock
When you told me you were out of here! Out of here!

And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're saying
goodbye to me, to me

I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, so sorry

If you added up all the good times
And compared them with the bad
You'd realize that our love
Was the best you ever had

I'm not such a proud man
That I won't cop a plea
See me baby girl, I'm on my knees
Beggin please, baby please, baby please, oh yeah

I'm sorry, sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, I'm sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
saying goodbye to me, me baby, me baby, me baby

I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry [repeat]
