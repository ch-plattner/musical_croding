
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...baby

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...all right

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love

Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!

Oh, I don't care how long it might take
'Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance

Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you, oh yeah

Turn your feelings in your heart back to me right away
And I'll get it

But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you donâ€™t like the groove you can turn the record off
