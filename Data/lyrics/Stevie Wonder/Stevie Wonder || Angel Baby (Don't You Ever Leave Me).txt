Ha ha yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Oh my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

My little precious angel
Don't you know I'm glad I found ya
I'm gonna dedicate my life to you
And build my world around you

I'm gonna love you through the years
I'll never bring you pain nor tears
I wanna keep you satisfied
So you'll never, never, never leave my side

Oh my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

'Cause I love ya and I need ya
And I'll treat you oh so kind
If you ever leave me baby
I'd go right out of my mind

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Girl you're my sunshine
You make me smile when skies are grey
But I'll never, never smile again
If somebody take my sunshine away
So I'm gonna work and toil, sweat and strain
Try to give you everything

So no rich man, poor man begger man thief
Could ever steal you away from me

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

'Cause I love ya and I need ya
And I want you for myself
I couldn't make it baby
If you leave me for somebody else

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you never ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me
