
Ow...
Tossing and turning all night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart
Her memory, can't shake it
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart, won't make it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)

(I, want my baby back)
She's the only girl that brightens up my world
What can I say, don't make her do it
She's fine as can be and was so good to me
I had a good thing, and I blew it
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone
What can I do, to renew it
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hesitate, to get to it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my sugar back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah
(I, want my baby back)

Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah I, want my baby back
My heart is aching, think it's breaking
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back
My world is lonely, need her only
Everybody sing I want my baby back now
(I want my baby back)
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back
My heart is sadly...
