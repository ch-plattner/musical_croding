
She was five and I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang I shot you down
Bang bang you hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang I used to shoot you down

The music played and people sang
And just for me the church bells rang

Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Yeah!
Bang bang bang bang

Now she's gone I don't know why
'Till this day some times I cry
She didn't even say goodbye
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down
