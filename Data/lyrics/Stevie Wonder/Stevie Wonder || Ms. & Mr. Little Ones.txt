
What is that that you're looking through 
a pornographic magazine?
When I bet you don't even know how to
spell the word
And you say you don't leave home unless
you're strapped
With your uzi sub machine
When you've just barely come into this world
Well, if a child's ways and actions
Reflect what they hear and see
Guess the only ones to blame are you and me

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world 
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

What kind of name is that you're calling her
I've heard that word before
But I don't think any parent would give their
daughter a name so low
And about this extra paraphernalia
You say you're carrying to get high

That won't take you anywhere you want to go
Well, you don't have to listen
Cause it's here for you to see
So many burnt out lives trapped in their misery

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

Oh, I could rattle on about the good old days
And how life used to be
And even inwardly relive them vividly
But the best advice I can give to you
Is that we only go around one time
Treat each day like this is it
And give it the best you can

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
There's so much we should and should
have never done
That's why we're beggin' on our knees
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
