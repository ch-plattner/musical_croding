
We are idle strangers
Married to our dangers
Into space we go to change our ways

Flying to our heavens
We are all together
Into hell we chase the light of day

Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll see
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind

We are charmed by living
Dazzled into giving
All the waste we plan to ignore

Coldness is the virtue
Measured by the untrue
Love is used for something but what for?

Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll see
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind
Look around
