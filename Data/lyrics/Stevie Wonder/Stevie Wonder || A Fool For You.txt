
I know you told me
Such a long time ago
Oh that you didn't want me girl
You didn't love me no more

I want to know
Oh, what makes me love you the way i do
Like a fool for you
I say, I'm a fool for you

I know you told me
You didn't want me `round
But I know girl
You got a man way `cross town

So I know it's something
Oh, what makes me love you the way i do
Must be that I'm a fool for you
Such a fool for you

Did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Nothing on your mind
But love love sweet love
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Even cry so loud, yeah
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for you

So I know it's something
Oh, oh, Lord
I'm a fool for you
