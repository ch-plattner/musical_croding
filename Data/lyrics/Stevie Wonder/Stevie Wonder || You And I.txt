
Here we are on earth together, 
It's you and I, 
God has made us fall in love, it's true, 
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say, 
That you will be by my side 
To see me through, 
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world, 
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 

I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through, 
But I found strength in you, 
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day, 
Because that's all that I am living for, you see, 
Don't worry what happens to me 

Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always, 
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I 
In my mind we can conquer the world 
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I
