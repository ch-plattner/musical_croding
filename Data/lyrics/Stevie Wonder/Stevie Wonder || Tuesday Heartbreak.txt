
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair, 
Cause you say that you found another man, 
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care, 
Cause you found you another man 

I want to be with you when you're all alone, 
I want to be with you 
when you feel you got another man, 
You see, baby, it's all alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes, 
I wanna stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you 

Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag, 
When you know that you love her especially, 
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams, 
Maybe than I can see you all the time 

But I wanna be with you when the nightime comes 
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes, 
I wanna stay and never go away, 
Oh baby, it's alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna stay with you till the morning runs, 
I wanna, baby, baby, baby, it's alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna be with you till the daytime comes 
Oh baby, get away, alright
