
People goin' round 
Tellin' others they are square 
Around and round in circles 
Is a ride that goes somewhere 
All you need to fly 
Is a heart dying to try 
A chemical love 
It's a chemical love 

Ain't nothin to it 
Gettin' cash when you are broke 
Doin' lots of time 
Is worth a little snort of coke 
Infected needles 
Can aid you in no time 
Through chemical love 
You've got a chemical love 

Some people crave for physical love 
Some people crave material love 
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love 
You've got a chemical jones 
You've got a chemical love 

Yeah, a chemical love 
You've got chemical love 

Some people find themselves hooked on the 
weirdest things 
That have nothing to do with living 
God's gift to us is our life what's ours to him 
If it's not our love, then nothing's given, given 

Some people crave for physical love 
Some people crave material love 
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love 
You've got a chemical jones 
For a chemical love 

Yes it's true 
The best things in life are free 
Not material 
Chemical or physically 
Try it for yourself 
You'll get a guaranteed high 
From spiritual love, natural miracle drug 

Some people crave for physical love 
Some people crave material love 
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love 
You've got a chemical jones 
You've got a chemical love 

You've got a chemical love 
For a chemical drug 

Some people crave for physical love 
Some people crave material love 
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love 
You need a spiritual jones 
For that spiritual love 

I'm talking to you 
We all could do with spiritual jones 
For some spiritual love
