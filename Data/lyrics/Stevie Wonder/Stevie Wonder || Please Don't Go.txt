Please don't go, no no no;
If you go I'll be sad and blue,
So I say no no no, don't go away. 

Oh no please don't leave, baby please;
If you should leave my poor heart would grieve
So I say nay nay nay, baby please stay. 

And I'll do ev'rything you want me to
If you promise that you won't leave tonight
'Cause I'll break down and cry a river of tears
With just the thought of you not here in my life.
