Pan is my name
I live outside the door
I have to keep the score of things around you

Fire and air,
water I prepare
I am the piper at the gates of dawning

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

Fancy I fell,
A childlike tap I'll steal
Look twice my friend it's not the wind at all

You'll never see,
What you refuse to be
The power in the seeing is believing.

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do
