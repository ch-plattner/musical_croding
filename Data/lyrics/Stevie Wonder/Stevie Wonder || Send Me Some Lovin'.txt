
Send me some loving
Send it I pray
How can I love you
When you?re far away?

Oh, send me your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are near
Can't you send me your kisses?

I can feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you

Can?t you send me your kisses?
I can feel their touch
I miss you so badly
I need you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you
