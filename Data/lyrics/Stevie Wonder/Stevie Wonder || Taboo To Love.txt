
Are you telling me you feel
Like you have never felt
Ut Oh, my heart
Don't you know those famous words
Be seen but not heard
Taboo to love

Are you telling me your eyes
Met hers to your surprise
But why, my heart?
How loud must you hear me say
Have fun but don't play
Taboo to love

Where's your lantern or candlelight
So to guide you through the hidden spaces
Through its said truth unveils all lies
Feelings can't be left to roam

So you say you've lost your head
But you use your heart instead
Beware of love
This is not like you at all
Who vowed to never fall
Taboo to love, taboo to love
Taboo [Background]
To love, taboo to love
Taboo [Background]

Where's your raincoat and over-boots
To protect you in stormy weather
Though its said when you walk in truth
Love can bring you no harm

So you've made up in your mind
You'll leave your fears behind
So brave my heart
I guess your heart has made you see
It's better to be free
No taboo to love

I guess your heart has made you see
It's much better to be free
No taboo to love
No taboo to love
Taboo [Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo [Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo [Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo [Background]
No taboo to love
