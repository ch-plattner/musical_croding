
The wretchedness of Satan's wrath
Will come to seize you at last
'cause even he frowns upon the deeds you are doing
And you know deep in your heart
You've no covenant with God
'cause he would never countenance people abusing

You know apartheid's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like slavery was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like the holocaust was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Apartheid is wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong
It's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)

The pain you cause in God's name
Points only to yourself to blame
For the negative karma you will be receiving
'cause when people are oppressed
With atrocities that test
The future of all mankind we, the world won't stand seeing

You know apartheid's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like slavery was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like the holocaust was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Apartheid is wrong (Qha), it's wrong (Qha), wrong
It's wrong (Qha), it's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
