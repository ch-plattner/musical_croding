
Did you say,
I've got a lot to learn.
Well don't think,
I'm trying not to learn.
Since this is the perfect spot to learn.
Teach me tonight.

Starting with,
The abc of it.
Right down to,
The xyz of it.
Help me solve the mystery of it.
Teach me tonight.

The sky's a blackboard,
High above you.
If a shooting star goes by.
I'll use that star.
To write I love you, a thousand times across the sky.

One thing isn't very clear,
My love.
Should the teacher stand so near, my love.
Graduation's almost here,
My love.
Teach me tonight.

I'll use that star.
To write I love you,
A thousand times across the sky.

One thing isn't very clear,
My love.
Should the teacher stand so near,
My love.
Graduation's almost here,
My love.

So would you,
Teach me tonight.
I've lost all fear,
My love.
