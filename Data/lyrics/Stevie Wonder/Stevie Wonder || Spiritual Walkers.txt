
They knock on your door
You laugh in their face
They tell you it's time to pray
They give you a book
And tell you to read
And point to the Judgment Day

People say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life

They sit on a stump
You run from their sight
To not hear the holy word
They sing and they chant
They preach and they speak
In tongues you have never heard

But people say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life

Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Walk on ...

On corners of streets
And airports of tents
They reach out for you to come in
They have no defense
Except inner sense
And knowing the Almighty Friend

People say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never ending light
They will walk their lives
'til they shine the light
Of truth into your life : truth into your life

Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
[Repeat]

Come on and shine that light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers
They just walk the light through the day through the night
Even though when they knock on your door
You laugh in their face
You run from their sight
Not to hear the holy word
They have no defense
Except inner sense
Haven't you
