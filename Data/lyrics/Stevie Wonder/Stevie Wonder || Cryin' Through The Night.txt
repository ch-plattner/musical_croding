
Yes I am cryin' 
I got the blues and I don't know why 
Yes I am cryin' 
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied 
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night 
Tears on my pillow 
And I have been cryin through the night 
Weeping like a weeping willow 
From cryin' through the night 
Hear me cryin' through the night 

I am lonely, downhearted and sad 
'Cause I've lost the best woman that I ever had 
To a friend of mine 

Just can't figure out how it could be 
That somebody like him could take her away from me 
And it's on my mind 
Nearly all the time 

Yes I am cryin' 
I got the blues and I don't know why 
Yes I am cryin' 
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied 
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night 
Tears on my pillow 
And I have been cryin through the night 
Weeping like a weeping willow 
From cryin' through the night 
Hear me cryin' through the night 
Now I know just how best friends can be 
'Cause he made sure you knew your best was with me 
And it's on my mind 

Here's a lesson much greater that wealth 
Keep your business to you, yourself and no one else 
And your smiling eyes 
Won't be cryin' like mine 
Yes I'm cryin' 
I got the blues and I don't know why 
Yes I'm cryin' 
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied 
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night 
Tears on my pillow 
And I have been cryin' through the night 
Weeping like a weeping willow 
From cryin' through the night 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
I'm like a weeping willow 
From cryin' through the night 
Oh, Oh, yeah 
Hear me cryin', cryin', I'm cryin', cryin' 
I'm cryin' baby, cryin' baby yeah 
Even a fool can tell 
That so many tears sho' enough done fell 
And pretty soon before you know 
I'll have enough tears to fill a water well 
Hear me cryin' through the night 
Oh yeah, cryin' through the night 
[Break]
And it's on my mind 
Nearly all the time 

Yes I'm cryin' 
I got the blues and I don't know why 
Yes I'm cryin' 
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied 
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night 
Tears on my pillow 
And I have been cryin' through the night 
Weeping like a weeping willow 
From cryin' through the night 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
I'm weeping like a weeping willow 
Oh, Oh, cryin' tears, cryin' tears 
Through the night
