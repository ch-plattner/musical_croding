Though they say you're not my friend
You've been here through thick and thin
And for that little girl I love ya
And all I want to do is talk about ya.

I'm here to say
I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so.

Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You've made such a happy man out of me.

And I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yea
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so.

Baby, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing
about you baby
Oh yea, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing
about you baby, Mmm yea

Though they say that I am wrong
Cause my love is strong
There's only one that I place above you.
It's God that I place above you.

Girl I just want to say
Love you more each day, yea
I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, yea.

Some folks say that it's strange
But my whole life you have changed
You've saved all the pain the world's put on me
All I want to do is talk about you And I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yea yea
Telling everybody that,
I love you so, yea yea

I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby, yea yea yea
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby.
Oh yea, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby.
You know I love, I love ever' lit' thing, about you babe,
I love it
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby.
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby.
-Every damn thing about you baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby. Oo

Ooh, Mmm, Sugar, All right, Cookie, Puddin', Oh yea
Mmm, Candy, All right,
An' big ol' piece of cake

(Your Baby loves you
He loves every little thing about you.)
