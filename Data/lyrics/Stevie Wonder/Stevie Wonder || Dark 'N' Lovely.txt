There is a place 
On earth's motherland 
Where a people 
Die in bantu stands 
Manchild at eight 
Will face guns of hate 
Womanchild's fate 
Is life second rate 

Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 

They do a dance 
called Mbaqana jive 
Rainbow people 
Dancin' to stay alive 
After hours 
Party hand in hand 
After Shebeen 
Terror strikes again 

Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 

Dark 'n' lovely Dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely 

The whole planet's watchin' 
And the Sun God is watchin', too 
Hey there Botha 
Yes, we are watchin' you 
Spirits can do 
Jah will stop this reign 
Watch our world turn 
To help those in pain 

Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely Dark 'n' lovely 

[Repeat to fade]
