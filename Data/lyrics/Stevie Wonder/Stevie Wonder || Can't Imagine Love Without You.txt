
Can you picture mother earth in the palm of your hand?
The entire universe as a tiny grain of sand
And it feels impossible to do
As I can't imagine love without you

Think of drinking every sea with its salty waters dry
Sprinting 'round the world three times faster than a rocket flies
And the thought of it you can't pursue
As I can't imagine love without you

Some thoughts are just no brainers
Not worth an ounce of time
Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind

Travel back though life inside one Atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue
As I can't imagine love without you

Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind
Travel back though life inside one Atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue
And the thought of it you can't pursue
'Cause it feels impossible to do
As I can't imagine love without you
I can't imagine love without you
