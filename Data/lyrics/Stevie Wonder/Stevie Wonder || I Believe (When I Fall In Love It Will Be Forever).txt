
Shattered dreams, worthless years, 
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell, 
Life began, then was done, 
Now I stare into a cold and empty well 

The many sounds that meet our ears 
the sights our eyes behold, 
Will open up our merging hearts, 
And feed our empty souls 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

Without despair we will share, 
And the joys of caring will not be replaced, 
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm, 
They won't be hard to find, 
And the words of love I speak to you 
will echo in your mind 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 

I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again, 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 

God surely answered my prayer, 
God surely answered by prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
God always will answer your prayers, 
Believe in one who will answer my prayer, 
Thank you God 

Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the woman I've been waiting for, 
Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the girl that I really adore, 
Come on, let's fall in love...[etc]
