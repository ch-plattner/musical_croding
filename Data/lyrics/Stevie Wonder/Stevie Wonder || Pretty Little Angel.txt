A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel

Wish you knew just how I felt about you
Wish you felt the same way as I do
I can bring you love if you just open up your heart
Little girl I'm so in love with you

If you ever tell me that you love me
If you ever show me that you care
I will be so proud to have you
Standing by my side
Little girl I'm so in love with you

We'll be so happy together
We'll build a heaven of our own
And darling, if you just play your part
And let me steal your heart
I know I'll have your love for ever

Angel for your love I have been praying
Hoping someday you will look my way
I can make you mine if you just open up your eyes
Little girl I'm so in love with you

A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
Oh my
A pretty little angel
My, my my
A pretty little angel
