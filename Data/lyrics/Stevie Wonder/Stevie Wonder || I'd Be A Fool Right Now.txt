
They say your love will surely fade girl
When things go wrong and trouble calls
But they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Will never fade when darkness falls
They say that when the chips are down girl
Your love won't stay so long my friend
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Has been around through thick and thin

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside looking inside

They say your love is surely goin'
Just like a snowman in the sun
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Was here when all my friends were gone

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside lookin' inside

All my dreams would fall and crumble into dirt
If I walk away from you I'd be the one to hurt
One day my dreams were surely dying, dying, dying baby
Just like a flower without rain
They just don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Made my life blossom again
And so the story goes around baby yeah y-yeah
That this is just a passing thing
But I believe in your sweet lovin', lovin'... babe
With every summer fallin' rain

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
Oh, hey!

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now...
