I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams 

On the beach we're sittin'
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams 

When I'm sleep at night babaa
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night babaa...
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 

Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah...
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams 

When I'm sleep at night babaa
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night babaa...
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 

Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah...
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
