
Honey, sweet
I've got something to say to you in privacy
Something I'd like for you to hear
And only your ears alone

Secretly, I've been admiring you intensely
So much so I'd like to settle down with you
And make a home

You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea

Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep

From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart

Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart

There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

Honey, sweet
I soared into a heaven's galaxy
So hypnotized was I
From seeing all the magic in your eyes

So I bring
To you what's been a lifetime fantasy
Of being with the only one who can
Create my paradise

You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea

Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep

From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart

Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart

There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart
