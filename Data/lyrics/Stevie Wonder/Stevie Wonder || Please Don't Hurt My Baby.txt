
Such a happy couple love and some
Til man goes busy just for fun
Man gets the guilt, tells fun girl we can't no more
Fun girl says if you stop I'll tell her right now

Aah, please don't hurt my baby
That's all his lips could say
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She won't believe you anyway

I was blinded by sexsation
Temporarily out my head
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She mustn't know we went to bed
You could hear him moaning
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah

What a pretty love pair, perfect fit
Til woman sights on one that she's just got to get with
Woman gets scared tells plaything we can't no more
Plaything says if you stop I'll tell him right now.

Aah, please don't hurt my baby
That's all her lips could say
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
He won't believe you anyway

I was blinded by desire
Temporarily insane
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
He can't know we did the wild thing

And you could hear her crying

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you were giving up that pearl
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah

You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah

You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you were giving up that pearl
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah

You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
