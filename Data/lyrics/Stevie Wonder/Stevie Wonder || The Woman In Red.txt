
Am I seeing what I think I see
Or are my eyes playing tricks on me
'Cause what I see don't make no sense
Looking so good standing over that vent
Earth Venus in broad daylight
The Goddess of Love is in my sight
Gotta catch a hold of myself
'Cause if I don't I'll have nothing left

Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

The woman in red
The woman in red
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head

The woman in red ([Background]-The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

M-M-Miss please pardon me
Now listen to me I can hardly speak
I haven't been this much confused
Since Daddy caught me trying on his shoes
Now, I'm too old to be acting like this
But there's something about her I just can't resist
My heart is beating like a big bass drum
And my mind is saying that girl's the one

Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

The woman in red ([Background]-The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head

The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead
