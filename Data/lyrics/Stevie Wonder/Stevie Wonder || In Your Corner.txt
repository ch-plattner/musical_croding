
I hear tell there's big fun tonight 
On the corner of Main and Dog-Meat-Bite 
Friday midnights would not be right 
Without Redd's hot party and a nasty fight 

But I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 
I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 

You can't renege cause it's going to be alive 
Fine women, lots of liquor and stuff for your mind 
Now where we're going they don't like your kind 
But they'll cool out when you tell them you're a friend of mine 

'Cause I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 
I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 

You can't tell your pa and mama 
Where we're going going till after we've been there 
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry 
And worrying can cause grey hair 
And one thing might lead to another 
And if there'e any trouble they'll blame it on me 

I think we just might have two to go 
The pretty looking over here from the middle of the floor 
We'll make a b-line to Hotel La Sin 
Where you'll do the talking to get us in 

And I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 

We shoulda been long gone 'cause this place is hot 
'Cause in the corner there are two brothers that are undercover cops 
If they stop us for questionning mum is the word 
'Cause a question not answered is an answer not heard 

And I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 
I'll be in your corner 
I'll be in your corner, if they do 

You can't tell your pa and mama 
Where we're going going till after we've been there 
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry 
And worrying can cause grey hair 
And one thing might lead to another 
And if there's any trouble they'll blame it on me
