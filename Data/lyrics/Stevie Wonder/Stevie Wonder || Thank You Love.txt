Thank you love
You made me happy in so many ways
Through all my sweet and ender yesterdays
You were the sunshine I needed love

You were there
You warmed my heart when troubled skies would come
You were my one and only faithful one
I wanna really really thank you love

Thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love

I was lost
Somewhere along life's road I was lost
And on that lonesome road our bridges crossed
You showed me the way to tender love

It's a miracle
Just like the sunshine makes the flower grow
That's just the way you change my whole life show
Through the sunshine of your tender love

Thank you love
With every breath I take I thank you love
With every new day break I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love

Oh my darling, When I'm down
You'll gently squeeze these hands of mine
And I feel just like a child at Christmas time
'cause I could feel the nearness of your love

Oh my darling I've been blessed
A precious thing is this that I possess
Could fill this heart on mine with happiness
I wanna really really thank you love

Oh my baby thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true true love
Thank you, thank you, thank you
