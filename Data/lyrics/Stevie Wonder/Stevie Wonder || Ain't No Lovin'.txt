
Never needed a wishing well to make my happy with my baby.
Never needed a magic spell to start me thinking someday maybe.
I'll build a house of gingerbread someday,
And bring my sugar cookie home to stay 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my baby's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Oh, my Angel Love can't stop dreaming of
How it's gonna be,
It's gonna be for Angel Love and me
Goin' down to the wishing well
Cause that's where I'm gonna meet my baby

Mr Moon mixed a magic spell
He's telling me that I better hurry
To find the girl beneath the willow tree
And run and take my baby home with me 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my sugar's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (hey) Hoo, hooo
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)

Never, never, never, never, never ha, ha
[repeat and fade]
