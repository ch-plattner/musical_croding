
Feeble is the mind that says they don't care
Selfish is the heart that won't give their share
Poor them, Poor we
Wasted is the mind that won't take a stand
Lieth the tongue that says they can't when they can
Poor him, Poor she
For as long as we live,
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe
We all should live to keep our love alive
More than blinds the soul that sees but won't show
Lost the leader with the way but won't go
For you, For me
Worthless is the one with will but won't try
Grounded are we all if we don't think high
Of you, You of me
For as long as we live,
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe
We all should live to keep our love alive
Let's keep our love alive
For as long as I live,
And am blessed with air on earth to breathe
I know I'll live to keep our love alive.
