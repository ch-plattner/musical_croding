Wolf tickets are all you say I'm selling
Well that goes to show what you need to know
Cause I ain't yackin' nothin' I ain't packin'
My love can get with your love toe to toe

So when you're ready
Really, truly ready
Holding strong and steady
I'll be good to go
Cause if you start it
I am gonna finish it
I am gonna knock it
Like it ain't been knocked before

Getting with this
Know you're gonna be
Stepping off the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

Dead air time is all you say you're hearing
Well that shows how much you don't comprehend
Cause it's not in the loud but in the quiet
Where lies the thing that will make your head spin

So when you're willin'
Really, truly willin'
Not just simply illin'
You just let me know
Cause when you get it
I ain't gonna quit it
Girl, I'm gonna hit it
Like it ain't been hit before

Gettin' with this
Know you're gonna be
Stepping off to the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

Pie in the sky is all you say I can deliver
Well wait til you feel what I've got in store
One hundred and eighty pounds of good and plenty
And when you've got the need I've got some more

So when you mean it
Really, truly mean it
Not just scheming to get to it
We can get it on
Cause if you woo it
I'm going to get to it
Girl, we're gonna do it
Until every ounce is gone

Gettin' with this
Know you're gonna be
Stepping off to the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

Are you ready to step off the edge into eternity
Really, really ready to step off the edge into eternity
Cause if you're ready to step off the edge into eternity
We can step right off the edge into eternity
[Repeat]
