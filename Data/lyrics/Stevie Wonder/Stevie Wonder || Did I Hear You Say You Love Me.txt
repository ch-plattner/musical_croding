Aaah...
Did I hear you say you love me
Well baby I've got to know
‘Cause if you really really love me
You've got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression
By showing me warm expressions
Put me in the right direction
With tender love and affection
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Did I hear you say you need me
Well baby tell me the truth
‘Cause if you really really need me
My sweetness here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing
‘Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying
And I'll be yours without delaying
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside 

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Sounds so good
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you 

Did I hear you say you want me 
Now please don't give me no mess
‘Cause if you really really want me
You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me ‘til I beg don't stop it
‘Cause I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside 

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Baby, if you love me let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me let me hear you say
I love you
And if you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you
