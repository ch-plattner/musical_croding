
Grab your coat and get your hat,
Leave your worry at the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear that pitter pat
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
'Cause this rover, crossed over

If I never had a cent
I'll be as rich as Rockfeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade
Because this rover, it crossed over

If I never had a cent
I'll be as loaded as old Rockfeller
With that gold dust 'round my feet
On the sunny side of the street
On the side, at that side of the street that is sunny
