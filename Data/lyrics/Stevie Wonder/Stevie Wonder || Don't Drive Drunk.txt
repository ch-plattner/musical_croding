He and his wife have had problems
That he's played off like nothing's wrong
'Til he comes home from work early
Just to find the girl is gone
Oh but he gets into the cupboard
Picks out that bottle of gin
Drinks like there's no tomorrow
And decides to take a spin

No don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

Teenager at a live party
Says, "give me one for the road"
But he's already so inebriated
If you lit a smoke he'd explode
But bartender says, "I don't think so"
Young one says, "I can deal"
Staggering out he says, "check you all later"
But I really don't think he will

No don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
[Repeat]

Boy out with girl on their first date
Gets pulled over by the law
Officer says, "hey can't you drive straight
Or have you been drinking alcohol?"
Boy says, "man are you crazy?"
Cop says, "hey then walk this line"
But results from the breathalizer
Proves he's charged with D.U.I.

No don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
