
There's a place I can go 
When the tension is high and I'm feeling low 
In a falsh I can be in an another space 
As a different me, have a new id. 

I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head 
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head 

There's no rich, there's no poor 
Everything is love no such thing as "war" 
There's no black and no white 
Rainbow colors they, dress the day and nights, life's paradise 

I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head 
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head 

It's amazing how the mind 
Can do what you want it to 
It can take you to a time 
Where you'll want to stay forever 
Feeling overlasting pleasure 

If your life's in a place 
That you can hardly bare 
Come along with me to mental ecxtasy 

I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head 
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head

Whatsoever things are pure 
Whatsoever things are honest 
Whatsoever things are true [repeat]
