
Some folks say a man is made out of mud
But a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
muscle and blood, skin and bones
a mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born when the sun didn't shine
I became a man who who would work the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
The foreman said: "well, a-bless my soul"

I was born in drizzling rain
Fighting and Trouble was my middle name
When I come around, you better step aside
A lot of man didn't and a lot man died (Yes they did)

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store. (Yes sing it one time with me)

Sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
