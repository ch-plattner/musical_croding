
Excuse me please your majesty 
I chance this moment nervously 
To share with you a fantasy 
That I have lived inside of me 

And it is so pretty 
And it is so fine 
Its the kind you'd love to last you 
Until the end of time 

We've talked of love, we've talked of life 
And what would make the world so nice 
We've walked the sand by lover's sea 
I've held your body close to me 

And it is so pretty 
How I'd love to know 
For if I had a chance to hold you 
I'd never let you go 

You're my queen in the black 
With your time-stopping body 
Queen in the black 
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl 
Queen in the black 
With your voice that's sweet as candy 
Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 

There's not a day that passes by 
That I don't have you on my mind 
If this ain't love I have inside 
Then my heart's telling me a lie 
Cause it feels so special 
And it feels so right 
And if I could I know I'd love you 
For the rest of my life 

You're my queen in the black 
With your time-stopping body 
Queen in the black 
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl 
Queen in the black 
With your voice that's sweet as candy 
Queen in the black 
With your soft and sexy lips, babe 
Queen in the black 
I love the way you move your body 

Queen in the black 
You know you are nothing less than royalty 
Queen in the black 
Oh, I'll place you on a throne, girl 
Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 
Queen in the black 
With your time-stopping body 
Queen in the black 
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl 
Queen in the black 
With your voice that's sweet as candy 
Queen in the black 
With your valentine smile, girl 
Queen in the black 
With your soft and sexy lips, babe 
Queen in the black 
Love the way you move your body 
Queen in the black 
You know you are nothing less than royalty 
Queen in the black 
You know I'll place you on a throne, girl 
Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 
Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 
Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 
Queen in the black 
With your valentine smile, girl 
Queen in the black 
With your soft and sexy lips, babe

Love the way you move your body 
Queen in the black 
You know you are nothing less than royalty 
Queen in the black 
You know I'll place you on a throne, girl 
Queen in the black

Queen in the black 
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on 
Queen in the black

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

With your eyes that hypnotize, girl
