When I look at love I look at you
Look at me and you'll see
Love is burning inside of me
But the flame needs you to make it brighter
Give to me what you see
Make the moment a lifetime

Give your love
Give your love to only me
Give the chance I need
To let you see
You will be the other half of me

Give your love
Give your love and lead the way
Turn the cold of winter into May
Through a thousand winters
Love will stay

We'll build a dream
Just big enough for two, girl
We'll build a world that's made of only love
You'll be the one
Who makes my life worth living
You'll keep me strong
When I stumble and I fall

So, Give your love
Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around

Everyday that we're apart I cry girl
When you're gone all I long for
Is when you'll be near me
Everyday a thousand times I die girl
Far away how I pray there is some way
You'll let me...

Give your love
Ohh, Give your love your tears and pain
I will be your shelter through the rain
Through the storm my love for you won't change

So, Give your love
Give your love and give your heart
Never, never will love let us part
We were meant to be lovers from the start

So la la la
Ohh, Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around

Angie give your love
Oh, give your love, don't make me cry
