
Such a lovely world was made for you and me 
Wondrous life for us to taste, touch, smell, hear, and see 
But one glance from outside looking at our world state 
Clearly displays we don't appreciate it at all 

Rain your love down won't you rain down your love 
Let it drench us like the sun from above 

Such ability inside you and me 
Made to do anything and be all we can be 
But one bird's eye view at us does show, oh it shows 
That against God's Plan we've let it go, oh no 

Rain your love down won't you rain down your love 
Let it drench us like the sun from above 
Rain your love down let it rain down today 
So that it may wash all our sins away 

You'd think the signs would make a difference, 
Oh, make a difference 

You'd think fire next time instead of rain 
Would cause us to make a change 
The world has gone insane 

Rain your love down won't you rain down your love 
Let it drench us like the sun from above 
Rain your love down let it rain down today 
So that it may wash all our sins away, let it rain 

Rain your love down let it pour on us, please 
Cleansing us from hunger, hate, war, and greed 
Rain your love down, won't you let it start over again 
So we can live up to your Master Plan 

Rain your love down, oh won't you let it start 
Wash the wicked minds and the... 
I know they're sick, you know they're sick at heart, yeah 
Rain your love down won't you let it rain 
Rid this world of drugs, disease, crime, and pain 

Clear our spirits give our minds new software 
With your lesson on honor, respect, trust, and care 
Rain your love down I beg for human sake 
For only you can get us out of this state 

Rain your love down on all mankind 
Cause we are out of order and so out of line
