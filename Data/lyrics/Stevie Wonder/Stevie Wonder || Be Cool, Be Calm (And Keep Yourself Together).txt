Girl I've been crying ever since you left
My mama told me get a hold of yourself and
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together
She said
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together

Sugar plum you really gone
And it just don't help to cry
So I wipe my tears away the other day
And hung my handkerchief up to dry

Then I changed my style put on a smile
And went out to face the world
The smile I wear say ha I don't care
That I just lost my girl

But I still get that old yearning
Can't be cool when my heart is burning
I still get that old feeling
Can't be calm when my head is reeling

I say, Mother dear, see here see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said but babes give up be man enough

To Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
That what my mama said
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together

Sugar pie you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mama said
Don't loose your head son
It just don't help to weep

Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender
To what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd
And ha I love fun lots
But it's a big disguise

'Cause I still hear my heart pounding
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still hear my heart purring
Hard to ne calm when my inside's stirring

I say, Mother dear, see here see here
Tell me now what way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so
She said whenever you're blue whatever you do

Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
That what my mama said
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
Maintain yourself
