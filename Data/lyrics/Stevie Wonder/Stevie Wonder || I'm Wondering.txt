
Jimmy was your sweetie pie
Your precious one 
And I knew you used to love
The very ground he walked upon
One day, Jim's papa told him 
Things were looking down 
And they packed up everything
They owned and left this little old town
Each tear I dried for you,
The closer our lives grew, 
I fell in love it's true 
And you say you love me, too

Well, don't you know I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him?
Ooh,Baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby

But, baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering, 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved Jim?

The day you see his face again
Or hear his voice
I don't want to be a loser 
If you have to make a choice
Like a puppet to a string
To you, girl, I'm attached 
And I know I'd be in trouble 
If he came and took you back
I feel so insecure 
In my mind, I can picture 
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure

Oh baby I'm wondering 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me 
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering, 
Sure enough, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?
Ooh Baby 

I can't stop loving you, baby, 
I can't stop loving you , no 
I can't stop loving you, baby

I feel so insecure 
In my mind, I
Can picture
Losing you for sure 
And the pain I can't endure
Baby, I'm worried,
Really, really worried
I wanna make you happy
Really truly happy

Oh baby I'm wondering, 
Little girl, I'm wondering 
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering ...
