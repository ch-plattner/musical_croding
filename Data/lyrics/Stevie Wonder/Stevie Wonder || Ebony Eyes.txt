
She's a Miss Beautiful Supreme 
A girl that other wish that they could be 
If there's seven wonders of the world 
Then I know she's gotta be number one 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

She's the sunflower of nature's seeds 
A girl that some men only find in their dreams 
When she smiles it seems the stars all know 
Cause one by one they start to light up the sky 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

A girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

When she starts talking soft and sweet 
Like birds of spring her words all seem to sing 
With a rhythm that is made of love 
And the happiness that she only brings 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

A girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

Yeah, yea, yea 
.......yeah 
Pretty black beauty 
Yeah, yea yeah 
Yea, yea, yeah, yea, yea, yeah 
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony ey---es 
Ebony ey--es
