The day's been hot and sunny
Evening's about to take control
The sky is painting pictures 
Stirring up love bliss in our souls
The breeze carries the fragrance
Of the sweetest symphony as it blows through your hair
Better can be nowhere

Our voices turn to whispers
Blending with rhythms of the night
The nightingales sing a love song
Glancing down at us in their flight
The moisture brings forth magic
That permeates the midnight air
To kiss the love we share, are

Raindrops, passionate raindrops
The kind of rain that writes they're 
So in love on our skin
Raindrops, that we hope wont stop
Cooling the red hot love that we are making

Raindrops, passionate raindrops
That brings out all the fire that we have within
Raindrops cover every spot
Right to the last drop
We want all of you and then
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love won't end

Somewhere in our doing
Trying to make our bodies one
We fall prey to moon dreams
Till awaken by the morning sun
Still disorientated
I feel something warm on my face
Coupled by your embrace
We gaze in awe and wonder
As if we can't believe it's so
Just that taste of heaven
Has got us longing for much more
We lie there impatient
Anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in
And the clouds to burst again, to give us

Raindrops, passionate raindrops
The kind of rain that writes they're 
So in love on our skin
Raindrops, that we hope wont stop
Cooling the red hot love that we are making

Raindrops, passionate raindrops
That brings out all the fire that we have within
Raindrops cover every spot
Right to the last drop
We want all of you and then
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love won't end
