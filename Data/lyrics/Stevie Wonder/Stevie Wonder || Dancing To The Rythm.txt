Lonely, my life used to be lonely 
Lonely as the single lonely number one 
Lonely like a lonely sun 
With not even one iota to shine upon 

Crying, deep inside I was crying 
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed 
Carrying with it my lonely soul 
With not even a clue of who, 
where or what I would become 

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody 
To hold me, control me, show me what I should 
do with my broken life 
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light 
inside my body 
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and 
you in my, my, my, my li-li-life 

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love 
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love 
Forever greateful for your love 

Money, oh how did I have money 
Enough to last me from the start til the end of time 
With some more to leave behind 
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress 
I can, feel the very presence of your love here 
Though I've never seen the pleasure of your smile 
No, I've never touched your hand 
And yet you've given me eternal happiness 

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody 
To hold me, control me, show me what I should 
do with my broken life 
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light 
inside my body 
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you in my, 
my, my, my li-li-life 

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love 
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love 
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love 
[Repeat]
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody 
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do 
with my broken life 

But oh, was I lifted when I let God's light 
inside my body 
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you 
in my, my, my, my li-li-life 

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love 
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love 
Giving all praises of your sweet, sweet love 
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love 
[Repeat]
