
Staring right at 2000 AD 
As if mankind's atrocities to man has no history 
But just a glance at life in 2000 BC 
We find traces of man's inhumanity to man 
There's no mystery 

All for one, one for all 
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights 
Unless we heed the call 
Me for you, you for me 
There's no chance of world salvation 
Less the conversation's peace 

We can't pause, watch and say "no" this can't be 
When there's a plan by any means to have 
Cleansing of one's ethnicity 
And we shouldn't act as if we don't hear nor see 
Like the holocaust of six million Jews and 
A hundred and fifty million blacks during slavery 

All for one, one for all 
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights 
Unless we heed the call 
Me for you, you for me 
There's no chance of world salvation 
Less the conversation's peace 

When publicly or privately convened 
May love, positivity and life's preservation 
be the basic theme 
And shouuld you put your trust in some 
prophet in life 
Give him trust but your faith must stay 
with the one 
Who gave the ultimate sacrifice for... 

All for one, one for all 
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights 
Unless we heed the call 
Me for you, you for me 
Ther's no chance of world salvation 
Less the conversation is peace [repeat]
