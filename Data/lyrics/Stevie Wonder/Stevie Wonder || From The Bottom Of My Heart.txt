
Me and my heart took a 
Vow from the start and a 
Vow to my heart I never break

Seasons may come and the 
Seasons may go but know
Through every time and space
My love will always stay forever and always

From the bottom of my heart, I love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long I'll love you
Try forever that's how long I'll feel this way

Me and my heart got a 
Promise from the stars that they'd 
Keep this love burning endlessly

People will come just as 
People will go but know 
Whatever life has in store 
Through all eternity you will have my love for always

From the bottom of my heart, I love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long I'll love you
Try forever that's how long I'll feel this way

Yes, forever is how long my love will stay
Forever is a long, long time 
But so what?
