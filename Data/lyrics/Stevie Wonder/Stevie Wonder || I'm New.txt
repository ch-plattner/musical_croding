Try to envision you as the oldest living someone
Being every night and day all alone
Going through ages and ages, places and spaces
With never finding that someone to call your own

Like a treasure chest of dreams long forgotten
Hidden for good in a stolen lost and found
But just when fate was calling quits
Love appeared in the midst of despair, came and turned your life around

I'm new, new like the first day of spring
New like a nightingale that's just learned to sing
I'm new, new like the very start of dawn
Like a child that's first born with your love, I'm new

You're standing amongst a crowd of six billion people
Crying out for help, but no one understands
Cause much to your dismay, you've been taken far away
To a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man

Where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty
And a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame
But at the very instant all was through, lady lucks appears, says "love can do"
And changed you like a Christian who's been born again

I'm new, new like the fresh morning dew
New like a work of art that's finally through
I'm new, new like a first flight of a dove
So safe and secure with your love, I'm new

Love took a long time coming to me
But I've gotta say
I owe my thanks to him for sending you my way, hey

Cause I'm new, new like the first winter snow
Like the start of forever, with infinity to go
I'm new, new like the birth of the sun
Forever young I will be

Cause with your love, I'm new
New like from a restful night of sleep
New like a starving man that's had food to eat

I'm new, nothing compares nor can compete
Sharing with you the sweetness of your love, I'm new
