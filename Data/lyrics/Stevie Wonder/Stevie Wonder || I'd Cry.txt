
I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry
If it can't be me and you
Lonely tears I'd shed
I'd hang my head

I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

Oh sugar baby I love you so
I need you more than you know
And if I ever had to let you go
I'd sit around I'd break right down

I'd cry
Deep down in my heart
I'd cry
If you leave me tears would start
I'd cry
Everyday that we're apart
I'd cry a river
Don't you leave me ever

Baby you release in me
Flame of love burns within me
I'd be sad as I can be
If I had to do without you

I'd cry
If you ever put me down
I'd cry
If you ever play around
I'd cry
It will fall to the ground
I'd fall apart
If you break my heart

Oh, I love you love you
More than words can say
Love you more and more each day
If you ever ever walk away
I couldn't go on
I'd sit at home

I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry
