There's a girl in my life about 4'10" 
She's the one who brings me morning joy 
And brings me joy when my day ends 
She says my life will never have no problems 
That her love cannot fix 
And she proves her worth true 
Every time she goes into her love bag of tricks 

She's got everything I want 
Everything I need 
And if she ain't got it 
She knows how to find the remedy 

And she tells me 

Come let me make your love come down 
[Repeat 7 times]

She says you'll never worry in your life 
As long as you come and let me 
Make your love come down 
I call her Miss Satisfaction 
Cause she keeps me satisfied 
She gets my automatic smile 
When she whispers Steveland, I love you, I love you, 
I love you 

Such a lovely world is my life 
Since that girl has come inside 
And everyday that I live 
I'm gonna do my best to keep her satisfied 

Our love will never have no problem 
That the both of us can't fix 
Cause like glue to a stamp 
Like gum on a shoe 
She and I are going to stick 

She's got everything I want 
Everything I need 
And if she ain't got it 
She knows how to find the remedy 

And she tells me 

Come let me make your love come down 
[Repeat 7 times]
