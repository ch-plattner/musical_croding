
I took a worthless trip 
Down life's avenue 
Just to try to find a way to smile again 
While I was on my way 
I met a wise man who said 
That happiness you only find within 
I learned my lesson then 

So I go sailing 
Through the rivers of my mind 
I go sailing 
Be surprised what you can find 
I go sailing 
Through the rivers of my mind 
Take a chance on your mind 
Be surprised what you'll find 

I took a friend's advice 
Who said go up and away 
Take the magic of a mystery tour 
But I felt so all alone 
Though I could almost touch the stars 
I started missing things I touched before 
The tour was such a bore 

So I go sailing 
Through the rivers of my mind 
I go sailing 
Be surprised what you can find 
I go sailing 
Through the rivers of my mind 
Take a chance on your mind 
Be surprised what you'll find
