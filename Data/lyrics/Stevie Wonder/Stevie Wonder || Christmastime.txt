It's Christmastime and its magic is here
It's Christmastime and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmas air
While the church bell chimes
And there's joy everywhere

Some precious gift lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year
