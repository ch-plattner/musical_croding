
When you believe in a feeling, 
And it's holding you back from my love, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

When you insist on excluding 
The tenderness that's in my kiss, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

If you try to display an emotion, 
That will contradict itself, 
You will find your heart just sitting 
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf 

Should you depend on an outlet, 
Through which an escape can be found, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

If you don't see there's no way out, 
Just no way of getting around me, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

Yes, you know the plans I am making, 
Are intended to capture you, 
So you practice false reactions, 
To delay the things I do, the things I do, 
things I do, foolish you 
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad 

There's no reward in detouring 
My deep sincerity. 
Especially since what you're feeling, 
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me 

Before you discover the feeling, 
You've tried very hard to hide, 
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

But when you can find just a small space, 
To let my love live in your mind, 
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll 
have it good girl
