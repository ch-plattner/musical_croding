
Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
Don't you know I do

Mrs. Jones won't you put my darling on the phone
Let me tell her
I shouldn't have left her
Cause I love her just as long as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly
Little Jack Horner in the corner loves his Christmas pie

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Let me speak to your daughter
If she gives me one more chance
I'm gonna love her like I oughta

I can't forget (I can't forget)
That lacey dress
That she used to wear for me
We'd sit under the apple tree
And I remember (I remember, I remember)
That night in September
When my baby cried and cried cause I left her side

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed
For stringing her along
Like a playboy with a play toy
And she loved me just as strong as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly (birdies love to fly)
Little Miss Muffet loves her tuffet
Babies love to cry (babies love to cry)

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Please don't hang up that receiver
If she heard one sweet word
She'd know I would never leave her

Baby, baby, baby
She's the best
Oh the very best
Everything worth living for
Everything that I adore

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do
