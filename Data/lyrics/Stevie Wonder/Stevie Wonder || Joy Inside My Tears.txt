
I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know 

And baby that's you - you - you
Made life's his*to*ry
Caue you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears 

I've alwys felt that tomorroqw is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby, baby it's you - you - you
Made life's his*to*ry
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears 

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be
He - y, you brought some joy inside my tears
Gotta tell you
You - you - you made life's his*to*ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
- you brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears 

You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his*to*ry
- you you you made life's his*to*ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
- No-body ever thought it would be
You have done what no one thought could be

You brought some joy inside my 
Tears
