
Would you like to go with me 
Down my dead end street 
Would you like to come with me 
To Village Ghetto Land 

See the people lock their doors 
While robbers laugh and steal 
Beggars watch and eat their meal -from garbage cans 

Broken glass is everywhere 
It's a bloody scene 
Killing plagues the citizens 
Unless they own police 

Children play with rusted cars 
Sores cover their hands 
Politicians laugh and drink-drunk to all demands 

Families buying dog food now 
Starvation roams the streets 
Babies die before they're born 
Infected by the grief 

Now some folks say that we should be 
Glad for what we have 
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land 

Village Ghetto Land
