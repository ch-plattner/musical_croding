Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

Somebody tried to tell me
That you've been running around
They must have you mixed up
With another girl in town

Cause as sure as I know
That a broken heart has got its baby
That how sure I know
Baby I can claim
That I've got you

Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

In a thousand little ways
I can tell you really love me (really love me)
In a thousand little thing you do

I can tell you really love me (really love me)

And as sure as I know
That a crying child has got his tears
That's how sure I know
I can love you with no fear
Cause I've got you

Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

And as sure as I know
That a singing bird has got his song
That's how sure I know
Baby I cant be wrong to say that I've got you

I've got you
I've got you
