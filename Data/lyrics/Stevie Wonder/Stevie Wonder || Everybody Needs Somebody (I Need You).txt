
Life on your own, don't really make you free
You can't put your arms around a memory
A little bit of soul, is worth more than gold

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

The lonely days and nights were paved with dreams
I've loved and lost and I do believe
A little bit of soul, is worth more than gold

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

We got to get together babe
