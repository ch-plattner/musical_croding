
Yeah, ah
Ah the language of music
Is known around the world
It's the language that's understood
By people everywhere
(Yes everywhere)

Soon you'll hear the trumpets begin to blow
Ah listen to the trombones playing way down low
Well everybody seems to be playing
With a lot of soul
Fellas so you mind if I join in and play along

Everybody yeah

Just a little bit of drum

Ahh I think the drummer has found a new groove
Listen close and you will hear the saxophone move

If you're feelin' what you hearing well don't you know
Yeah, ah it's just the music that friendly music talking
To your soul

It can make you blue or make you feel so glad
It's best way of talking that man has ever had

Everybody around the world sing with me now

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
