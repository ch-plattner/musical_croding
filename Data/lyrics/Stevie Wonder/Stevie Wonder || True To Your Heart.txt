
Baby, I knew at once that
you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know
that I'm your destiny
Though you're unsure
Why fight the tide
Don't think so much
Let your heart decide

Baby, I see your future
and it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes and see
you searching for a sign
But you'll never fall
Till you let go
Don't be so scared
Of what you don't know

True to you heart
You must be true
to your heart
That's when the
heavens will part
And baby, shower you
with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell
you no lies
And when you're true
to your heart
I know it's gonna lead
you straight to me
(Got to be true
To your heart)

Someone you know is on
your side, can set you free
I can do that for you if
you believe in me
Why second-guess
What feels so right
Just trust your heart
And you'll see the light

True to you heart
You must be true
to your heart
That's when the
heavens will part
And baby, shower you
with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell
you no lies
And when you're true
to your heart
I know it's gonna lead
you straight to me

(Ya know it's true)
Your heart knows
what's good for you
(Good for you)
Let your heart show
you the way
(Ya know it's true)
It'll see you through
(Got to be true
To your heart)

Girl, my heart is driving
me to where you are
Well, you can take both hands off
the wheel and still get far
Be swept away
Enjoy the ride
You won't get lost
With your heart to guide you

True to you heart
You must be true
to your heart
That's when the
heavens will part
And baby, shower you
with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true
to your heart
I know it's gonna lead
you straight to me

True to you heart
You must be true
to your heart
That's when the
heavens will part
And baby, shower you
with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart will tell you no lies
And when it's true
to your heart
I know it's gonna lead
you straight to me
(Got to be true
To your heart)

When things are getting' crazy
And you don't know
where to start
Keep on believin', baby
Just be true to your heart
When all the world
around you
It seems to fall apart
Keep on believin', baby
Just be true to your heart
