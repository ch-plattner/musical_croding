
She wrecked my life
Cursed my pride
Smashed my dreams
Then threw me aside oh baby yeah

Holy only blessed me when she put me down
Heaven smiled on me when you I found
You gave this life of mine a bright new chance
Now Beverly's is back to upset our plans

For each tear that she may cry
It's too late now
(To late now)
For each sweet little lullaby
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

She can beg and plead swear up what she needs
But I'll leave you never, I love you forever

You pick me up from by the wayside
Wiped the dust from my walked on pride
You are the one that patched up all my dreams
Showed me what a true heart really means

For that baby talk, she talks
It's too late now
(Too late now)
For that wiggly walk she walks
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I'll never never never leave my baby's side

With you I remain
She can't break the chains
That binds us together
I'll love you forever

I love you, I love you, I love you love baby

Beverly might as well go on her away
Her magic touch faded with yesterday

You're the sweetest thing under the sun
And now that I found you
I'm sure holding on

'Cause I love you baby
Really need you baby
Really want you baby
Sure ain't gonna leave you baby

And I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

('Cause I'm more than happy, girl, I'm satisfied)
'Cause I love you baby, and I need you baby
(And I never, never, never leave your side)
Ooh, don't go and I love you, sure ain't gonna leave you baby
('Cause I'm more than happy girl, I'm satisfied)
And I more than love you, said I need you baby
(And I more than love you girl, I idolize you)
Ooh, have mercy I love you
