There we were two lonely souls 
Existing from day to day 
Feeling love would never 
Come our way 

Watching lover share their bliss 
Sadly wishing only if 
Believing that we had to live 
Life like this 

But Like a bolt of lightning 
As when two stormy clouds collide 
We made a joyful happening 
To our lives 

Now we're as happy as can be 
Me loving you and you loving me 
Two hearts intertwined 
Which makes us one of a kind 

Feeling the charge of a love evermore 
Knowing that love is enough to live for 
It feels so fine 
Sharing love one of a kind 

One of a kind now baby 
Your love and mine, such ecstasy 
One of kind sweet darling 
The only way love is meant to be 

United love so fine 
Living in love one of a kind 
It feels nothing but fine 
Sharing our love one of kind 
-Harmonica Solo- 

If we had a second chance 
At living a second time 
We'd change everything but our love 
In our lives 

'Cause like a big disaster 
Lost in a never-ending night 
We light a light of magic 
Now we're as happy as can be 
Me loving you and you loving me 
Two hearts intertwined 
Which makes us one of a kind 

Feeling the charge of a love evermore 
Knowing that love is enough to live for 
It feels so fine 
Sharing love one of a kind 

One of a kind, now baby 
Your love and mind, such ecstasy 
One of a kind, sweet darling 
The only way love is meant to be 
[Repeat]
