
There are people who have let the problems of today 
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way 
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find 
You should talk it over to Him 
He'll give you peace of mind 
When you feel your life's too hard 
Just go have a talk with God 

Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend 
Never communicating with the One who lives within 
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down 
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around 
When you feel your life's too hard 
Just go have a talk with God 

Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world 
For solving problems of all men, women, little boys and girls 
When you feel your life's too hard 
Just go have a talk with God 
When you feel your life's too hard 
Just go have a talk with God 
When your load's too much to bear 
Just go talk to God He cares 
I know he does 

When you feel your life's too hard 
Just go have a talk with God 
thank you 
thank you very much
