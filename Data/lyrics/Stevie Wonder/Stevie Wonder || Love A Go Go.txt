
We've got love a go go
Faithful as the dawn
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow it may be gone

We've got love a go go
We've got love to spare
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow we may not care

Maybe you'll be true
And never say we're through
But lover love me now as though
You really mean you'll always love me so

We've got love a go go
Let's not wonder why
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow our love may die

Maybe you'll be true
And never say we're through
But lover love me now as though
You really mean you'll always love me so

We've got love a go go
Let's not wonder why
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow our love may die

We've got love
Love a go go
We've got love
Love a go go
