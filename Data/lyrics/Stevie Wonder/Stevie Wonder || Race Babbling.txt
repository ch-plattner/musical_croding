
This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The endâ€™s unravelling

Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
Both we don't need you

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The end's unravelling
This world is moving much too fast
You can't conceive the nucleus of all
Begins inside a tiny seed
And what you see as insignificant

Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
Both we don't need you

This world is moving much to fast
This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
They're space travelling

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The end's unravelling
This world is moving much to fast
This world is moving much to fast

They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
They're space travelling
