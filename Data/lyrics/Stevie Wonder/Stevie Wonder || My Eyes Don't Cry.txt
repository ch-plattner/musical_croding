
I was a lonely no one 
Living in a vacuum as life's debris 
Victimized as one whose self deprivation 
Had made for my outer insecurity 

I was a he ain't nothin' 
Living in the slums of love's misery 
Starving from the lack of sweet affection 
'Til you came to rescue me 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Since you walk through my door 
I don't have to no longer be blue 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Now that love's touched my soul 
All my lonely nights alone are through 

I was a Mr. Lonely 
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day 
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened 
But then your love sunshined my way 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Since you walk through my door 
I don't have to no longer be blue 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Now that love's touched my soul 
All my lonely nights alone are through 

I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
[repeat]

My life was without reason 
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time 
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow 
Until you saved this life of mine 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Since you walk through my door 
I don't have to no longer be blue 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
Now that love's touched my soul 
All my lonely nights alone are through 

I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 

My eyes don't cry no more 
My heart don't ache no more 
My nights are not lonely no more 
My tears don't flow no more 
My eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry no more
