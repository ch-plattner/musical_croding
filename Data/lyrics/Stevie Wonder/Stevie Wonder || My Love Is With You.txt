I was just walking down the street 
Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet 
Yet what happened so tragically 
Really makes for no sense at all 
Suddenly two guys confronted me 
Saying I was in the wrong turf, angrily 
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray 
I started to turn to go back 
They up and blew me away 

My love is with you where ever you are 
My love is with, where ever you are - [repeat]

Though my life they've taken 
They can't take what we've shared 
Spread the love I've given 
And I'll be there 

I was out playing with my friends 
You know, doing silly things that kids do at ten 
But the crossfire I was caught in 
Should not have been in the first place 
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech 
Someone yelled "nobody gets away with dissent me" 
Across the street a man pulled his nine 
Everybody started to run 
A shower of bullets rang out 
Mistakenly my life was done, oh 

My love is with you where ever you are 
My love is with, where ever you are - [repeat]

Though my life they've taken 
They can't take what we've shared 
Spread the love I've given 
I'll be there 

My love is with you where ever you are 
My love is with, where ever you are - [repeat]

When you're joyful 
When you're lonely 
When you're happy 
When tears are streaming right down your face 
In the morning 
In the noon time 
In the evening 
In the wee wee hours of the night time hour 
In the summer 
In the springtime 
In the autumn 
In the cold long winter, winter nights 
My love is with you 
My love is with you my best friend 
My love is with you my brother 
My love is with you my sister 
My love is with you my mother 
My love is with you my father 

I'm with you - [repeat]
Ban the hand gun - chant
