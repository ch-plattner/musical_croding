Oh yellow moon you make me think of home
Down in Arkansas where I was raised and born
Oh muddy street where I used to play
I think of leaving here and coming home one day

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

Deep in her heart though she won't tell me so
There's something troubling her
And I know I know
She dreams of rocky hills
Pretty little corn fields
And sitting 'round that mighty oak
Talking to those friendly folks

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of hers oh yeah
My little heart shares

One of these days
I'm gonna take my own two hands
Build us a cottage
On that old southern land

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

I'm coming back oh yeah
Back to old little rock, hey

I'm coming home yeah yeah
Back to that old little rock, ha
Gonna stay there yeah
Ain't going nowhere

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares
