We are supposed to be sisters and brothers
But all we do is constantly dog one another
We are supposed to act as each other's cover
But we keep at each other's throat
Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it ain't no joke
We're at each other's throat - Aowl, Aowl

We are supposed to spread love and not evil
But we've been acting more like heathens than people
Treating our fellow-man far worse than illegal
Cause we keep at each other's throat
Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it ain't no joke
We're at each other's throat - Aowl, Aowl

Ut oh, 11 o'clock pm and here's the news
Another fatality caused by a family feud
Charged, tried, sentenced by the jury of a brother's gun
Made sister's fiancee's wedding never to be sung
He didn't like the way he treated the girl
So the boy played God, pow, he ended his world

He made a plea for temporary insanity
But left his sister insane permanently
This ain't new, this stuff happens everyday
Somebody doesn't like someone so they blow them away
Too fast for reason, too quick to negotiate

Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late
Jealousy for power, greed for possession
Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression
Speaking of which I'm truly not impressed
So if seeing is believin'- I don't wanna see the mess

Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser
As if for negativity we got the vapors
Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor
Cause we are too busy at each other's throat

Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it ain't no joke
We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl
[Repeat]
