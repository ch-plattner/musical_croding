
I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world

Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl

And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true,
Oh ho ho

When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me

Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
