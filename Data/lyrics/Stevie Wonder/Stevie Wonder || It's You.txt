I look inside my crystal ball of desire
And know why rapid beats my heart
I see the spark, I feel the flame of the fire
Letting me know love wants to start
No more playing around
No more waiting around for the special one to come
No more wearing a frown
No more tears coming down 'cause I know what I want
And I want what I know

Is you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you, nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me
([Background:] Me for you and you for me)
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited my life would be undone
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you 

I look behind and what I sight is the mire
So very lonely was my heart
I look ahead I hear the sound of the choir
Singing that love will never part
No more hearing the sound of the rain coming down
No more I can't see the sun
No more hurting for fun 'cause the moment has come
When I know what I want
And I want what I know

Is you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you, nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me
([Background:] Me for you and you for me)
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited my life would be undone
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you
'Cause Baby

It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you, nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me
([Background:] Me for you and you for me)
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited my life would be undone
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you
'Cause Baby

It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you, nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me
([Background:] Me for you and you for me)
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited my life would be undone
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you
'Cause Baby it's you
