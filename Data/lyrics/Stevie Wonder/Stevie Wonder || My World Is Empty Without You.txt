
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much

My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

From this whole world, I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

I need your love more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe

My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us, no more exists
And each time that darkness falls,
It finds me alone with these four walls

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe

Without you, babe, without you, babe
