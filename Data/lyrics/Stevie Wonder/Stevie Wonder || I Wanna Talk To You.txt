Lord, Lordy, Lordy
Standing here on my own side
Waitin' Fo' the floor
Your world's movin' fast
But still ends up a bore
Come on give me a little room na
Do you have to take it all
Yeah that's the way it is I guess
Then you're born with nothin' at all

Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
I wanna talk to you
I wanna talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
I wanna talk to you

Pick up my life at the table
Read about the way I could be
But I know I just ain't able
So I read about the real me
Who can I blame
For the way I am
I ain't never had one soul to help me
So I don't give a.......

Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
Watch that boy, watch that
I heard you thinkin'
I wanna talk to you
I wanna talk to you
Don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, boy I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
But you gotta find out what to do
I wanna talk to you sonny beau

Gotta woman that lov' me
Feed me beans ev'ry night
Twelve babies look up at me
Wid Big grey hungry eyes
Oh but I just can't complain
You see ya, said I ain't allowed
Oh but pretty soon will come a change
When I gain the biggest mouth

Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
I wanna talk to you
I wanna talk to you
Don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah boy , I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
I'm a show you what to do
I wanna talk to you

Hey don't wanna talk to you
What you mean by that boy
I don't wanna talk to you

Don't wanna talk to you
