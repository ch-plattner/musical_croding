
Hey there miss fine
Sweet little clinging vine
Your actions kind of show me you love me truly, yeah
You're warmer than July, sweet as apple pie
I can't let you know you're getting to me

Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
My papa used to say
"look child, look beyond a tender smile"
'Cause can't judge a book by it's lover

Girl, I'm sweet on you
Though you can't see through
this unconcerned expression I've been wearing
Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
And you can't judge a book by it's lover
Maybe my coldness is a mask, maybe your loving will last
But can't judge a book by it's cover

Somewhere beyond the skin, somewhere deep within
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves
And maybe we'll find something precious
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
Only time it's gonna show, only time will let us know
'Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
And you can't judge a book by it's lover
We've got to search each other's minds
We've got to read between the lines
Oh, take a different look
And make our hearts an open book
Oh, you can't judge a book by it's cover
No, no, no, no
And you can't judge a book by it's lover
