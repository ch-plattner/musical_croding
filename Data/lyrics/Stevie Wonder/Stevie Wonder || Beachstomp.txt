There is a dance that they do on the beach, yeah
It's called the beach stomp
And it's done with the feet, yeah
Well you kick just a little sand
Then you grab your partner by the hand

Catch a wave on the run
You're doing the beachstomp, yeah

Place your surf
Down to your side
They catch a big wave
Then begin to ride, yeah
But you grab a real tight grip
Get ready for the great big dip

Come on yeah and do the beachstomp with me
Yeah Yeah ah Yeah

Now the boys are there
With their transistor radios
And all of the girls
Are in their polka dot bikinis

If you wanna swing until two
I'll tell you what you can do
Grab a chick by the hand
And do the beachstomp

Now there is a dance that they do on the beach, yeah
It's called the beach stomp
And it's done with the feet, yeah
Well you kick just a little sand
Then you grab your partner by the hand

Everybody come on yeah yeah yeah
Do the beachstomp with me yeah yeah...
