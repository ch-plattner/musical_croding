
I opened my mind
Peace I could not find
Then something out of the blue
Said I needed you

Time swept me away
Merged me into pain
Then something out of the blue
Said you need me too

Oh what joy it brings to me
To know that heaven's wrong
Oh what gladness in my heart
To know my love's been found

Chains totalled my climb
I  was pushed out of time
Then something out of the blue
Said you'd see me through

Something out of the blue
Said you'd see me through

Now where hope was lost
Love's paid the cost
And something out of the blue
Said my love is you

Something out of the blue
Said I needed you

Something out of the blue
