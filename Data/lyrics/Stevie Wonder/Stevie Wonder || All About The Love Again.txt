That caused everyone to love each other
Oooh, oh yeah, it sounds good, to me
And if just a tiny pill can make us see
That we're truly sisters and brothers
Oooh, oh yeah it sounds so nice to me

And we would have no time to waste
On trivial things like war and pain
'Cos we'd be filled with joy to know
Through love the universe we've changed

To being all about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again
We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about the love again

What if someone came up with a lotion
That made everybody start sharing
Oooh, oh yeah it feels so good to me, yeah yeah
And some irresistible cologne that with one spray
There'd be no second thought of caring
Oooh, oh yeah it sounds so fine to me

And gone forever would be the day
Of hunger, homelessness and shame
'Cos for every single heart
The promise of endless love will reign

We'd be all about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again

We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about the love again

All about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again

We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about God's love again
