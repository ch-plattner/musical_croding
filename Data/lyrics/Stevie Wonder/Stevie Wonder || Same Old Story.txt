
Born to open for
Mankind nature's door
A life known by a few

And those who knew that shared
Their knowledge fewer cared
About what plants could do

For most felt it was mad to conceive
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we
But with instruments Bose would devise
Would take Science itself by a surprise, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again.

Born of slaves who died
Too soon to realize
The need his life would be

Selflessy he gave
His wisdom to a way
Where first no minds would see

He said if farm land was to be rich
We must plant crops to replenish it
But it took him persuasion and tests
To convince them Canver's way was best, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again.
