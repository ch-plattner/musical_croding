Skeletons in your closet
Itchin' to come outside
Messin' with your conscience
In a way your face can't hide

Oh things are gettin' real funky
Down at the old corral
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'
It's the stinkin' lies you tell

[Bridge]
What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white lie turns into a black one

So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're getting ready to know

It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turned up the heater
An' a it's gettin' ready to pop

Crevices in your pantry
Now what do we have in here
Havin' a day time nightmare
Has always been your biggest fear

Oh things are gettin' real crucial
Up the old wazoo
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?
When the culprit's y-o-u

[Bridge]
What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white lie turns into a black one

So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're gettin' ready to know

It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turning the heater
An' a it's gettin' ready to pop

It's gettin' ready to seep
You're gettin' ready to freak
Somebody done picked up the talk box
And gettin' ready to speak

It's gettin' ready to jive
It's gettin' ready to gel
Somebody done gone let the lid off
And it's gettin' ready to smell

They're gettin' ready to deal
You're gettin' ready to ill
Somebody done just dropped the big dime
And they're gettin' ready to squeal

It's gettin' ready to turn
We're gettin' ready to learn
Somebody done fired up the brimstone
And you're gettin' ready to burn

It's gettin' ready to shake
You're gettin' ready to ache
Somebody done snitched to the news crew
And it's gettin' ready to break

You're gettin' ready to lie
They're gettin' ready to spy
Somebody' s been put on the hot seat
And you're gettin' ready to fry
