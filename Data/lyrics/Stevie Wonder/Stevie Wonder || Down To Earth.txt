
Down to earth once again
I've been away too long
I got lost but then I came home again
Oh where I belong

Down to earth just in time
To the love I failed to see
I gave up the dream for a change of scene
Now I'm back where I should be

Down to earth, down to earth
All that I lost I have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Whithout your love around

I got lost in the crowd
That's the price I had to pay
Cause I couldn't find what I left behind
Till love showed me the way

Down to earth down to earth
All that i lost i have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Without your love around

Welcome home little fool
And it's been a long hard time
From a world unreal to the things I feel
Well love was waiting all the time

Down to earth,down to earth
Down, Down to earth
