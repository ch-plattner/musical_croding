Oh, people let me tell you
No matter how far I travel
No matter how far I roam
There's no other girl in the whole wide world
Sweet as the girl I, I got at home

Woah and I love that girl so
(Oh, I love that girl so)
Yeah, I need that girl, children
(Oh, I need that girl so)

Let me tell you, I love that girl so
(Oh, I love that girl so)
And I call that girl Pearl
Sweetest girl in the world
(Sweetest girl in the world, love that girl Pearl)

Sweet young thing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sweet sixteen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Props I can't afford to loose
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

She's the only thing
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That stands between
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Me and
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The twelfth street blues
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Woah and I love that girl so, have mercy
Oh I love that girl so
I need that girl so
(Oh, I need that girl so)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I love that girl so, have mercy
Oh I love that girl so
I'm talkin' 'bout Pearl
Sweetest girl in the world
(Sweetest girl in the world, love that girl Pearl)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh I love that girl
Love that, love that girl, love that girl, yeah
Oh I love that girl so

And I call that girl Pearl
Sweetest girl in the world

Sweetest girl in the world, love that girl Pearl
