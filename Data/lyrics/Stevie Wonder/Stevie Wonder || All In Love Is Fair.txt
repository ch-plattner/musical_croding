
All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 
But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 
But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 
But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The loosing side I'll play 
But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair
