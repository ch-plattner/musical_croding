
We're gonna have a party at the beach house
Everybody's gonna have a good time

We're gonna have a party at the beach house
Everybody's gonna have a good time

You're gonna see all of your friends
You haven't seen since school begins

We're gonna swing at the beach house
All the girls in hot black dress
Waiting for summer to get back now

We're gonna have a party at the beach house
Everybody's gonna have a good time they got to
