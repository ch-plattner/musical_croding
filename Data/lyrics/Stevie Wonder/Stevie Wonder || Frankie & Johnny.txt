
Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arm around her waist
Oh he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing a-wrong
Oh let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long 44
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor
Oh he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing a-wrong
But the last thing he told her was

Frankie, you know I love you
Why, honey why did you do that
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Frankie you know good well that I love you
Frankie I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
I'm your man and I know I was doing a-wrong
