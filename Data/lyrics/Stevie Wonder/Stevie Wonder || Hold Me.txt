
Hold me darling hold me 
And I'll always be your, be your guy 
Closer, baby come closer 
Let me be the one that loves and be by your side 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

You know I love you so 

I'll never-never let you go 
I'll never let you go 

Oh baby-baby, hold me 
Why should we be apart 

I'll never-never let you go
