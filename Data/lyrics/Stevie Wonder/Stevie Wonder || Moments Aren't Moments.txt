
Tender, warm and serene
Are the words that might come close to having
Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide
Mighty, shining and clear
Are but mere expressions that don't come near
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight

'Cause moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

Gentle, quiet, so soft
Are the wings of love that can send us off
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time
Trusting in the unknown and giving in to what feelings have shown
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives
Where we'll find

That moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

'Cause moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom
[Repeat twice]
