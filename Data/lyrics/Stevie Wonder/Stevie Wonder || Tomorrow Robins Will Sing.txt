Now every ting is lovely
So don't put yu trust inna false prophecy
Dis a de Edley Shine & Stevie
You might wonder
Stand firm to all those who feel concern
Ca when you can't see the light
You must see the Robins in flight
Life is just a matter of time or space
So all those who have to face sorrow
Shall only have to wait till tomorrow
Big tings a guan dis year
So mek we drop inna gear
Come cross missa Stevie Wonder
Watch it!

Now where do I start to make the point that I'll be making
To most efficiently use your time that I'll be taking
With the clear understanding that every ticking second is precious to us all
But if you let me bend your ear and listen up you will hear
Not just what I say, but every word that I am saying

You wake in the morning from a dream with spirits dope hype
Though you real life condition is far from being alright
Your love has wronged you, your money's gone, you've lost your home and everything you own
But before you do something major extreme
I've got one simple thing for you to take along with you, as you go on your lonely way

Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly

You borrow a dime to call up a friend that you could rely on
They put the phone down, you hear in the background "tell him I'm not home"
Your face is broken, your throat is chokin, you hang up the phone in disbelief
And to make matters worse
You can remember you were the first and only one to come to him when lonely was his everyday

But if what you did came from your heart and not expecting
Then you should not waste one heart beat on any regretting
The saying's older than old yet true for today as when it was made to be told
As you saw so shall you reap
And if you've treated life sweet
Your blessing's been ordained and already on its way

Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly

Today is the tomorrow you were so worried about
Looking over your yesterday
The clouds are gone and the sun is out
And everything has worked out irie okay

Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly
Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing
