We have time for racism
We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's 
When will there be a time to love

We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgements
When will there be a time...
When will there be a time to love

When you're weary, feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness falls
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

I will lay...
I will lay me down
