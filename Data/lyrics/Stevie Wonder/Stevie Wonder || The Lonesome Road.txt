That lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up, look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

True love, true love
What have I done
Tell me what have I done
That you should treat me so

You - caused me
Yes you caused me
To walk and talk
Like I never did before

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
