How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy

Got no time for every woman
Thinking that she's looking fine
Got no pockets full of money no no no
A fox would just be wasting her time

All I got is good good loving
And good loving doesn't have to find
Hey!

Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your baby boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy

Get it baby!
Ehhhhhhh
Mmmmmmmmhmmmm yeah

Got no need for fancy places
Got no need for cannon and wine
Got no need to move to the city no no no
Got no need to walk the line

All I need is good home cooking
And some sugar after supper time
Heeyy hey

Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your baby boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy

Ohh sugar
Ohh sugar
Ooohhhooohhhooohhh sugar
Ohh sugar
Ohh sugar ...
