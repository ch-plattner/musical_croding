What you want, baby, I got.
What you need, you know I got it.
All I askin' is for a little respect
When you come home, baby.
When you come home,
Respect.

I ain't gonna do you wrong while you gone,
I ain't gonna do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna.
All I askin' is for a little respect
When you come home, baby.
When you come home,
Respect.

I'm out to give you all my money
But all I'm askin in return, honey,
Is to give me my proper respect
When you get home, yeah baby,
When you get home.
Ooh, your kisses sweeter than honey
But guess what, so here's my money.
All I want you to do for me is give me some here
When you get home, yeah baby,
When you get home.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
Find out what it means to me.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
Hey Boy, T-C-B.
A little respect ...
