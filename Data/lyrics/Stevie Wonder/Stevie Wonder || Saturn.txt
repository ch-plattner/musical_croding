
Packing my bags-going away 
To a place where the air is clean 
On saturn 
There's no sense to sit and watch the people die 
We don't fight our wars the way you do 
We put back all the things we use 
On Saturn 
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes 

There's no principles in what you say 
No direction in the things you do 
For your world is soon to come to a close 
Through the ages all great men have taught 
Truth and happiness just can't be bought-or sold 
Tell me why are you people so cold 

I'm...... 
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow 
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow 
On Saturn 
People live to be two hundred and five 
Going back to saturn where the people smile 
Don't need cars cause we've learn to fly 
On Saturn 
Just to live to us is our natural high 

We have come here many times before 
To find your strategy to peace is war 
Killing helpless men, women and children 
That don't even know what they are dying for 
We can't trust you when you take a stand 
With a cold expression on your face 
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy 

I'm...... 
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow 
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow 
On Saturn 
People live to be two hundred and five 
Going back to saturn where the people smile 
Don't need cars cause we've learn to fly 
On Saturn 
Just to live to us is our natural high
