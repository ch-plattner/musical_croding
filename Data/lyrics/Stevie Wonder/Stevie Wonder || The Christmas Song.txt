
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and ev'ry Mother's child is gonnna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly 

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
