
Pack up your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day

The sun is shinin', come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're goin' to the Promised Land

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You'd better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles come on get happy
You'd better chase your cares away!!
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
