
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone 
To let me know you made it home 
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 

If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights 
To let you know tonight's the night 
For me and you my part-time lover 

We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers 

But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover 

We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Repeat]

I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover 

And then a man called our exchange 
But didn't want to leave his name 
I guess that two can play the game 
Of part-time lovers 
You and me, part-time lovers 
But, she and he, part-time lovers
