I don't want to bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

But now I’m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, hello, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue, I stick to other artists
I’m not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

‘Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

Does he write his own tunes? Does he write his own verse?
Hell, don’t need another word-smith to make my tune sell.
Call yourself a singer-writer. You’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe

And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
‘A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi’

‘Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

'Cause you need me, man,
You need me, man,
'Cause you need me, man,
You need me, man,

‘Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
