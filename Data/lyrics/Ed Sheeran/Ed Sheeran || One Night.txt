
Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food?
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

And we’ve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
We’re gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I don’t really dance
So I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here
I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you’re wearing

And I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone, oh.

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

She’s like the fast food
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
