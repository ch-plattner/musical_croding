
And happy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
[Acoustic version:] And you squeeze me
'Til you're not feeling sure

Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
I'll take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
if you feel too frightened
[Acoustic version:] And if you feel too frightened
I'll make things disappear, dear

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you squeeze me
[Acoustic version:] And you breathe me
'Til these thoughts leave my head

If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
[Acoustic version:] If you feel like you've been jaded and
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, mmm

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

Now, I'm missing you
[Acoustic version:] 'Cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
[Acoustic version:] And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
[Acoustic version:] And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
