This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
The sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I’m into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
The shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
