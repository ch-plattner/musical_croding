
Oh the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And I will build my love a bower 
And yon pure crystal fountain
And around it I will place
All the colors of the mountain
Would you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And If my true love's gone
I will surely find another
And to her I will sing
Things that make her know I want her

Would you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around blooming heather

Would you go, lassie, go?
