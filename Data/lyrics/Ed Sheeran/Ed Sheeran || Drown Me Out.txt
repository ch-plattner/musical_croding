
I’m in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real, 
Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out

You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out
You won’t drown me out

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out
You won’t drown me out.
