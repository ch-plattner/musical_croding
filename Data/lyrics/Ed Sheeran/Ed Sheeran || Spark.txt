
Take me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?

The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark

We’d be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That depends
Will you be my friend?

The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark
