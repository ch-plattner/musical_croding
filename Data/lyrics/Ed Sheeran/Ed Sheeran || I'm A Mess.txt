
Oh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How going through the motions
Going through us
And oh I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my own words
Are all over written on the signs
But you're on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And ohhh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words will always below
Of all the love you spoke
When you're on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long, I love, my lover
For how long I love my lover
And now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover

Now now, for how long, long I love my lover (and I feel loved)
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
I feel it all over now, now and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
