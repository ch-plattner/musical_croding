
Oh, woah
Oh, woah mmm
Oh, woah mmm

Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My my my - my my my
My my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut all of the ropes and let me fall
My my my - my my my
My my
Right in the moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
My my my - my my my
My my
Sullen load is so slow on the spit

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And now all your love is wasted
Well then who the hell was I?
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you? who will fight?
And who will fall, far behind?
Who will love you? who will fight?
And who will fall, far behind?
