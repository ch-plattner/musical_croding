
My mind is a warrior,
My heart is a foreigner,
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset.
I'll never keep it bottled up and
Left to the hands of the coroner,
Be a true heart not a follower,
We're not done yet now.

I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
And I'll never let you down,
So we'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down.

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down.

My eyes are a river filler,
This drink is a liver killer,
Your chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again.

Now I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
And I'll never let you down,
So we'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down,

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down.
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down.

So hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down [x3]

Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Now, now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down.
