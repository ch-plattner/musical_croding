I'm just a bachelor, lookin' for a partner
And someone who knows how to ride without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible and takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off, I promise that you won't wanna get off

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it

I'm sittin' here flossin', peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance, the things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
I send shivers up and down your spine, and fluids flowin' down your thigh

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it

Wanna get freaky baby
And feel you next to me
And you can join my jockey team (yeah)

Wanna get nasty baby
And feel you next to me (yeah)
And you can join my jockey team (wooh yeah)

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
