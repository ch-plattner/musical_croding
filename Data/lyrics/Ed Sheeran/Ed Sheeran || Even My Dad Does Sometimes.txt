
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
Cause deaths the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that deaths the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on
So live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on

Live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on
