
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor's in me baby
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded, faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love
I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

There we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything's all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy I'm drinking
Brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out
He sweat it out, I wear that
Boy I'm drinking
I'm on the mic till my voice horse
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then I ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, grain, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that
Swerve swerving on that big body
Just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Dunk in love

Now we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I don't know much about love but I know I've been shot by you
And I don't know much about algebra but I know one plus one is two
Cause we ain't got nothing but love
Babe you got enough for both of us

Cause we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
