[Ed:]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
"'Cause real will recognise real" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

[Devlin:]
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

[Ed:]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

[Devlin:]
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]
The times I'm living in lately.
