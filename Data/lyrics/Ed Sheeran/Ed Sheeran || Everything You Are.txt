
I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight

I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same, again and again and again
I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

Oh I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

When I see my future
It is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you
We'll get there

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want
Behind my truth lies everything you want
Behind my truth lies everything you are
