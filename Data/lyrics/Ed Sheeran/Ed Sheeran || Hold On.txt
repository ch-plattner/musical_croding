[Verse 1:]
It's alright to cry,
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes,
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die,
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

[Chorus:]
So live life like you're giving up,
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

[Verse 2:]
It's alright to shake,
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage,
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say,
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on

[Chorus 2x:]
So live life like you're giving up,
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on
