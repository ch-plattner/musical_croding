I'm getting older now
23 years old and half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other half's like, "Hell no, you better mess around
Don't let me down, especially when you got an album coming out"
When I first saw you
I'm like, aw shit goddamn it look what God did
Hail Mary Jesus
Three years later I'm sitting in our apartment
Thinking about all the places that my heart's been
I mean it's crazy right, this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought, pulled me out, and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south
Which leads to crazy fights
And I don't know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love
Wanna continue what
But
This ain't the same old love song
Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
What
You know what makes it worth it
To watch someone progress, to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry too
It's something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself, and that you're always learning
To acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person, but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary, but it's so complex
It's the most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it could work, I'm attempted, nah, we're living it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that, come on

Every time I can't ignore you
Every time I come around I see your face always moving

Just working on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world, you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does, it doesn't work we both know that it was meant to breathe
Can't hide from experiences
And there's so many people out there in this world we're gonna find interesting
It's only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away, what you expect?
You see I'm wondering where are you
Tearing the label off of a beer as I'm sitting at this bar stool
You would tell me not to call you
To never use you as a fall through
To sit with my emotion
But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you, you know
Lets get em, come on

We been together but in my head
We would break apart
I would hold my heart, tied inside
But you knew that my soul could not be given to anybody easily
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

It's a beautiful thing isn't it
One more time Ev

Every time I can't ignore you
Feels good don't it
Every time I come around I see your face always moving
