[Hook:]
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play

[Verse 1: Pearl Dragon]
My body is adorned with thorns
King with a crown of thorns
I wash my feet and kiss the ground I'm on
I wash my feet kiss the ground I'm on, I'm on
Jump niggas cause they thought I was a pawn
But knowin' I'm a king I'm about to get on
This the sirens for the quiet of the storm
Ring that alarm, R-r-ring that alarm
Yo her body was adorn adorned,
And I adored her, so much that I had to ignore her
Her body I explored it, like an explor-her
Her first name was Dora, her first name was Dora
I opened up the door and saw
My queen getting raw, getting raw
So like me beatin Resevoir Dog
Had to hit it raw, no not raw dog
I was a, hog, but I don't eat the pork
She was a swine, crippling' my time
On the cast of my pearl, yo she wasn't my girl
This wasn't reality, this wasn't my world
Like Jimi or Kurt before
King with a crown I shall be adored
Even if I have, always been ignored
I was not the norm I will not be ignored

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Thomas Gray]
Young world this the story of the kings
A nigga couldn't decide should I rap or should I sing
And since God blessed me with my wings
I'm like a lil' nappy-head Bill Russell with the rings, feel me?
Lately globetrottin' through a lotta traps
Friends become rats, I'm talkin Judas in expensive slacks
Fuck em, to tell the truth now I'm over that
Sucker 'I'll be suckers, it don't matter that you roll with pack
I steady grab my nuts and you can roll with that
Pardon my back, and the weight on my shoulders black
History's on my side, these niggas hard in they cars
But in the streets they can't look me in the eye
(Look me in the eye, look me in the eye)
(Champagne Champagne)

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
(Can I get em?)
Stand like a man, move like a legend
Talk but with action, that's how you'll be remembered
The greats learned that humility is a weapon
Sever ties with the part of you too big to learn a lesson
Sit in silence, to fight the mind and try to find the present
Cause we only get a couple chances to be epic
And I'm connected, like God plugged my headphones
Directly into heaven and told me to go and get em with this
Mic cord, I am, nothing you can tell me
They bark when they talk but they walk like the legless
The purpose of my art, is for people to respect me
I'm not a king I'm a servant to the desires that tempt me
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Be a mirror to the people when they're searchin for truth
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Claim the mirror, my people, keep searchin for you

[Hook]
