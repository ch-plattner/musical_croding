[Verse 1 — Macklemore:]
Round here they sing broken hymns
Their prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By a bartender that'll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that'll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There's a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don't cover it up
Rusted faces, familiar places
Even if they haven't left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that's so strong I'd be a fool not to chase it
But yet, I'm a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I'll be right back

[Hook — Allen Stone:]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I've misplaced that sense of fright
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
Listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been that thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Verse 2 — Macklemore:]
I read the Bible, but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the church is
Pured by their imperfections, everything that's burning
To Hell with the confessions, all the "Lord Have Mercy's"
Blessed in holy water, the sin, Oh Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch vodka?
11 AM in the morning and you can't get it off ya
Callin' to the preacher but it's like the pastor isn't talking
Until the store opens I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say that I'm in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, that's according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you're judgin' I don't want it
I got sins that scold like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I'm sinking and that's why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, far more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I'm getting amnesia
Shaking 'til I get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

[Bridge — Macklemore:]
Wouldn't miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral

[Bridge — Macklemore:]
Wouldn't miss it for the world
Baptized my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, Neon Cathedral
Neon Cathedral

[Hook — Allen Stone:]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I've misplaced that sense of fright
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
Listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been that thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

Dependency has been that thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been that thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
