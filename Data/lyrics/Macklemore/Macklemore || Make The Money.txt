[Verse 1]
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Verse 2]
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, necklace
What I really need is a job off CraigsList
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, Twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Of course I want dubs and a candy painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track

[Hook]

Forget about the fame
I said forget about the fame
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true
