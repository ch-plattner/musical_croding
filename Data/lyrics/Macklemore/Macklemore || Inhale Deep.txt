
We all know life can get hectic
But if you live in the second,
You exist in the present
And that's how you stay connected
Go through good times and hardships
And if you learn to accept it
And know that every struggle in life,
Is there to teach you a lesson
It's times like this that make you
It's always the darkest part of the night, right before the sun has it's break through
The spirits there to knock you down,
But if you make that the end
You will never know the beauty
Of being able to stand up again
And face it, with patience,
The Pace set is dealing
With judgements and hatred,
Depressed hopeless feelings
But I've been told,
You only create your own ceilings
Life is limitless,
And knowing this is what the spirit is

That's why I try to inhale deep, so I can find peace, and essence can find me
That's why I lose myself in these beats,
Let myself become one with the drum and set myself free

Whatever direction life leads me,
There is a purpose behind it
That's the way it was supposed to be
And any time you can turn over a new leaf
Y'all know the truth,
It's up to us to use the key
Been three years since my first album dropped
It's been fear that's really got me stuck on the spot
Not wanting to put out anything whack
So inside of putting licks on my tracks,
I put my lips to a sack
Because it's easier to spend your life drunk,
And high on drugs
Than to put everything on recording,
And put it out to be judged
We look for the audience,
To put their hands up and show love
But when they put their hands down,
Our confidence really takes the plunge
So instead of making music
That people might not like,
I went into isolation
I traded my mic in for the pipe
Started living the college life,
Drinking and smoking every day
Rationalizing to myself,
That I was going through a phase
Then I stopped,
Thinking my music would take it's place
But when you live in fog,
Inspiration is hard to create
It takes more to get connected,
Than to quit smoking every day
And when I get frustrated I get a Swisher
And get blown away
Then all of a sudden it hit me,
These kids are listening
If I'm not making music,
Then why the fuck am I existing
How can I talk about the problems,
Of some one else
When I don't have the motivation,
And confidence to change myself
It's been so long since I really truly felt
What it's like to live without substances to help
Massive struggle that's natural to one's health
With addiction in my blood,
I play the cards I was dealt
The wind is the most calm,
Right before the storm
And when you least expect it,
It doesn't rain, it pours
I swear to God you can never be warned
Because with or without that umbrella
Nature is still gonna take it's course

That's why I try to inhale deep,
So I can find peace, and essence just finds me,
That's why I lose myself in these beats,
Put away the weed, And turn to my MPC

C'mon'
If I could just, I would change
If I could just, I would change
If I could just, I would change
If I could just, I would change
