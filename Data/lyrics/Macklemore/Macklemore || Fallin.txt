I swear I've been here before, there's a war in my heart,
Inside my chest is a thorn it's been torn from the start,
The picture painted is warped, the hearts aching and scarred,
Music's the band-aid I'm too afraid to take this shit off
Another drink at the bar but I'm not drunk enough,
Each shot burns less but the chest isn't numbin up,
A voice keeps talkin' in my head and I'm a fuck him up,
Fill the gun with lead and bust until the pump shuts him up,
Emos and rockers and rockers and emos another shot of some vodka to get myself up off of my ego,
There's a door to my conscious, I can't unlock it or see the peephole,
This angel held my baggage and then vanished like where did she go,
I was beside her but I was walking by myself though,
Break the silence with my cell phone it doesn't help though,
I can't believe this is happening, sinking into depression,
I've been here before and now I'm back again

I keep fallin, I keep fallin, I keep fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don't know if I can get up today
Keep fallin, I keep fallin, fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don't know if I can get up today

6am hung over leaving my booty call watch the sunrise
Head over I-5 headed North but there's no sign of sunshine,
Empty brandy bottles spilled on the forgotten memories
Know I gotta let it go I'm just to selfish to set it free
Like forced release, two hours later I just got up and bounced
If she could only see me now head lost swallowed and drowned
The path is up but I followed it down
A man gone and hollowed out because you opened it up,
You can't start over now
What's to keep going for? validated by drunken whores bloody knuckles so numb and sore from punching these rusty doors
Freeway signs underpasses man stranded dusty mattress
This world is bipolar, beautiful for some for others the fuckin' saddest...
So sick of lugging baggage
All I got is drugs and alcohol and these cuts of passion
Brain serenade razor blade punk madness
Pain is love plug the drain but the rain keeps crashing like

I keep fallin, I keep fallin, I keep fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don't know if I can get up today
Keep fallin, I keep fallin, fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don't know if I can get up today
