I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive.
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by-
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize.

A friend of mine once told me,
We have many paths in this journey.
They act in different directions
So when you question don't be worried,
It's not a wrong one-
Beauty can be found in all of them.

You'll meet people whose paths intersect
But you don't know how long you'll walk with them,
Cause' the truth is, and it's so hard, but you'll never know
How long we'll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road.
The path veers and it's clear that we must steer alone.
I've learned if you can't hold on to that moment that exists-
Let it go.

Cause' freedom is god.
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on
And possessing the strength to take it off.
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when it's hard having faith in the ability to embrace that
That's where you are,
And this is it.
The same shit that we work towards,
But go against in the same sense.

My friend hit me to some game and truth unravelled, she said
"The brighter the light, the darker the shadow",
And since I'm on cliche terms, knowing is half the battle.
But I don't know,
So I just go with what was destined.
Life can be a burden or a blessing,
The choice is yours to be connected.
It's there if you want it, you got it, now let it.

Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky.
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive.
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by-
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize.

I feel like I have nothing to give right now,
This is my trial, tribulations, and it must go down,
But where's the up?
I'm stuck with the broken smile,
No jokin' now, wantin' to grab a swish and smoke this out.
The moment of a man choosing what path I will go down
Do I give in, give up, or get up and live right now?
With a split gut, pick myself up and spit my style,
This is the only thing that can holds my ground.
You're born into this world alone and alone you'll go out
All I have is myself and everyone else I doubt.
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside the chest that beats with the breath of the now.
No sunshine when she's gone, I can only see clouds.
No homies can hold me down, the spirit's testing me now
But I can withstand this world, but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions, it's like I'm being held down to drown.
Hell's right around the corner, but I can turn it around.
You always have a choice, no matter the situation, you're not bound,
To nothing, no one. You're chosen for this job,
This is your life, you can't escape this bitch when it's hard.
Just know that it passes, but you'll collect scars-
They never go away, but they will make you who you are.
This is a beautiful struggle, I share it in song cause'
I can't control this, remember: the moment's beyond us.

Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky.
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive.
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by-
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize.
