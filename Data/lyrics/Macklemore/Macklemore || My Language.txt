This is my language [x17]

[Intro: Macklemore]
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
The risk of blunderin' to rap in front of a couple a hundred kids knowin' my licks is humblin'
Spit the struggle of an addict to puff in them swisher split but the light that was lit, I quickly run from it
I turn away from that source inside
A slicker for happiness, thinkin' I need a store to buy it
Recordin's priceless but look at how important ice is
I thought rhyming was forever now it's imported diamonds
My point is eyein', music that's absorbed my life an'
You glorify guns, they bust sex and drugs of course they'll try it
And I can't even front like I didn't, cause I still do and that's why I'm spittin'
I'm lookin' for this thing called moderation that I heard some found
The only problem with drugs is sometime you gotta come down
I lived half my life numb and bud drowned
And rum, vodka, how many bucks have I spent on dubs now?
I'm 23, look at my lungs now
The amount of THC from the swish of sweet blunt count?
I can't even conceive, that's why I run wild
In these streets like I was 13, like fuck now
I make that revolution music, but not for the army
A reminder against the vices that harm me
Cause I could never see how affected my lung is
You only get one shot at life, no ad-libs or punch ins

[Hook 2: Many Voices]
This is my language [x13]

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, my mom once told me that we're not finished products, only
Authors of a book, and the object is to write it slowly
This is my last 16, I'll go for it
Four years in college and this is all I have to show for it
I said, this is my last song, so here's my passion
18 tracks, each one an attempt to take my mask off
Woo! The oral tradition's been passed on
While she ride the rhythm to the points that I'm a blast off
And as the music absorbs through
Me to be like Don P. hearin' beats from my dorm room
XP, It's been a joy and blessin'
My boy 'til my death and my Step-Cousin with voice from heaven
Yes, Budo! It was you who produced through
I am connected and now our friendship is the truth, dude
My last two are for NuNu of course
I dedicate it to you, but this album's already yours

[Hook 3: Many Voices]
This is my language [x16]
(I wanna be an elk) [x2]

[Outro: Macklemore]
I'm proud to say this is my language
I'm out
That's it
The Language of My World
(This is my Language)
It's been a long journey, and a struggle indeed, and I'm so glad that it's over
Thank you for listening
Until next time, peace and blessings
This is my language
