How y'all doing there, folks?
My name is Aberdeen Washington
And I'm a proud American and a terrorist fighter
That's right
Hey get me another beer bitch

Now when the day Bin Laden comes to town
I'm a drop a deuce wipe it up with his towel
Mow my lawn, sit on the couch, I'm a watch some football
I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell out of those damn Redskins
Call up the boys, get drunk as shit
Goddamn right, I'm American
That's right, I'm American

Got a picture of Reagan above my fire
Next to the deer I shot with my rifle
N.R.A.? Hell yeah, I support 'em
No pro-choice, no abortion
Mexicans? send 'em back over the border
Right on home to Samoa, wherever they come from
Taking our jobs, eating out hamburgers, taking our jobs
They're taking our jobs, I see 'em in the fields I'm taking their heads off
I hate my job and I hate my boss
But I love my country and I pray to God that the cowboys win
FUCK YEAH ROMO
That the Cowboys win

That's right, that's right, that's right, come on
Everybody just clap your hands
If you love our country, if you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist and you eat sand, sandwiches

The day Bin Laden comes to town
I'm a drop a deuce wipe my poop with his towel
Mow my lawn, sit on the couch, and I'm a watch some football
And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell out of those damn Redskins
Call up the boys, get drunk as shit
Goddamn right, I'm American
I'm Ameri-fuckin'-can

Now John McCain and Sarah Palin I know you lost out there and it was a tough one
But you're still two mavericks in my book, don't worry about it
Now listen Palin, I heard you like beer
Me too and I don't have a six pack, but I got a beer bong in my pants
What do you say we go get shitfaced in a helicopter and kill a moose
America, the chosen
Guns, explosions
McDonalds, bowling
You don't like it, we exploit ya
Pop a pill, get a boner
Hell Yeah Tony Romo
Man that guy's so damn cute I want to sack his boner and ride him brokeback all the way to Wyoming
... No homo... syke

Hey I said no homo
Hey... fuck terrorists
I don't mean like f-, I don't want to fuck a terrorist
Guys I'm kidding
I like Romo, I don't like Bromo
I said fuck terrorists not I want to fuck a terrorist
You wouldn't, if you caught Bin Laden you wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If ya said "no homo" right after ya did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists
Hey little Aberdeen, come in here

Yeah

Hey come sing the family national anthem, come on
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Hey, Hey
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Hey, Hey

That's right, I'm an American citizen
Aberdeen Washington, this is my country
And just because Barack Obama won the presidential election
Does not mean that half the country doesn't feel the same way I do

And I came to America
And I live in America
Come on
And I live in America

I do too, dad
Let me get 'em

And I live in America
And I live in Ameri...

Shut up, little Aberdeen shut the fuck up

My bad

Let me tell 'em
That's right
I'm American
