
I don't know why
But it's like I can't stay quiet
This is my voice
I can't let it die inside me
See I'll be scared if there wasn't a riot
Pushin and pullin, grabbin some hair,
Pukin and fuckin up the sidewalk
This battle makes it interestin
I abide desires
Like a dog pissin on the hydrant
Just to spite the fire
It's not to be taken lightly
The page is a set of eyelids
The booth is an instrument that God created
To record us tryin to find him
But don't let the word throw you off
Religion and spirit are two different pilots
Just know that it's bigger than me and my ego
When I'm flyin
Take me higher
I've got somethin to pray for
Please leave me when I'm guided
Who said that life is cinema
This is epic, be present

I'm right here
Selfish, selfish, selfish me, yeah, me
Yeah, girlfriend, break-up, new one, one-night stand, cheat, cheat, repeat that
Drug use, clean up, drug use, drug use, clean up, drug use, rehab
Fuck you I suck dude, self-loathing, self-esteem, ego, then me again
Put a soundcheck right in the middle
A never ending quest to try and get fans
There you have a beginning, a middle and a really shitty end
Nah, give me a break through, can I get a montage, come on I need that
Humble me, give me a conflict, a hardship, let me break through this cement
They're gonna be so disappointed when they roll the credits in
I realized that my movie sucked and I was the only one that could edit it
Well the course, the chain of events, that would be the evidence, some say it's coincidence
I say I found something greater than myself and started accepting it
And I can see, feel, taste and smell again
And I'm the only one with the hammer to break this shell I'm in
It's gonna take me crackin' this mirror to finally be myself again
Met my potential a long time ago and I'm not stopping til I resemble him

(I got soul but I'm not a soldier...)
