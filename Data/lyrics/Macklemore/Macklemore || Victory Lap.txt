[Intro:]
And they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know you got a whole world to change
But understand who you got to change first"

[Verse 1:]
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty just hoping that I could find a bum to buy a 40 for me
And have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Gimme a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sipping on some lean I would let loose
Looking in the mirror, watching myself lose
Cleaned up in '08, got a job making barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with RL, performing in front of 8 people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
8 People turn into sold out shows in a minute
And I'm watching my pops in the back row grinning
With his glass up to my mom, toasting his Guinness

[Hook:]
And we on (we on)
Good music, get lost in the ambiance
When day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)

[Verse 2:]
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yah, nah, I won't win it yet
I probably won't get it, but I'm gonna give it everything
Play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every God damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
2 women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control and my souls mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city
Seattle that raised me
Rule 4080, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

[Hook:]
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)

[Outro:]
Oh my God, feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

And they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know you got a whole world to change
But understand who you got to change first"

Put 'em up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up

Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, Seattle

Put 'em up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up (so high)
