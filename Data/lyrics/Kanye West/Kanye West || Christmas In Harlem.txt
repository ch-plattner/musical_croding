[Teyana Taylor - Chorus]
Christmas in Harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall
even though we ain't balling
feels like we bought it all
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Kanye West - Verse 1]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
huh, now we all living the good life
yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
and we wiping snow up off the windshield
it's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
and I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
and we a lil late with the Christmas gifts
rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
the streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
my only question is, "Where my presents?"
she said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
well, I like the way you think, mami
now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es
gave her the hot chocolate, she said "It's D-ricious"

[Teyana Taylor - Chorus]
Christmas in Harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa, though)
even though we ain't balling (You might have to sit on my lap)
feels like we bought it all (Ho, ho, ho)
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Cyhi the Prince]
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all
for Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off
ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe
I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole
her voice slow 'cause "I always got a sore throat"
okay, stop it, no more jokes
you never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close
and my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
ha, I got nine reindeers
that's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'
that's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen
that's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen
happy kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian
everybody gets gifts as long as I'm living
so look forward to having

[Teyana Taylor - Chorus]
