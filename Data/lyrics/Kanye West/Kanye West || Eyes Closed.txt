[Chorus]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Kanye West - Verse 1]
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
its Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again
till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Chorus]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Kanye West - Verse 2]
I sold my soul to the devil,
I know its a crappy deal,
at least it came with a few toys,
like a Happy Meal,
I’m spaced out dog,
I be on that moontalk,
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle,
lets exchange Angels
photoshoot at my crib,
lets exchange angles
rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles,
I’m so anxious I’m gettin anxiety
begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me,
they say I’ve been an asshole,
I said if you acquire me,
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
with a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off,
I’m Paranoid Like bonin’ Raw dog
and wakin up with a slight cough
yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft
plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
never meant to hurt you, I should’ve had nights off
but it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

[Chorus]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
