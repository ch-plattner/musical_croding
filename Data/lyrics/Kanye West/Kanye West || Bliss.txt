[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jetset away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ohh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you's all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I remember when the pilot closed the door
Said it's time for lift off
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
But don't ever wonder
Cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top
You'll never question why you left
Oh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

[Hook: John Legend & Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss
