[Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see ya face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see ya dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail
In this give or take World I got what it takes
Put you out your misery, Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm cash money
If we could buy time, I spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in a blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine

(All of the lights)

Bright lights, night lights, head lights
Shh, no lights but the infra-red lights
Yeah, long life, don't like to ask twice
You killin' me baby, this the past life

[Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here baby
extra bright, I want y'all to see this
turn up the lights in here, baby
you know what I need
want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Big Sean]
Ready, set, now, go go, go go go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
Westside bitch, quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there hoe,
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me but I can't read Morse code
Why every rapper name BIG got body huh?
But every rapper named Sean got money, ooooooh
Well I guess my chances are fifty fifty
But my vision is twenty twenty so I'll be counting a hundred hundreds
(All of the lights)
Oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick now you want beef
and I'm just chuckling like a porky cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
That's a one way ticket to hell and they want these bullets to book it for me
Man, I'm shittin' on every statistic that said I'll be dead or fucking broke
This is History, your kids, kids, kids, kids gon book report me but, what
And I think they wanna murder me
I'm shining hard cause bitch I'm at Emergency
B-I, GOOD G, I dooo it, boi

[Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights

[Alicia Keys]
Whoaa-oh-whoa
Whoaa-oh-whoa-oh

[Elton John]
I tried to tell you but all I could say is ohhhh

[Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions
Man, I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just left out of the strip club
Made 5 thousand look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston smoke that Kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, don't do Lindsay
I made 2 million since last Wednesday and I hate y'all
Ya'll got too much free time
Sayin' I ain't dropped shit
Everything'll be fine
Worrying 'bout your old girl,
Tryna see if she's mine
nigga she's with me, when she tells you she needs some "me" time
Its our time so fuck y'all
I really bout to go Spring break now, start taking shots in this muthafucker
And ya didn't really have all that ass, last month, girl you got some shots in that muthafucker
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucker and you thought niggas was gonna pop in this muthafucker
Uh, Young Money, Power Respect in this bitch, you would think we got the Lox in this muthafucker
I made mistakes, I made some bread, I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV, it wont be long 'til they could see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that
All in a Sprite, all in a Sprite

[Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
gotta let these niggas know, yeah
get it right, ay
you should go and get your own

[Outro]
