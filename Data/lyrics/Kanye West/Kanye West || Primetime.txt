[Jay-Z:]
We in the time of our lives baby
Turn the music up, primetime

Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon
That’s what the fuck we on
Mo’ money, 40 year old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23’s they can’t fuck with the boy
As far as them 16’s, I’m 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88’, got warm in 92’, I landed in 96’
That’s the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff’s stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I’m headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do (ooh)

[Kanye West:]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
Cause they don’t want nobody that’s colored out of the lines
So I’m late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Niggas gon’ kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I’m too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it’s like, it’s like our first 1st class flight
I’m trippin’ on it, socks on marble floors
I’m slippin’ on it, champagne, I’m sippin’ on it
Shit taste different, don’t it?
You know what, you right
It’s like the best damn champagne I had in my life
“When you coming home” That’s a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
I mean who says shit like that, and doesn’t laugh (un-huh)

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
