Now beat that
And your mothers sayin “go to college”
So u finish college and its wonderful
U feel so good
And after all the partying and crazing
And don’t forget about that drug habit u picked up at school bein around your peers
Hey now you’ll get that  25 thou, job a year and  
You’ll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it’ll be you’re your money
No more borrowin money from mom for my high
So now you get ur degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it
If u continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!
You’ll come in at an entry level position and when u do that
If u kiss enough ass, you’ll move up to the next level
Which is being a secretary’s secretary!
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary 
Who never went to college
Shes actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart man
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, 
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes
No I’ve never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks to me says “hey u know whats sexy?”
I say “no, I don’t know what it is, but I bet I can add up all the change in your purse very fast”.
