[Verse 1]
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen 
Straight up out a movie scene 
Who knew she was a drama queen 
That a turn my life to Stephen King 
Up late night like she on patrol 
Checking everything like I'm on parole 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now 
Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it 

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop 
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop 
Now I don't need no Robocop 

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history 
You like the girl from Misery 
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree 
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on 
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You never stop it now 
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it 

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop 
You moving like a Robocop 
When did you become a Robocop 
Somebody please make her stop 

[Verse 3]
Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I 
Ain't used to being told stop 
So I could never be your robot 
Fast or slow you can stay or can go 
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know 
Yea I had her before but that happened before 
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more 
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh 
It ain't ok, ok, ok

[Outro]
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just and LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Ha ha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now
