[Pharrell:]
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
the muthafucking skateboard P
knowing that your mee lo
playing games like you’re cee-lo
in a tight situation like speedo’s
you can have it your way like Carlito
my nigga will be happy to give you torpedos
and have you car twisted like a blunt
for you faggot ass niggas that like to front
I’m on some BBC bape shit
I'm on some cake shit
in the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron
you hating and you want to erase it
close your eyes when you know you can’t take it
my flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis
you talk street shit it sound like sweet shit
straight liquorice you niggas sound ticklish
80k large for the Hermes dream
coke n crop in all your magazines
hunger strike yourself, look like Celine
Dion, me and my niggas like freon
you bitches on my pecan
she got an ass you can eat on
try to play tough like the leather on a Vuiton
I hit it til I could seat on
try to get her freak on
ask me to R Kelly ya and get pee’d on
I said it ain't me maam
that 8 behind me still got the burner
yes the enzo is stilll black like Sojourner
truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth
spittin’ what I did in the booth
I’m out, pooof!

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era
wanna bear n tell the truth, I dare ya
ya lie, so eat these whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers
for terror made in america too live
fuck the property or give me my props properly
high off life this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology
my policy’s not to be dishonestly deprived
so gimme that, gimme that, keep going
where my city at, I’m like steak and fries but never die
they wanna Ghostface wanna be me
but they will post haste follow me into the after life
that means you going right after I’ve
but I’m the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow
so someway somehow I have survived
ha ha surprised
who is he that we see coming over the tides
in a speed boat, boat load of pride
Fall of Rome, dress shirted and mastermind tie
he what happens when rappping and happen the fashion collide
so OMG is the "C" from the C-R-S LOL’ing at you haters
tell your BFF’s like

[Kanye West:]
Yes, Mr West turn that new child rebel
loud as a badass child level
who need a chorus we through with a tyrannosaurus
tyrone it’s been a year with no phone
could you explain how high is your zone
we’ll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine
there’s hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame
and for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
make ‘em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, business manager’s Jewish
and if I get sued my lawyers Jews
some girls do, grab the cojones
say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us
brand new ferrari’s I gotta make the donuts
C-R-S is like a hip hop Christmas bonus
niggas is hating on the internet I couldn’t tell
I was too busy rapping GOOD as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail!
tell collect to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinci, gettin’ Benji’s, get half off Fendi
half of that’s to Cindy’s
hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy
popped too many corks to let you dork’s offend me
props in New York but Chi town’s the city
get my city hoochie’s Gucci, Monica Bellucci’s
are those the real millionnaires or the bendi’s?
I’m so ultra I’m even over Oprah
but let me check your account, haha no sir

Don’t stop, don't stop...
