[Raheem Devaughn]
Turn up ya radio now I suggest
It's the remix and we the best
Raheem DeVaughn and Kanye West

Man, hold your head high 
Cause it's the test
And what don't kill you
Make you stronger, my brotha
So when you feelin' down, my brotha
And getta mournin' the lost of your mother
Heaven's got a brand-new angel shining down like bright lights...

(Flashing lights, lights)
B.C.I. to Chi Town
(Flashing lights, lights)
See my name like the Hollywood sign
(Flashing lights, lights)
And you can hate it, but I'm still gon shine
(Flashing lights, lights)
I'm still gon shine
(Flashing lights, lights)
Yeah, I'm still gon shine
Yeah, still gon shine

[Raheem Devaughn]
My name's been spreadin' lik a rumor
In the hood, I'm buzzin' like a tumor
G-Girl, you ain't gettin' no paper
I know that you're a star-chaser.

You hooked, You want, You love the...
(Flashing lights, lights)
Maybe it's the way I entertain
Maybe it's the way I shine like...
(Flashing lights, lights)
But you thrist, you crave, you yearn the
flashing light

And now you drunk 
Cause you can't hold yo liquor
Talkin' bout you came in the club wit yo n*&&a
Askin' can you leave wit me, Go figure!
But I would rather leave wit Alicia Keys

Southern paparizzi, NO...
(Flashing lights, lights)
No pictures, No videos
That be a good look scenrio
(Flashing lights, lights)
They caught me on the red carpet though

[Raheem Devaughn]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

[Kanye West]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
A-bay-bay, late-ly you been all on my brain

And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult

Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum,
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

[Raheem Devaughn]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)

I'm in the speakers shinin' like...
I'm on stage shinin' like...
I'm in the club shinin' like...
I'm in the hood shinin' like... 
(Flashing lights, lights)

So put your shades on right
(Flashing lights, lights)
Cause I'm shinin' bright, like flashing...
(Lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights...fading)
LIGHTS!
I'm shinin'...Ohhh, Ohhh...
[Fade out]
