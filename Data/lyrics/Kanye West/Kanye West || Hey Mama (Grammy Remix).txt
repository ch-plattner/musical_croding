Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
My M-m-m-m Mama

I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz I’m So Proud Of You An A
Let Me Tell You What I’m About To Do
Mama, You Know I Act A Fool But, I Promise You I’m Goin Back To School An
I Appreciate What You Allowed For Me, An A

I Was Three Years Old, When You And I Moved To The Chi
Late December, Harsh Winter Gave Me A Cold
You Fixed Me Up Something That Was Good For My Soul
Famous Homemade Chicken Soup, Can I Have Another Bowl?
You Work Late Nights Just To Keep On The Lights
Mommy Got Me Training Wheels So I Could Keep On My Bike
And You Would Give Anything In This World
Michael Jackson Leather And A Glove, But Didn’t Give Me A Curl
And You Never Put No Man Over Me
And I Love You For That Mommy Cant You See?
Seven Years Old, Caught You With Tears In Your Eyes

Cuz Somebody Cheatin, Telling You Lies, Then I Started To Cry
As We Knelt On The Kitchen Floor
I Said Mommy Imma Love You Till You Don’t Hurt No More
And When I’m Older, You Ain't Gotta Work No More
And Imma Get You That Mansion That We Couldn’t Afford
See You’re, Unbreakable, Unmistakable
Highly Capable, Lady That’s Makin Loot
A Livin Legend Too, Just Look At What Heaven Do
Send Us An Angel, And I Thank You

Mama, I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz I’m So Proud Of You An A
Let Me Tell You What I’m About To Do
Mama, You Know I Love You So An,
I Never Let You Go An I Wrote This Song Just So You Know No Matter When You Go

Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.

This Life, Is All A Dream, An My Real Life Starts When I Go To Sleep.
My M-m-m-m Mama
