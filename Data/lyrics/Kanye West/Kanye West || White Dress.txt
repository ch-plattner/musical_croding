[Hook]
Just me and you girl
(Wooooah oooh)
Just me and you girl
(Wooooah oooh)

Tryna sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren’t you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no makeup
I’m just tryna be inside you ‘fore you wake up

[Hook]
Just me and you girl
(Wooooah oooh)
Just me and you girl
(Wooooah oooh)

We have problems but thats all in the past
Everybody got problems baby I got a past
Remember I used to do things that would make you laugh
Like ordering girl drinks in a masculine glass
You like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain’t no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking
Your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching
You’re pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we’re kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like ‘no he didn’t?’
No he didn’t, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Tryna to get a pair of Christian’s?
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say how it’s work baby
Well some of the models is too coked to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
It kept me on the phone and demanded they always
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
Now my credit so bad I can’t get no one to co-sign
I woulda thought she woulda busted a dope crime
But she up and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it’s a miracle that she’a talk to a nigga
with a ten year ago swag
Plus I don’t like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin’ at niggas is watever
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can’t bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try and come talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candle light dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I can picture you in a white dress
30 foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides I’m so glad you came
Auntie couldn’t make it, oh no, thats a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasn’t excited
Well we’ll go to the country side and they won’t be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting
Tell peaches light the herb, we just re-united, we just re-united
Lets make a move on these herds, go somewhere private
I’m talking just me and you and a plane and a pilot
