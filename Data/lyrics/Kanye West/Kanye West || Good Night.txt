[Bridge - Mos Def] 
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Verse - Kanye West] 
Right now I can see it so vivid 
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
People you never got a chance to say bye to 
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams 
Into real life, if you try to 
So close, but so far 
And so far, no cigar 
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today 
So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow 
No goodbye 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Verse - Al Be] 
Uhh, to you 
If I part my heart will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
My art will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Bridge - Mos Def x3]
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true
