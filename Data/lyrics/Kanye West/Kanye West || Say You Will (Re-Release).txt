Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
(I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song, this song could play and could come true
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true
I wish this song)
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
(I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(I admit I, I admit I)
Don't say you will, you will, you will
(Say you will, say you will
Don't say I, don't say I)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
