[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand dollar jeans
Your girl a Queen, my girl a thing
You know what though? I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team

[Kanye West:]
I'm a take this one for the team
GOOD music
Yeah you know what
I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like shit
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water that shit probably worse
Is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Ooooh, that shit gotta hurt

[Chorus: Pusha T]

[Pusha T:]
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass
And my bitch got on tights with a tac ass
I'm a fly nigga and I carry on
With the bottles of that Rose and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carry's on
Dookie chain and a herringbone
Real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights baby that's a field trip
Double date don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

[Chorus]

[Kanye West:]
Ladies and gentleman
It's G.O.O.D music in the house
And we got Keri

[Keri Hilson:]
All I know you the one that I heard about
Know you work your way up through word of mouth
Plus I'm a have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

(I like your mentality baby)

[Cyhi The Prynce:]
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar
I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car
She a red bone but her cousin is dark
A little out of shape but you'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying fuck, she talking she wanna eat first
I'm like why did this bitch have to bring her
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer
On a scale of 1-10 she's a 15â€²er
Meaner, shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
Though on my team she will be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one and the beamer
I'm the point guard and I need wing...

[Keri Hilson:]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

[Chorus]

[Kanye West:]

But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date

We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out

And I bet I'm gon sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
