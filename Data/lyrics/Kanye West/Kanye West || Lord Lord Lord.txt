This is something special
This is something new
This is something special
This is something new

[Mos Def]
The power of observation
marvells and frights, its strange delights
attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
ecstatic patterns in the calender design
wilderness tours guided by and for the blind
cool rulers standing still sweating through the shade
who knew those lights only grew bright to fame
dead wrong pageantry lottery and games
slight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
the carnival till bell will hustle for the age
they clutch what they covet but what must they give away
who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay
surprise it's your life its your business anyway so please
pardonly and such curious minds
peace safe passage, precious time
hither and gone, the day of days
(?) this tiny stone illuminated by a star far gone
only star so large, many more
to make our largest star show small
furthermore the end is not the end no stop but I'm pausing
what we can witness is all that isn't all
(?) scotch and pork chops
the passion, expansion the order of the random
see the dreamers see the sleepers
(?) sweet jesus and life on Earth
seek heaven first
let put in this work

Her heels set the mood
where did you acquire those are liars
when I met you I heard Jesus bells, strings and a choir
I got lines better than niggas albums, plural
king of the urban make your shit sound rural
she said I hit it so deep she need an epidural
them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
and thats nuts, I only hang around with white boys that like black sluts
tell em Plain Pat yo that track sucks
we aint dissin' you between the position you play something for us to listen to
I'm tryin' to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
i got scripts so why we need a movie
and if I'm a douche than put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loosely
and excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
boobie trap, holla back

[Swizz Beatz]
AK on the lap like whats that
clik clak
this is something special
this is something new
All white Bentley I call that momma
my life crazy like Obama's
you talk slick well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, whats happenin' I get it crackin'
all black carpet, Ima rich yeah
its gonna take you a couple years to get this here
thank AP while they thank me
and I'd be mad too if you aint me
call me Mr D's or Mister boss
see me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
niggas talking funny that's old money
niggas looking crazy but they acting funny
nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
you see me I'ma a bank (?)
coming through your hood and I brings trucks
with 25's on it like what the fuck
hundred feet and better why they fuck you stick
paparzzi on the water, why the fuck you stick
my face got the fuck you pricks
my beats go hard like fuck you dicks
pourin' champagne damn thing
sit there rockin' sway nigga in the damn ring
aint a damn thing, money aint a damn thing
ask Yeezy and most we do the god damn thing
get down to the precious lovers

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Ayo open glass on my fingers
I sit back like I'm caged but still cakin'
my niggas is hatin'
it's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
you a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon
every project is a throne, only just bigger stones they throw
that why I wear a big hat and roll weed
gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
all you know is weed and cocaine
non believers no game
I'm zooted down, rollin' a spliff
maxin' flamin' like wheres the attraction
I'm son he's attracted
guaranteed to service the real niggas
or cruisin' in a Volvo
duffy for dolo
puffy polo
that blow house is where I reside
live amongst fiends, countin' currency hittin' blunts
only to hear the door rumble
grab the four hope it aint the law
or maybe some nigga tryna score

[Charlie Wilson]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
