Bitches in the back don't like me though (Why!?)
I can't tell you 'bout stupid hoes (Why!?)
I bet she don't act stupid though

Cause I cut a bitch, ugh
I fucked a bitch, go and find another bitch and I never trust a bitch
You done text a nigga thirty times on some baby mother shit
Talkin' 'bout you celibate
But she still suck a dick
This that half a brick quarterbrick, aye!
Come and place your order bitch more of that gutter shit

New Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back she don't like me though (Why!?)
I don't know she might be broke (Why!?)
I can't tell you 'bout stupid hoes (Why!?)
I bet she don't act stupid though

She know that I had sex with 'em
If she tryna get lit, then go ahead light a ho
What you bitches fighting for, now
I can't even, that's why you can't sit with us
You need to just sit your ass down
I heard you fucked a nigga, well I fucked that nigga too
And then he probably didn't tell you, that's what sucka niggas do
And if he hadn't tested me he woulda never fucked with you

Cause that New Rihanna in the front, bitch
Bitches in the back she don't like me though (Why!?)
Side piece 'bout to let wifey know (Why!?)
Thirsty hoes is tryna get chose (Why!?)
I bet she don't act stupid though

Cut that bitch in the bathroom
Cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I catch that bitch in the bathroom
I bet you need to quit playing
Quit playing with me, bruh
Got a nigga fucked up, up in here

You know what I'm saying? That bitch saying she don't like me, you ask her why she [?]... I don't know, just like some shit stupid bitches say, you know I'm saying?

[Bibi Bourelly:] Like I can't even deal with this shit right now, this bitch is crazy, she must have lost her fucking mind. I'm tired of going back and forth with this ho, what the fuck? I can't even deal. Who the fuck does this bitch think she is?
