Lot of dangerous necessity that people seek without regard
To where they are, the human heart is curious above all things,
laa the lights are low
your eyes are bright
the music, makes it sweet delight
It's out inside, I'm feeling right
your dress is tight
Oh waaaa ow, I want you right now

Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
