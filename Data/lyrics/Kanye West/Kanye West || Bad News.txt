[Verse 1]
Didn't you know 
I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream 
That'll never come true
Didn't you know 
I was waiting on you
My face turnt to stone
When I heard the news

[Chorus]
When you decide to break the rules
Cos I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2]
People will talk
Like its old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you 
How long have you known too
You played it off and act like he's brand new

[Chorus]
When you decide to break the rules
Cos I just heard some real bad news

[Bridge]
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

Oh you just gonna 
Keep another no you wont

Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew

Oh you just gonna 
Keep another love for you

Oh you just gonna
Keep it ike you never knew

While im waiting on a dream 
That'll never come true

Oh you just gonna 
Keep it like you never knew

My face turnt to stone
When I heard the news

Whats on the news
