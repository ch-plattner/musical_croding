Don't look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Lupe Fiasco]
Head to the sky, wings raised in
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she'll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

[Mos Def]
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Mos Def]
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don't look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

How could you do it
How could you do it

[Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can't it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I'm testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Y" sometimes like a fucking vowel
But hitting tree's everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Mos Def]
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
