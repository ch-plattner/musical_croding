
Love the way I feel
Streets replaced with fields
Wide awake in here
You shine

Ran away from goals
Left you in the cold
Nothing's in our way
Tonight

You know that you'll never be replaced
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me
And either way our time won't go to waste
Our hearts will never be the same again

Our hearts will never be the same again
