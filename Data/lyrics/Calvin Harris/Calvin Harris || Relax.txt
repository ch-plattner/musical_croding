Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax
Relax

Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back

Relax
I've got the coat and the jackets to match
We can replace everything that you lack
Take a book and a nicotine patch

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax
Relax
Relax

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax
