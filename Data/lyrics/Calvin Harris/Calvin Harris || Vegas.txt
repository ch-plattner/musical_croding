I've got my car, and my ride, and my wheels 
When I go to Vegas, that's right 

I've got my drugs, and my stuff, and my pills 
When I go to Vegas, alright 

I've got my girls, and my boys, and my girls 
When I go to Vegas, that's right 

I've got my car, and my ride, and my wheels 
When I go to Vegas 

[repeat]

I've got my car, car, car, car, car, car, car, car, car, car, car 
[repeat]

I've got my car, and my ride, and my wheels 
When I go to Vegas, that's right 

I've got my drugs, and my stuff, and my pills 
When I go to Vegas, alright 

I've got my girls, and my boys, and my girls 
When I go to Vegas, that's right 

I've got my car, and my ride, and my wheels 
When I go to Vegas 

[repeat]

When I go to Vegas, when I go to Vegas 
When I go to Vegas, when I go to Vegas
