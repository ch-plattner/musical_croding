how you began creating disco?

Well it was the mid 70's
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And um, I was conducting various sonic experiments
with the assistance of Mary, my wife

Anyway, during one session I discovered
that by using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
and that was the night I created disco

I created 
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]

Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]
Disco [x8]

Would you just like to tell us, how you began creating disco, disco, disco, disco, disco?
