Let’s go!
Make no excuses now
I’m talking here and now
I’m talking here and now

Let’s go!
Your time is running out
I’m talking here and now
I’m talking here and now

It’s not about what you’ve done
It’s about what you doing
It’s all about where you going
No matter where you’ve been
Let’s go!

Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!

There ain’t no better time
I’m talking here and now
I’m talking here and now

Let’s go!
Right now is where you shine
I’m talking here and now
I’m talking here and now

It’s not about what you’ve done
It’s about what you doing
It’s all about where you going
No matter where you’ve been
Let’s go!

Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!

Let’s make it happen
Ooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Ooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Ooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Ooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s go!

Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Let’s go!
