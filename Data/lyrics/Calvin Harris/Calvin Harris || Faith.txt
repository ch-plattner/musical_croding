I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

I need a little faith
