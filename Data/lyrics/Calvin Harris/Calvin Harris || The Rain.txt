
She's the type of girl that makes you feel better
It don't matter how you used to feel
She's the kind of girl that follows good weather
And the sun brings out her sex appeal
If you want to talk to her it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh I bet that you can hear the rain

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it will be alright

How do you think I could make you feel better
How do I know what you say is real
Like did an imaginary love letter
Talking mostly 'bout her sex appeal
If you want to talk to her it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh I bet that you can hear the rain
