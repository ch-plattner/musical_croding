I've got to stop waiting for you,
and move onto someone new.
But everything around me is blue.
The colour that reminds me of you.

I've got to stop looking back,
my head can get lost off track.
I know that you're not comin' back.
But Lord I wish you would now.

I feel like my life got shot.
I feel like my love's shop bought.
I'm looking at people I'm not, no I'm not, no my baby.
I feel like my life got shot.
I feel like my love's shop bought.
I'm looking at people I'm not, no, no, no.

Well I think there's nothing left to lose.
I take a look at what's in front of you.
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose.
I'm a man who loves the colour blue.

Well I think there's nothing left to lose.
I take a look at what's in front of you.
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose.
I'm a man who loves the colour blue. [x2]

Well I think there's nothing left to lose.

It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose.
