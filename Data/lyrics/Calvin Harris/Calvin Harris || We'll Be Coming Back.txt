
We took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus:]
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Beat break]

You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus:]
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts

[Beat break]

[Chrous:]
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
