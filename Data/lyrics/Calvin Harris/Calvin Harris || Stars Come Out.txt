
Lying in the grass,
watching the stars come out.

Come and get the dream.
Ghosts right through the cemetery.
Feel the morning rain,
dancing 'round the colosseum.
I can not explain
something in your chemistry.
Power to your brain.
Power to the minds museum.

Come and get the dream.
Ghosts right through the cemetery.
Feel the morning rain
dancing round the colosseum.
I can not explain
something in your chemistry.
Power to your brain.

We can watch the stars come out.
Find out what we like about
everyone, without a doubt.
We can watch the stars come out. [x4]

Lying in the grass

Watch the stars come out. [x13]
