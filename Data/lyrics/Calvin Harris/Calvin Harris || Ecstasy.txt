
Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
We know that we're brave enough to be

In the state of ecstacy
In the place we're meant to be
In the state of ecstacy
There is only you and me

Break through from the other side
And lead me to Paradise
Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Ever time I close my eyes, we disappear

In the state of ecstacy
In the place we're meant to be
In the state of ecstacy
There is only you and me

Uh uuh, eh eh
Uh uuh, eh eh
Uh uuh, eh eh
Uh uuh, eh eh

In the state of ecstacy
In the place we're meant to be
In the state of ecstacy
There is only you and me
