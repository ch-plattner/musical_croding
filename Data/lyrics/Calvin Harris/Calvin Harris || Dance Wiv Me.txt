
What's up darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there in your jack jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it worth it
You got a body to die for, let me work it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dancefloor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance so I guess I'll just ask

She ain't no hoe
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes
She's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me

If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me

Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved
You done nothin wrong
Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it
You look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it
So let's get to it

She ain't no hoe
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes
She's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me

I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes
Put your skills on show, oh

If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me

If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me
