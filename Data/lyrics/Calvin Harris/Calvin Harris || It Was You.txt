And it was you who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you changed my way
Baby, it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you, got me babe
It was you who's changed my way
It was you

It was you, got me babe
And it was you who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you changed my way
Baby, it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you, got me babe
It was you who's changed my way
It was you
