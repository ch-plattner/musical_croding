
Stop bein' a bad joke
It's not the same
Feeling that sunshine
And forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful
Without the rain
Your life's got happy
You got on the TV

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

Being with each other
We're havin' fun
I've got time to spare so
I might find the one
We dig each other
And break the rules
We love one another
And that's no fool

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

I take a piece of paper
And write your name
You put it in your pocket
And I did the same
We love each other
And that's for sure
I live here without you
I can't take it no more

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
