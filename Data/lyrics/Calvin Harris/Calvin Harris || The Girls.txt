
I like them black girls
I like them white girls
I like them asian girls
I like them mixed race girls
I like them Spanish girls
I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls
And I like Scandanavian girls

I like them tall girls
I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls
I like them blonde haired girls
I like them big girls
I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bit of weight girls

Now baby (baby)
I've got alot of love to give
And I've been over
over-subscribed with relationships
See you've got (you've got)
A little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya
That I can't help but play around for sure, for sure
Because

I get all the girls, I get all the girls [8x]

Now maybe (maybe)
I can learn to settle down one day
But right now
I'm living life to mess around and play
See you've got (you've got)
A little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya
That I can't help but play around for sure
I did it before

I get all the girls, I get all the girls [8x]

I like them black girls
I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls
I like them mixed race girls
I like them Spanish girls
I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls
And I like Scandinavian girls

I like them tall girls
I like them short girls
I like them brown hair girls
I like them blonde hair girls
I like them big girls
I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bitty weight girls

I get all the girls, I get all the girls [8x]
