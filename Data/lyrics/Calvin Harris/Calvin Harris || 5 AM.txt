
Tryna live my life anyway that I like it
Never let a [?] mess up my high
Something 'bout, they hit me by surprise
She, feelin' hella sprung, if you with it then you got it
I've been waitin' up, nothin' on but your chain now
Filling up the tub, what's the scent of the day now
Boy you can't resist it, boy you know you miss it
Can we find a way?

5 AM I can't eat right, I can't sleep night
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby

5 AM and I want you baby
5 AM and I want you baby

What you tryna play boy, you know I'm ready
I'm like a buffet, body's yours for the taking
Almost done for breakfast, tell me you gon' make it
Hungry, hungry boy, you'll be begging for the bacon
Practicing my tricks, I got plenty
Throw one down right now if you'd let me
Tell me what you like
Ride if you ready, ride if you ready, ride if you ready

5 AM I can't eat right, I can't sleep night
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby

5 AM and I want you baby
5 AM and I want you baby

Cause it's 5am, 5am I can't eat right
I can't sleep right
Won't do anything without you
Can't do anything without you

5 AM I can't eat right, I can't sleep night
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby

5 AM and I want you baby
5 AM and I want you baby
