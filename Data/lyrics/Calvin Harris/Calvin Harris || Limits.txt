
And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today.
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I look twice at your girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

But now suddenly, I don't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you
It's not good for me, I can't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today.
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm looking twice at your girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends [x4]
