Izza kizza
Girl

My first mistake was ltting you into my life (Yes it was)
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed (Laying in my bed)
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Oh, I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you,
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)

I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that our heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days

This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)

See yesterday I called her back
The day before I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago I did my thang
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow I thought we could chill
There won't be, yes, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see Cupid he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said take two, and he said call me in the morning
It's the worst day

This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
And it's true 'cos all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)

This must be the worst day of my life [x2]
My life
