
Inside me,
Inside me is a flame,
That burns brighter any time you came.

Gets in the way, when I'm alone with you,
But disappears if I'm with someone new,
It learned how to fit into my foreplay,
With my skills our love was going okay.

Until the night when we were on the phone,
You're moving on and want better.

Ow!

Uh, oh yeah.
Uh, oh
