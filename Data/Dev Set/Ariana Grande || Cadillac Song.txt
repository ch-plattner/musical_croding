Ridin' round in my Cadillac
Thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothin' compares to what we had
And baby that won't change
I want you babe
I still want you babe
I still want you
You, yeah

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one
I never thought we would change
Baby I'm missing you

Oh we shoulda been forever but fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
And sometimes I catch myself

Ridin' round in my Cadillac
Thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothin compares to what we had
And baby that won't change
I want you babe
I still want you babe
I still want you
You
Yea

Memories last forever
So how could I just forget
Made everything from nothin' cause time was all we spent

Oh we shoulda been forever but fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
And sometimes I catch myself

Ridin' round in my Cadillac
Thinkin' bout the day that I first saw you
Nothin compares to what we had
And baby that won't change
I want you babe
I still want you babe
I still want you
You
Yea
