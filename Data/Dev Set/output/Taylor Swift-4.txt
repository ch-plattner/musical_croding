right there in my poems like a mess babe
wrote you a cat
and sweat and tears keep
when you tried to teach me from your past life
you wanna go fast i need somewhere to be living
block to my door and all my friends
people that you hear is from above you
am i right
happens if you knew our lives
the players gonna play play play play play play play play

together with a smile on your couch
all you have been different but in a box beneath
and it troubles my
a snow globe round and round and dragging down
one single word they say i’ve always known since
yourself that was a moment full
off again last night man
be you and i'll bet you think we'd be
you still look amazing
the many saying

church at the sight
it this time of year
windows and the way down
stars had just aligned
sad empty town
sad empty town
had something to see how far i can save them for a
you are an expert at sorry
came and our daddies used to say and
and the story’s got dust on every page

together with a smile on your couch
all you have been different but in a box beneath
and it troubles my
a snow globe round and round and dragging down
one single word they say i’ve always known since
yourself that was a moment full
off again last night man
be you and i'll bet you think we'd be
you still look amazing
the many saying

and a liar and pathetic and alone in a frame
looking out into the skies
look like my next mistake
supposed to hear sleigh bells in the purple
to see my way out the door and left

together with a smile on your couch
all you have been different but in a box beneath
and it troubles my
a snow globe round and round and dragging down
one single word they say i’ve always known since
yourself that was a moment full
off again last night man
be you and i'll bet you think we'd be
you still look amazing
the many saying
