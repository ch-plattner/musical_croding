Theme: need, get, right, boy, heart, yeah, way, know, baby, love

if you want on
to me for a couple more days
one who takes you home who still
one who takes you home who still
i'm tryna' play it cool
baby teach me the way you're talking sro
love i'm alive
avenue honeymoon avenue honeymoon avenue honeymoon avenue honeymoon

i'll be better off without you baby
j'aurais dû mieux te traiter
listen you got the cash i'm
listen you got the cash i'm
we can deny it as i love too hard
get over you

going out to stay and pray you'll
think you're beautiful
making me crazy restless dumb and blind
know the feeling of liberation and relief
and you're never gonna let
screaming just to watch him as
in between them
but now i'm gonna quit me

i'll be better off without you baby
j'aurais dû mieux te traiter
listen you got the cash i'm
listen you got the cash i'm
we can deny it as i love too hard
get over you

shining every night i promise i promise you won't keep
can't pretend anymore
touch what's in my heart all in your
i can't be looking for me to mess this up

i'll be better off without you baby
j'aurais dû mieux te traiter
listen you got the cash i'm
listen you got the cash i'm
we can deny it as i love too hard
get over you
