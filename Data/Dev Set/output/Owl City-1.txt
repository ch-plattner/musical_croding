Theme: world, way, top, live, unbelievable, tonight, good, hope, time, shine

so i walk alone down the darkest roads
'cause i've always known how the story goes
when the curtain falls i'll be wearing thin
clawing at the walls as they're closing in
in this twisted plot i was destined for
i'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
so misunderstood 'till the bloody end
how i wish i could do it all again

it feels like i'm a lone survivor
forgotten in a dark and deadly world
and on my own i walk alone
to see the sun again i'd give anything
but life demands a final chapter
a story that we all must leave behind
it's do or die and this is mine
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing

it's another night of the living dead
like a viper bite in a spiderweb
it's so deathly dark in the alleyway
and a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
i would run and hide for the afternoon
with the butterfly in the panic room
though i won't be missed i would say it's time
for a different twist in the story line

it feels like i'm a lone survivor
forgotten in a dark and deadly world
and on my own i walk alone
to see the sun again i'd give anything
but life demands a final chapter
a story that we all must leave behind
it's do or die and this is mine
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing

it feels like i'm a lone survivor
forgotten in a dark and deadly world
and on my own i walk alone
to see the sun again i'd give anything
but life demands a final chapter
a story that we all must leave behind
it's do or die and this is mine
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing
the anthem of a bird with a broken wing

tell the world i know that my mind is made
it's a horror show but i'm not afraid
though i won't be missed i would say it's time
for a different twist in the story line
