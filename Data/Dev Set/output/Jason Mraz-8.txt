well easily with me i show affection
but it's a creepin' up a creepin' up on me in another direction

i love i write and i die
and i try to ask no questions
but the weary one is still me
do you think its obsession

the smoke will find you a choker that matches your coat not fit to be tied
the mirror it makes it all clearer as you stand alone and cant see your behind
yea
they tried to tell me i could say that nobody could believe this
well they tried to tell me i could say nobody could achieve this
the way you stayed of locked away of
keeping the flame for yourself 
the way you stayed of pushin' the blame of reaping the fame for yourself

oh well it's a it's a dead end
it's a dead end
oh it's a dead end lonely day
say it's a dead end
it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a dead end day
it's a dead end oh day
and it's a long way a long way down
hey well it's a long way a long way down

change is a coming a baby 
don't be startled lady
every once in a while they do it again
you gonna shake it shake it
you know you wanna take it
back to where you once belonged
back beneath the sheets and between the pillow cases
and the snake he races out and he he tangles into your hair
funny the fruits you choose
oh the time you take the words you loose
and it all goes back to rotation over the back of your hand
oh the back of your hand oh the back of your hand
oh the map is your hand 
it's the back of your hand the back of your hand
say the back of your hand oh the map is your hand it's the back of your hand

stop whining all the time
don't you find a little secret to yourself always saved your life 
stop listening to the words that you've heard
no one else but yourself will agree with you more
that it's a long long way
it's a long long way
and it's a long long way a long way down
hey and it's a long way down 
and it's a lo- oh- oh- ng way down
hey hey hey and it's a long long long long way down
say say scats
and it's a lo- oh- oh- ng way down hey and it's a long way down
it's a dead end
it's a dead end oh
it's a dead end lonely day
it's a it's a dead end
it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a dead end day
it's a dead end oh day
