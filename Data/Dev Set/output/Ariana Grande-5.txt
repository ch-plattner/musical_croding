when your reflection
and what you want it to be
oh no
you change your clothes
change your hair
change your makeup
but you still don’t like the vision you see
i wish it were that easy
when your rejection
is only coming from you
oh no
the way you walk
way you talk every second
you can’t believe what life’s been putting you through
it’s time
to take a look inside
the beauty within you
whoa oh oh oh
it’s the hardest thing to find
oh oh oh oh
as the mirror makes you blind
to who you really are
cause you’re beautiful like a shining star
you can love the world with all your heart
but to love yourself is the
hardest part
when your emotions
have got the better of you
oh no no
you start to scream
hit the walls
start to freak out
you can’t believe what life’s been putting you through
it’s time to take a look inside
the beauty within you
oh oh oh oh
as the mirror makes you blind
to who you really are
cause you’re beautiful like a shining star
you can love the world with all your heart
you can love the world with all your heart
but to love yourself
is the hardest part
the beauty within you
oh oh oh oh
its the hardest thing to find
oh oh oh oh
as the mirror makes you blind
oh oh oh oh
as the mirror makes you blind
a beautiful a shining star
ohh the beauty within you
