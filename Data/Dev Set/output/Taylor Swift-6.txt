Theme: back, running, made, fly, starlight, remember, rains, ooh, come, la

know if i'll know your face girl
loveâ€™s a little messy and you got that long hair slicked back
asking me if i'm alright
know who i'm dating
a boat whoa oh little
like a burning hot
on come on babe
on come on babe
around here thinking it through

and i bet if i really gotta
coming wouldn't have told nobody if i didn't bring
i might fall in love with this song
i might fall in love with this song
had the best soy latte that you were bad news and where
your little hand's wrapped around my life just to come home crying
over baby we can come

to make you mad what
i might get on the winner
how'd we end up going
the best view
god smiles on my guitar
out my flaws again
my way out the light and your full on
a roller coaster kinda rush
ooh-ooh ye-e-e-e-eah hey

and i bet if i really gotta
coming wouldn't have told nobody if i didn't bring
i might fall in love with this song
i might fall in love with this song
had the best soy latte that you were bad news and where
your little hand's wrapped around my life just to come home crying
over baby we can come

know that every time you said forever and ever forever
one's ever burned you nothing's ever enough
god forbid fate should decide
smile you lips and rosy cheeks say

and i bet if i really gotta
coming wouldn't have told nobody if i didn't bring
i might fall in love with this song
i might fall in love with this song
had the best soy latte that you were bad news and where
your little hand's wrapped around my life just to come home crying
over baby we can come
