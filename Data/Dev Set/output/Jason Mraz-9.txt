well you're magic he said
but don't let it all go to your head
cuz i bet if you all had it all figured out
then you'd never get out of bed
no doubt
of all the thing's that i've read what he wrote me
is now sounding like the man i was hoping
to be
i keep on keeping it real
cause it keeps getting easier he'll see
he's the reason that i'm laughing
even if there's no one else
he said you've got to love yourself

you say you shouldn't mumble when you speak
but keep your tongue up in your cheek
and if you stumble onto something better remember that it's humble that you seek
you got all the skill you need
individuality
you got something
you call it gumption
you call it anything you want
because when you play the fool now
you're only fooling everyone else
you're learning to love yourself

yes you are

there's no price to pay
when you give and what you take
that's why it's easy to thank you
you

let's say take a break from the day
and get back to the old garage
because life's too short anyway
but at least it's better then average
as long as you got me
and i got you
you know we'll got a lot to go around
i'll be your friend
your other brother
another love to come and comfort you
and i'll keep reminding
if it's the only thing i ever do
i will always love
i will always love you
yes you
i will always always always always love
i will always always love
i will always always love love

climb up over the top
survey the state of the soul
you've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying
why not give it a shot
shake it take control and inevitably wind up
find out for yourself all the strengths you have inside of you
