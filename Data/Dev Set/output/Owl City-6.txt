Theme: could, time, light, say, night, love, way, shine, eyes, oh

and a reason on
just can't get you off my mind i
but should my head get bare like friar
well i bet it knows
the blankets on the night turn light blue
every shove every war every love lost none
and if you ever gentle
and if you ever gentle
you like to play pretend let's
limits my regards as you float as i
left me feeling sick like

work out all right now it's cold so surround me
was so enchanted to meet you in my dreams are
thirst for milk instead
i was enchanted to meet me better
the beast he froze
midnight streets feel dead anymore
be so awfully dull
dreams like air traffic streams
pages that i knew what to think
pages that i knew what to think
soft snowflakes kiss us
my summer sky

i don't feel sorry
christmas shining through
with my heart you're here with me misery loves
you were my first love
and rather than flaunt my style
shelter that is the ending well nobody knows
you won't ever feel again
and sun drops
this was the very first page of our tears
as it starts tonight
so if you're the best we both know

work out all right now it's cold so surround me
was so enchanted to meet you in my dreams are
thirst for milk instead
i was enchanted to meet me better
the beast he froze
midnight streets feel dead anymore
be so awfully dull
dreams like air traffic streams
pages that i knew what to think
pages that i knew what to think
soft snowflakes kiss us
my summer sky

not take flight i'll crash and burn where fire and steel
of waiting for
of your fingerprints was found and the chatty tree frogs will
you and you pick me up when you hear
harbor this paddle boat

work out all right now it's cold so surround me
was so enchanted to meet you in my dreams are
thirst for milk instead
i was enchanted to meet me better
the beast he froze
midnight streets feel dead anymore
be so awfully dull
dreams like air traffic streams
pages that i knew what to think
pages that i knew what to think
soft snowflakes kiss us
my summer sky
