didn't i give it all
tried my best
gave you everything i had
everything and no less
didn't i do it right
did i let you down

maybe you got too used to
well having me around
still how can you walk away
from all my tears
it's gonna be an empty road
without me right here

but go on and take it
take it all with you
don't look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it all
with my love
take it all
with my love

maybe i should leave
to help you see
nothing is better than this
and this is everything we need
so is it over
is this really it
you've given up so easily
i thought you loved me more than this

but go on go on and take it
take it all with you
don't look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it all
with my love
take it all
with my love

i will change if i must
slow it down and bring it home i will adjust
oh if only if only you knew
everything i do is for you

but go on
go on and take it
take it all with you
don't look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it
take it all with you
don't look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it all
with my love
take it all
with my love
take it all
with my love
