ridin' round in my cadillac
thinkin' 'bout the day that i first saw you
nothin' compares to what we had
and baby that won't change
i want you babe
i still want you babe
i still want you
you yeah

summer days with my honey
worried 'bout not a thing
back in the day when things were easier than the breeze
who knew that kiss was the last one
i never thought we would change
baby i'm missing you

oh we shoulda been forever but fell apart
might have separated but you took my heart
always knew i wasn't really over us
and sometimes i catch myself

ridin' round in my cadillac
thinkin' 'bout the day that i first saw you
nothin compares to what we had
and baby that won't change
i want you babe
i still want you babe
i still want you
you
yea

memories last forever
so how could i just forget
made everything from nothin' cause time was all we spent

oh we shoulda been forever but fell apart
might have separated but you took my heart
always knew i wasn't really over us
and sometimes i catch myself

ridin' round in my cadillac
thinkin' bout the day that i first saw you
nothin compares to what we had
and baby that won't change
i want you babe
i still want you babe
i still want you
you
yea
