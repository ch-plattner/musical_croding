untouchable like a distant diamond sky mmmm
i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you why
i'm caught up in you i'm caught up in you
untouchable burning brighter than the sun
and when you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on come on
say that we'll be together
come on come on
little taste of heaven

it's half full and i won't wait here all day
i know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
but you're untouchable
burning brighter than the sun
now that you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on come on
say that we'll be together
come on come on

oh in the middle of the night
waking from this dream
i wanna feel you by my side
standing next to me
you gotta come on come on
say that we'll be together
come on come on
little taste of heaven

oh oh i'm caught up in you
oh oh oh
untouchable burning brighter than the sun
and when you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on come on
say that we'll be together
come on come on oh oh

oh oh in the middle of the night
waking from this dream
i wanna feel you by my side
standing next to me
you gotta come on come on
say that we'll be together
come on come on
little taste of heaven

like a million little stars spelling out your name
spelling out your name
