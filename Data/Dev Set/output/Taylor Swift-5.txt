Theme: grow, eh, wonderland, swift, knows, uh, beautiful, new, girl, welcome

as i was raised
knock on wood and wire and
you changed the rules everyday
girls hopeful they'll be taken
with just me and took away
it's in the silence silence
can i go to work cause
at you and say hello to you ha
be out of the fact that she's really
thought there for a couple hits
swept you out 'cause i'll never never be apart
don’t know what you wrote on the lake to
i'm not your typical princess
i'm not your typical princess

didn't see it apart
i’ve ever known
gonna be a long chain
gonna be a long chain
baby you'd be late
miss you too much champagne
colors in his office downtown
you were so damn happy
your best to avoid me
like i'm a take ya
out on a wire see
coffee at midnight
if you saw me cry when
to go again
crept in and whispered in your pockets and
first name big last name trouble

many years before
right there where i wanted what i do recall
wishing i'd realized what i would one
wishing i'd realized what i would one
you please don't have no
a west bound train on
just a puppet on a wire
the parking lot
when we were the nights got cold
when we were the nights got cold
picture frame is empty
and don't ever take
please take me home where we are is
shaped like a mess and

didn't see it apart
i’ve ever known
gonna be a long chain
gonna be a long chain
baby you'd be late
miss you too much champagne
colors in his office downtown
you were so damn happy
your best to avoid me
like i'm a take ya
out on a wire see
coffee at midnight
if you saw me cry when
to go again
crept in and whispered in your pockets and
first name big last name trouble

i could slow down time
lights like diamonds in my head on a
i close my eyes went wild
song for you sweet
calling me up and he's long gone when we're on
too much heart to stone
might still have everythin'

didn't see it apart
i’ve ever known
gonna be a long chain
gonna be a long chain
baby you'd be late
miss you too much champagne
colors in his office downtown
you were so damn happy
your best to avoid me
like i'm a take ya
out on a wire see
coffee at midnight
if you saw me cry when
to go again
crept in and whispered in your pockets and
first name big last name trouble
