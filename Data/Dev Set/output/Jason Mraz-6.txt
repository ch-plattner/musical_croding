Theme: take, back, go, know, see, way, get, well, oh, love

when i’m with you we can make yourself available
and i'm underlined already in the tight up
try to buy you a pop
you woke up next
to talk about it in all my beliefs
inhale all the teachers like the class you
of life they taught me generosity
back and then i kissed a star that i barely knew

and play it at the nightlight
in your life we
i'll wait for you i thought i
i'll wait for you i thought i
that i've been deprived can you feel the party
better things for all their sorrows
i report to work where everybody goes
come to be cryin’ i
more than a rain cloud

nally and give us both a break
keep up with m-r-a-z
is all i'm looking right all
label puts me in my picture in a situation in
and lick my persuasion
how beautiful oh my the congregation in my song
yourself every day every night
yourself every day every night

and play it at the nightlight
in your life we
i'll wait for you i thought i
i'll wait for you i thought i
that i've been deprived can you feel the party
better things for all their sorrows
i report to work where everybody goes
come to be cryin’ i
more than a rain cloud

my minds running to play say you
you got was too much too much or a beautiful house
come back i'd relax and let me get paid
squalor and spend the night a young

and play it at the nightlight
in your life we
i'll wait for you i thought i
i'll wait for you i thought i
that i've been deprived can you feel the party
better things for all their sorrows
i report to work where everybody goes
come to be cryin’ i
more than a rain cloud
