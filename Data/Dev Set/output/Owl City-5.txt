Theme: see, way, life, oh, take, know, away, time, never, shine

way to choose
words i held back as i want so
a light show out my wings and i dreaded
girl with a starry night without a fear of
this one way track
curse has lost its grip on me
everyone so you gotta shine
smile came back from
the sound when you close and fail the
rescued me and you say you did
was the lobster shell
brilliant showroom light
on the night with a humble

the sun rose up from nothing
'yes' and 'no'
and good night and i think of me when you parachute
and the road let's
me a challenge and i'll always love you forever
i'm pacing back and i didn't wanna
to the dreams and disasters
with no love in the stars around
this isn't the shit
as he stands in victory you
a satellite sending you back
aboard a jet plane
searched again and again
searched again and again
you fight to survive 'cause you always

me in a hot crush
foxtrot above my town bitch
your river wanders wanders x3
your river wanders wanders x3
the atmosphere is crawling with airlines
never felt this low
hole in my despair
hole in my despair
see the light to the heart on mine
isnâ€™t perfectly right
my best friends but
now it's cold but i know the part it's such
in the evening tide

the sun rose up from nothing
'yes' and 'no'
and good night and i think of me when you parachute
and the road let's
me a challenge and i'll always love you forever
i'm pacing back and i didn't wanna
to the dreams and disasters
with no love in the stars around
this isn't the shit
as he stands in victory you
a satellite sending you back
aboard a jet plane
searched again and again
searched again and again
you fight to survive 'cause you always

was so enchanted to meet me
memories so sweet that i have is yours
a cold seahorse
a cold seahorse
were paved with the way she whispered in my new
here in the solar eclipse

the sun rose up from nothing
'yes' and 'no'
and good night and i think of me when you parachute
and the road let's
me a challenge and i'll always love you forever
i'm pacing back and i didn't wanna
to the dreams and disasters
with no love in the stars around
this isn't the shit
as he stands in victory you
a satellite sending you back
aboard a jet plane
searched again and again
searched again and again
you fight to survive 'cause you always
