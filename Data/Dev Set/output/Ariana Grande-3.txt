slow down you crazy child
you're so ambitious for a juvenile
but then if you're so smart then tell me
why are you still so afraid mmmmm

where's the fire what's the hurry about
you better cool it off before you burn it out
you got so much to do and only
so many hours in a day ay

but you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through oooh
when will you realize vienna waits for you

slow down you're doing fine
you can't be everything you want to be before your time
although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight tonight

too bad but it's the life you lead
you're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
though you can see when you're wrong
you know you can't always see when you're right you're right

you got your passion you got your pride
but don't you know that only fools are satisfied
dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true
when will you realize vienna waits for you

slow down you crazy child
take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
it's alright you can afford to lose a day or two oooh
when will you realize vienna waits for you

and you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want or you can just get old
you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
why don't you realize vienna waits for you

when will you realize vienna waits for you
