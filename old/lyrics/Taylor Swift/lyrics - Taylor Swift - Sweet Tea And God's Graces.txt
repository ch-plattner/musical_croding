
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember.........

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah
