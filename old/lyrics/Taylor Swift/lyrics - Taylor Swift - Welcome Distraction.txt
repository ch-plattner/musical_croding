
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Love’s a little messy and you are too
Right now I’m scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn’t gonna stray 
Swore I’d never let a man in my way

You’re the last thing I needed today

And I don’t know 
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can’t talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

You’re the last thing I needed tonight

And I don’t know 
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

I’m acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I don’t know 
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh
